['Honor 9X: Another phone in the pop-up train!'],['Honor'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['July 4, 2019']",2019-07-04 11:14:47+00:00,"['A successor the  Honor 8X , the  Honor 9X  will be making its  debut on July 23 . Posters of the launch are already out and about, so, it’s confirmed. However, the phone is still in its leaks and rumors stages. And we have not much information about what the phone will pack, except for some key details.  The Honor 9X will feature Huawei’s latest chipset, the  Kirin 810 . Given that the chipset came out just a few weeks ago, for mid-range, this doesn’t come as a surprise at all. With this chipset running the show, we can expect the Honor 9X to go head to head against the  Samsung Galaxy A80  (because of similar chipsets), but pricing should mean it will actually compete with the  A70 . Benchmark scores of the Kirin 810 outperformed the Snapdragon 730, but real-world usage can make a difference.         Other than that, a leaked schematic of the Honor 9X reveals a full edge-to-edge design with a  pop-up selfie camera . Looks like motorized parts are the trend, and most of the phones are following suit. Probably because pop-up cameras are the easier approach to delivering that full-screen experience.  Also, the Honor 9X leaks show a  dual camera set up  at the back, but no fingerprint scanner. And that can only mean one thing – an  in-display fingerprint scanner ! Because it’s unlikely that these phones will move on to only Face Unlock altogether. We can also make out the design footprint of the device from the leaks, but that’s all.  So, will the Honor 9X make a big impact on the smartphone market? Considering the new powerful chipset, I think it will. Do let us know your thoughts…']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/honor-9x-1.jpg']
"['Camera-centric Xiaomi MI CC9, CC9e, and CC9 Meitu Edition launched']",['Xiaomi'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['July 3, 2019']",2019-07-03 11:05:43+00:00,"['Xiaomi has, probably, the most number of different series of smartphones. They target almost all ranges of customers. And as if Xiaomi was not enough, it has two sub-brands. But despite all these, Xiaomi has introduced an entirely new series once again. And in this new MI CC9 series, the Chinese smartphone maker has lined up three new devices. The latest Xiaomi MI CC9, CC9e, and CC9 Meitu Edition seem to have been targeted at camera enthusiasts.  Xiaomi MI CC9  When it comes to MI CC9, there is a  6.39-inch Super AMOLED display  with  Full-HD resolution . The handset also features an  in-display   fingerprint scanner . The screen also features a tiny water-drop style notch on top of the display. And the whole front is encased with a tough  Corning Gorilla 5 .         The notch houses a  32MP selfie camera  and Xiaomi claims it to be best in its class. The selfie camera, as per the trends, will ship with a dedicated AI portrait mode for low light scenarios. Furthermore, the handset will have new Mimoji animated avatars.   As for the rear cameras, the MI CC9 packs a triple-camera setup. The primary shooter uses a  48MP camera  capped with an f/1.8 lens. Also, an  8MP ultra-wide camera  and a  2MP depth sensor  complete the camera package.   On the design front, the handset flaunts dual-glass design with a metal frame sandwiched in between. The “CC” in its name stands for  Colorful and Creative . Justifying the name, Xiaomi MI CC9 comes with an interesting light refracting finish. And this refractive rear panel shifts color according to the angle at which the light is incident.  As far as the performance is concerned, the handset gets the  Snapdragon 710 chipset  with  6GB or 8GB of RAM . Storage-wise, the handset comes in  64GB and 128GB variants . The phone boots on  Android Pie  with  MIUI 10  on the top. Supplying the power juice to the device is a  4030mAh battery , which comes with  18-watt fast charging  support.  Xiaomi MI CC9 Meitu Edition  Xiaomi had acquired Meitu last year. And commemorating the acquisition, Xiaomi released the Meitu Edition. This special edition is identical to the regular MI CC9 version with few tweaks on the camera front.   The device is targeted at the enthusiasts, who are into mobile vlogging. And for such enthusiasts, there are AI low light portrait mode, movie portrait, and full body beauty filters. This device also comes with a special vlog mode with video stabilization to open the possibilities for wannabe vloggers.   The Meitu Edition comes aboard with  8GB RAM ,  256GB storage , and in a  special pearl white color variant . Rest of the specs remains the same between MI CC9 and CC9 Meitu Edition.  Specifications:   Display : 6.39-inch Super AMOLED with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection  Resolution : Full-HD+ (2340 × 1080 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio @403PPI pixel density  Chipset : Snapdragon 710; 14nm Mobile Platform  CPU : Octa-core (2×2.2 GHz Kryo 360 Gold & 6×1.7 GHz Kryo 360 Silver)  GPU : Adreno 616  RAM : 6GB (Regular Version); 8GB (Meitu Edition)  Storage : 64/128GB (Regular Version), 256GB (Meitu Edition); expandable memory up to 256GB with micro SD  Software & UI : Android 9.0 (Pie) with\xa0MIUI 10  Rear Camera : Triple Camera setup – (48MP primary camera, f/1.8 aperture, PDAF) + (8MP ultra-wide-angle) + (2MP depth sensor), LED flash  Front Camera : 32MP, f/2.0  Sensors : Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery : 4030mAh battery with 18-watt fast charging   Xiaomi MI CC9e  The “e” on its name stands for Essential Edition. And it’s essentially a toned down version of the Xiaomi MI CC9. CC9e comes with a slightly smaller  6.01-inch Super AMOLED display  coupled with  HD+ resolution . Although the size and resolution have been toned down, Xiaomi kept the  UD fingerprint scanner  and  Gorilla Glass 5 protection  intact. The camera module has not changed either. There is the same  32MP selfie shooter  and the  triple rear cameras  have barely changed.   On the performance side, however, there is a slightly less powerful  Snapdragon 665 chipset . Memory wise, the phone comes in  4/64GB ,  6/64GB , and  6/128GB  variants. Powering the device is a  4030mAh battery , which comes with  18-watt fast charging  support.  Specifications:   Display : 6.01-inch Super AMOLED with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection  Resolution : HD+ (720 x 1560 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio @286PPI pixel density  Chipset : Snapdragon 665; 11nm Mobile Platform  CPU : Octa-core 2.0 GHz Kryo 260  GPU : Adreno 610  RAM : 4/6GB  Storage : 64/128GB; expandable memory up to 256GB with micro SD  Software & UI : Android 9.0 (Pie) with\xa0MIUI 10  Rear Camera : Triple Camera setup – (48MP primary camera, f/1.8 aperture, PDAF) + (8MP ultra-wide-angle) + (2MP depth sensor), LED flash  Front Camera : 32MP, f/2.0  Sensors : Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery : 4030mAh battery with 18-watt fast charging   Price & Availability  All these devices have launched in China and they are up for pre-booking as of now. The regular MI CC9 and CC9 Meitu edition will go on sale starting from the 5 th  of July. The affordable CC9e won’t be available for purchase until 9 th  of July. However, there is no information regarding the release of the device in the global market.  Price-wise, the MI CC9 is the most affordable of all. The base variant (4/64GB) of the device is priced at CNY 1,299 (NPR 20,800). Similarly, the 6/64GB and 6/128GB variants will cost CNY 1,399 (NPR 22,500) and CNY 1,599 (NPR 25,700) respectively.  The regular MI CC9 demands CNY 1,799 (NPR 22,900) for the 6GB/64GB storage option and CNY 1,999 (NPR 32,100) for the 6GB/128GB storage model. The CC9 Meitu Edition being the most premium of all will set you back CNY 2,599 (NPR 41, 750).']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/samsung-galaxy-cc9e-cc9-meitu-edition.jpg']
"['Nvidia’s new RTX SUPER cards – Same price, more performance']",['NVIDIA'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['July 3, 2019']",2019-07-03 11:03:07+00:00,"['Credit: Pcworld.com                  CreditAMD’s latest strategies are giving tough competition to both NVidia and Intel, lately, with their new Navi and Zen 2 architecture. Intel responded (but failed). And now, it looks like Nvidia’s turn to strike back. That they did, in the most non-Nvidia way, by launching three new value for money graphics cards. I personally think these cards should have been the original RTX series, but better late than never right?  AMD’s next-gen GPUs are set to launch soon, July 7 to be precise. And does that have something to do with the new trio of “SUPER” graphics chips from Nvidia? Maybe. Either way, let’s look at the all-new  RTX 2060 SUPER ,  RTX 2070 SUPER , and the  RTX 2080 SUPER.  Are these cards actually “super”, or are they just another false attempt to steal the spotlight?  NVIDIA RTX 2080 SUPER         The new RTX 2080 SUPER is  priced at $699  and is a direct replacement to their current  RTX 2080 . The notable improvements include increased memory speed, clock speeds tensor cores, RT Cores, and texture units. Even the Cuda Cores has increased alongside the streaming multiprocessors. Check out the graph below for numbers:     FEATURES  RTX 2080  RTX 2080 SUPER      CUDA Cores  2,944  3,072    Base Clock (MHz)  1,515  1,650    Boost Clock (MHz)  1,710  1,815    Tensor Cores  368  384    RT Cores  46  48    Texture Units  184  192    Memory Bandwidth  14 Gbps  15.6 Gbps    Total Bandwidth  448GB/s  496.1 GB/s    Memory Bus Width  256-bit  256-bit    GPU Architecture  Turing TU104  Turing TU104    Render Outputs  64  64    Memory Config  8GB  8GB    TDP  215W  250W    Price  $699  $699     Given the spec bump, the end result or the war performance numbers has gone up from 10 TFLOPs to 11.1 TFLOPs. That’s about an 11% boost in performance, both from the Founder’s edition cards of course. Reflecting on all this, the TDP has gone up from 215W to 250W. Nvidia even claims the new SUPER 2080 is “faster than the Titan XP”. While the numbers might not reflect it, the architecture improvement could deliver similar results.  The RTX 2080 SUPER will go on sale starting July 23.  Nvidia RTX 2070 SUPER   The RTX 2070 SUPER replaces the original RTX 2070, again for the same cost. You can clearly see the changes or more so the bump in specs. The end performance improvement comes in at 24% in some cases and about 16% on average against the normal RTX 2070. Nvidia even went as far as putting it against (actually ahead) of their GTX 1080Ti, now that’s impressive (if it pans out).     FEATURES  RTX 2070  RTX 2070 SUPER      CUDA Cores  2304  2560    Base Clock (MHz)  1410  1605    Boost Clock (MHz)  1620  1770    Tensor Cores  228  320    RT Cores  36  40    Texture Units  144  160    Memory Bandwidth  14Gbps  14Gbps    Total Bandwidth  448GB/s  448GB/s    Memory Bus Width  256-bits  256-bits    GPU Architecture  Turing (TU106)  Turing (TU104)    Render Outputs  64  64    Memory Config  8GB  8GB    TDP  215W  215W    Price  $499  $499     The added 16%-24% performance gain comes in at the exact same TDP. Its performance will also be very comparable to the RTX 2080 and you can clearly see the base and boost clock gains here, so that really doesn’t surprise me much. The RTX 2070 SUPER will be available starting July 9 for $499, which is what the original RTX 2070 currently costs.  Nvidia RTX 2060 Super   So, the RTX 2060 Super is the only card to receive a price bump alongside the regular spec bump. And that’s a bit hard to swallow given its performance bump from  6.5 TFLOPs to 7.2 TFLOPs  at FP32. But Nvidia claims a 15% boost in performance, so basically (almost) up on par with the RTX 2070.     FEATURES  RTX 2060  RTX 2060 SUPER      CUDA Cores  1920  2176    Base Clock (MHz)  1365  1470    Boost Clock (MHz)  1680  1650    Tensor Cores  240  272    RT Cores  30  34    Texture Units  120  136    Memory Bandwidth  14Gbps  14Gbps    Total Bandwidth  336GB/s  448GB/s    Memory Bus Width  192-bits  256-bits    GPU Architecture  Turing (TU106)  Turing (TU106)    Render Outputs  48  64    Memory Config  6GB  8GB    TDP  160W  175W    Price  $349  $399     Here the TDP has increased by about 15W to a max of 175W. Given the specs bump and performance are not bad for a $399 GPU.  Conclusion  Basically, the SUPER moniker is similar to that of the “Ti”. But they made sure none of the SUPER cards outperform their higher tier model. The RTX 2070 Super is super-close to the RTX 2080, but not quite there, and it’s the same for all three of the cards. But in short, all cards received a 10-15% increase in performance. With that out the way, let’s tackle the question of what these new GPUs mean.   The older GPUs will be no more and will be replaced completely by the new SUPER family. And there are a few reasons for this. The current RTX series was getting a bit stale, although exciting at launch, they quickly lost their charm. A significant price drop would have helped, but that isn’t exactly a headliner nor as exciting as a new product launch.  Then there are the new  Navi GPUs . Nvidia has always had a stellar budget offering, and the RTX 2060 SUPER retains the position again. What about the new 2080Ti SUPER? Maybe they are keeping it locked up until AMD’s launch. Waiting for the competition to show their hand first. If AMD comes up with a card that’s as good or better as the RTX 2080Ti, I guess, we will see a Super version of that, too.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nvidia-RTX-2070-Super.jpg']
['Vivo iQOO Neo – A Strange phone with a strange name'],['Vivo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['July 3, 2019']",2019-07-03 10:59:22+00:00,"['Vivo’s IQOO  gaming phone seemed strange already. Even its tagline “Monster Inside” sounded intimidating, and with its software acceleration modes, it was plenty fast, too. A few months later, Vivo has birthed a sibling to that one – the  Vivo IQOO Neo . This one is more affordable than the other one.  Vivo IQOO Overview  This is also a gaming smartphone, just more affordable, so, it’s slightly toned-down than the IQOO. It packs a  Snapdragon 845 chipset , which is last years’, but that’s still a powerful chipset. Kinda like the  Pocophone F1 , but with added software mods to make it a gaming phone. And to do that, it has a 6 GB / 8 GB RAM inside with 64 GB / 128 GB storage, too.  Of course, that’s not enough to make it a gaming specialty. It features a  dedicated cooling system inside  – two multilayer graphite slates with a vapor chamber and an aluminum piece in between. With this kind of cooling, the company claims it will stay at 3-degree Celsius lower temperatures than the current SD 845 smartphones.         In addition, following the current gaming trend in China, the Vivo IQOO Neo has plenty of gaming features. It comes with AI Turbo, Center Turbo, Net Turbo, Cooling Turbo, and other features under the  Multi-Turbo  heading. Furthermore, the display even packs something called the  Touch Acceleration  for digitizer, so that there will be zero lags while using in-game controls/joysticks.  As for the other aspects, it has a  6.38″ OLED panel  with Full HD+ resolution, and it comes with an  in-display fingerprint scanner . It sports a  triple camera setup , comprising of 12 MP primary lens, 8 MP wide-angle lens, and a 2 MP depth sensor. Also, the selfie camera is a 12 MP sensor as well. In addition to that, the phone has a large  4500 mAh battery  with  22.5-Watt Fast Charging . Software-wise, it runs on FunTouch OS 9 based on Android Pie.  Vivo IQOO Specifications:   Display : 6.38-inch Super AMOLED  Resolution : Full-HD+ (2340 × 1080 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio @404PPI pixel density  Chipset : Snapdragon 845; 10nm Mobile Platform  CPU : Octa-core (4×2.8 GHz Kryo 385 Gold & 4×1.7 GHz Kryo 385 Silver)  GPU : Adreno 630  RAM : 6GB/8GB  Storage : 64/128GB; No SD card slot for memory expansion  Software & UI : Android 9.0 (Pie) with FunTouch OS 9  Rear Camera : Triple Camera setup – (12MP primary camera, f/1.8 aperture, PDAF) + (8MP, f/2.2 ultra-wide-angle) + (2MP depth sensor), LED flash  Front Camera : 12MP, f/2.0  Sensors : Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery : 4500mAh battery with 22.5-watt fast charging   Price and Availability  Right now, the phone is only launched in China. Pricing starts from  CNY 1798  (~$260) for the 6/64 GB variant and goes up to  CNY 2298 (~335) for the 8 GB variant. It is available in two colors: Black and Purple.  With such a strange name, do you think a phone such as this can go against the likes of  Xiaomi Black Shark 2 , or the  Razer Phone 2 ? However, even if this is only available in China, you might be able to order it online via Vivo’s own online store and major Chinese retailers.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vivo-iqoo-neo.jpg']
['Vivo’s S-series coming soon to compete in the mid-range segment'],['Vivo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['July 3, 2019']",2019-07-03 10:49:19+00:00,"['Vivo, currently, has two very popular smartphone lineups, their Y-series, which comprise of budget phones, and their V-series, which are premium mid-rangers. Of course, they have the X-series and the Nex too, but they’re not for all market segments. It’s only their Y-series and V-series that are globally available. And due to this, Vivo doesn’t really play in the mid-range segment. However, that’s about to change with Vivo S-series.  Vivo’s coming out with an S-series smartphone lineup. Well, they do have an S-series, but that’s only limited to China. And even so, that’s their rebrands of the  Vivo V15  and  V15 Pro  as the S1 and S1 Pro. So, it’s clear that the company will come up with new phones in this lineup for international markets. But the phones are still under wraps, and even the names are not disclosed yet.         \xa0  Only very few details have surfaced regarding the S-series. For the first iteration of the devices, there are rumors that the first Vivo S phone will be arriving in two models. One of these models will have  6 GB RAM  while the other will have  8 GB RAM . Both of them will feature a  128 GB storage , though. These models will be mainly focusing on the design and style aspects besides just specifications, and will also feature triple camera setups.  This strategy comes from Vivo to compete with mid-range phones from brands like Xiaomi’s Note-series, Realme, and Samsung’s Galaxy A-series. Also, the price of the S-series will be between  INR. 20000 – 25000  in India. These will be offline-exclusive in the country.   For their online-exclusive market, Vivo’s also launching their Z-series in India. But the Z-series is not a new lineup. We already have the  Z1 Pro  which is available in India. Also, there are phones like  Vivo Z5x  in the Z-series. But since it’s an online exclusive brand, it might not make its way to Nepal.  However, the S-series will also make its way to Nepal very soon, after the Indian launch. And judging by the Indian prices, their prices will probably be along  Rs.30000 – 40000 , which is the typical mid-range price in Nepal. So, I guess, we’ll have more options in the mid-range smartphone segment in Nepal in the near future. Is that a good thing or bad? Do let us know.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vivo-s1-pro.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy Note 10 will launch at Unpacked event on August 7'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['July 2, 2019']",2019-07-02 07:18:39+00:00,"['Samsung’s flagships encompass their S-series and Note devices. Since the company has already released its  Galaxy S10 devices  this year, now it’s time for the Note series to make its way to the smartphone world. And Samsung recently announced the date, time, and venue on which it will launch its Galaxy Note 10 devices.  The South Korean company made it clear that the Note 10 devices will launch on August 7 this year. And this second Unpacked event of the year will be happening in Brooklyn at the Barclays Center. It’s the same venue, which Samsung chose to unveil the last year’s  Galaxy Note 9 . The launch event is said to take place at 4 PM EDT on New York (1 pm PDT, 9 pm BST, 6 am AEST in Australia).  The announcement for the launch event basically came through an image. The image shows a Stylus (or S-pen) with a circular camera right beneath it. You could say that this bears resemblance to an exclamation mark. So, is Samsung inferring that the device will bring jaw-dropping surprises? We don’t know that yet, but a new Note 10 device should be exciting enough. And since it’s Samsung, who knows?         What to expect on Samsung Galaxy Note 10 unpacked event?  There’s a trend of launching multiple flagship devices in a single unveiling event. OnePlus bringing 7 and 7 Pro and Samsung’s S10, S10 Plus, S10e, and S10 5G in the single event is an example. And since Samsung has already tried this maverick approach, we can be sure that the company will do the same. After all, there are multiple variants of the Note 10 devices too, at least, according to rumors. According to speculations, there will be two Note 10 devices. One the normal size variant, which is said to come with a 6.25-inch display and another with an extra-large 6.75-inch screen. The bigger one is said to bear Samsung  Galaxy Note 10+  moniker. Also, these speculations suggest both of these devices will come in normal and 5G variants. And that makes a total of four Note 10 devices.  Breaking down the launch event teaser, we can expect something significant on the Stylus and the front camera. And there are two things we can presume: one, that the front camera is on the stylus, which has been in the talks for some time now. And another would be a punched-hole cutout for the selfie snapper, which, this time, could be aligned in the center. Either of these is possible but Samsung could probably go the second route.  Since there is just a single camera shown in the image, Samsung will probably ditch the secondary shooter on the front, which was present on the Galaxy S10 Plus.  Apart from that, there are also rumors circling that Samsung will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack on these models. Since Samsung has done that on its midrange devices like the  Galaxy A80  and  M40 , that may not come much of a surprise.  Furthermore, Samsung can also use the stage to announce its  indefinitely delayed Galaxy Fold device . Samsung co-CEO DJ Koh said that they had pushed the product to the market before it was ready. So they are probably making the amendments to relaunch the device in full circle in this Unpacked event.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review.jpg']
['MSI GL63 9RDS Review: A Powerful Laptop with a Bottleneck!'],"['MSI', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['July 1, 2019']",2019-07-01 11:15:37+00:00,"['When you think MSI, you mostly imagine high-end specs and the most powerful of gaming laptops. But, MSI also makes gaming laptops with modest specs targeted towards budget buyers. It’s their GL-series that comprise of such machines. And the latest addition to the GL-series is the  MSI GL63 9RDS . Yes, that is a mouthful, but this laptop is not widely available. It is limited to some regions, only. However, this is available in Nepal, for a price of  Rs.145,000 , which is probably equal to some $900 to $1000. And is it worth this price? Find out in this MSI GL63 9RDS review.  MSI GL63 9RDS Specifications:   Processor : Hexa-core Intel 9th Gen i7-9750H,\xa0 2.6 GHz-4.5 GHz  Display : 15.6″ Full HD (1920 x 1080), 60Hz, TN LCD panel  GPU : Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 4 GB VRAM, GDDR5  RAM : 8 GB DDR4 @ 2666 MHz (Max 32 GB), Dual-slot  Storage : 1TB HDD + 128 GB PCIe Gen-3 NVMe SSD  Ports : 1 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, 3 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A, SDcard slot, 1x HDMI, 1x RJ-45 Ethernet, 1x MiniDisplay display port, Audio-in, Audio-out  Connectivity : Gigabit LAN + Killer Wireless-AC AC 9462 + Bluetooth 5  Keyboard : Full-Size SteelSeries Red-Backlit Keyboard  Webcam : High Definition 720p Camera  Speakers : Dynaudio 2 x 3W Speakers, Nahimic 3 Nahimic 3, Hi-Res Audio  Battery : 6 Cell battery 41 Watt-hour  OS : Windows 10 Home  Price: Rs 145,000 (Rs. 135,000 on offer)    Buy HERE  Performance  I can’t exactly call it a strictly budget gaming laptop, but you can’t really get a lot of budget gaming laptops in this price. And for this price for a MSI laptop, there are bound to be some compromises. You’re not wrong, really. It actually features the latest  9th-gen i7-9750H processor , which is fantastic! To pack such a processor for the price is simply great. But the compromise lies in the graphics department. Because, what you get is the modest  GTX 1050 Ti  in it.         And that is a kind of a bottleneck on its part because while the laptop is capable of running processor intensive apps like Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom, and such, without many hiccups, gaming takes a hit. The GTX 1050 Ti might have been a middle of the line graphic card back in 2018, but right now, it’s outdated, and even though you will be able to play most games on it, you’ll have to do so in the modest settings.  Games like Battlefield V was playable in Medium settings and gave me about 40 – 50 frames per second on average. While the game is playable, that’s all we can expect from the 1050 Ti, As for Apex Legends, it was playable in Medium settings in the same frame rates of 40-50. So, you have to stick to games like CS:GO to get frame rates over 100 in High Settings.  And here, the GPU is clearly the bottleneck because while gaming, the GPU is running at max, while the CPU is barely at around 20%. So, this gaming laptop actually does other things better than gaming, which is odd, but given the choice of GPU, it is to be expected.  Thermals  But the choice of GPU also means very less pressure on the CPU. And that means less heating up. Because even during long hours of gaming, the MSI GL63 9RDS didn’t really heat up that much. It could have been the fairly low usage of CPU compared to the GPU, but safe to say, you’ll rarely get heating problems. I never had to turn on the Cooler Boost on during my usage. However, even without the heating, long hours can stress out the GPU, and you might face some throttling.  So, this laptop is more of a heavy workhorse than a gaming rig. You could do video editing and content creating, but that is again, limited by the choice of the display panel.  Display  What the MSI GL63 9RDS packs is a  15.6″ Full HD display , with a  TN LCD panel.  And that makes for not-so-good viewing angles, and average color distribution and accuracy. So, the screen is another bottleneck for content creation.   However, the screen is more than enough for gaming, or regular media consumption. Besides the viewing angles, other aspects of the display are fairly good. The brightness is there, and it can make your movies and pictures look good. Also, the screen has considerable bezels around the sides, but that’s okay because so does every other gaming laptop around this price category.  Design  As for the design, the MSI GL63 9RDS follows your typical budget gaming laptop design, which is very similar to the  MSI GL63 8SE . It is big, kinda bulky and the build is plastic. With that build, the weight is at  2.2 kg , which feels like the standard weight for a gaming laptop of this caliber and build. The top lid has a smooth  matte finish , but this one attracts fewer fingerprints, and even then, the finger smudges are not clearly visible.   Rest of the design footprint is still the old classic MSI. You have two air vents at the back and both sides of the body. The lid has two red strips, which do not glow, and the MSI Dragon shield which glows when turned on – nothing new. And even inside, the design remains unchanged. You get the standard keyboard layout with extra keys on top for the cooler boost fans and the Dragon center.      MSI GL63 9RDS Design   1  of 3               Back panel         Webcam         Vents                     Even with a plastic build, there is very less flex on the keyboard deck and surrounding areas, but the lid does flex quite a bit. Maybe it is prone to some durability issues, especially on the lid. And another thing is, you can’t open the laptop single-handedly, which is important very some. So, this is something that gives a gaming vibe but doesn’t scream gaming like others. And there’s nothing fantastic about it either. This just seems like an old MSI laptop with a new processor.  Ports and Speakers  But MSI’s gaming laptops come with a great selection of ports. You get plenty of them –  three USB As , a  USB-C (without Thunderbolt 3) , a  MiniDisplay port , an  Ethernet port , an  HDMI , an  audio-in  and  audio-out , and  an SD Card slot .      MSI GL63 9RDS Ports   1  of 2               Right         Left                  Another good thing about this laptop is the loudspeakers.  MSI’s Giant Speakers  make their presence here as well, and the giant speakers are plenty loud. Even with the fans running on full throttle, you can hear your music videos or game sounds. But these loudspeakers are prone to some distortion in very high volumes.  Keyboard and Trackpad   Moving on to the keyboard, the MSI GL63 9RDS packs a  SteelSeries keyboard , so, you know what to expect. But MSI’s budget gaming laptops don’t get the full RGB individual key backlighting treatment. You only get  Red backlighting , 4 levels of it, actually, and there are no programming individual keyboards, either.   But, still, SteelSeries keyboard is still one of the good ones out there. The keys are soft but provide good tactile feedback. There’s a right amount of mushiness to it and ample key travel. Overall, typing experience and gaming are good enough, though not as good as on higher-end MSI gaming laptops.   However, you can’t say the same for the trackpad. Not the worst trackpad I’ve ever used, but this is a serious compromise on MSI’s part. Tracking is okay, but sometimes, can take a lot of effort. Scrolling with it is a pain in the neck, and gestures are a hit or miss. Sometimes they work, and sometimes, it takes some more coercion.\xa0 So, do yourselves a favor, and use an external mouse.  Memory and Storage  In terms of memory, there’s  8 GB of RAM , but only in a single channel. 8 GB is enough for the most part, given the kind of gaming you’ll be able to do on it, but if you want to upgrade, you do have a second slot, though. So, if you put another 8 GB stick in there, that dual channel memory might improve the performance even further.   As for the storage, you get a  128 GB NVMe PCIe Gen 3 SSD , and a  1 TB hard drive .\xa0 The SSD is pretty fast as well, giving close to  1500 MBPS of read speeds , and about  400 MBPS of write . It’s not the fastest, but more than enough. Of course, the 128 GB might not be enough, so, you have to stick to having only Windows and the most important of software in there. For the rest of it, you get 1 TB Hard Drive, so, there are no problems regarding the storage here.  Battery  Batteries are not the strong suit of gaming laptops, and it’s the same with this MSI GL63 9RDS, too. You get a small  41 Watt-hour battery  which will last you like  2.5 hours  on normal usage, but maybe close to an hour for gaming. So, you’ll have to carry your charger around if you’re taking it places.  Conclusion & Verdict  The MSI GL63 9RDS, to me, looks like a strange combination of parts. It is targeted as a gaming laptop, and they certainly did include the processor for it. But they compromised major on the graphics card, which actually bottlenecks even the CPU in terms of gaming.  And if the aspects like the display were better, you could turn it into a content creator’s laptop, too. However, the screen is not good enough for that. So, what this laptop essentially is, is a workhorse on the most part for those who need to do some heavy lifting like MATLAB or a lot of programming, or 3D modeling and stuff, with some occasional gaming in there.  Honestly, for a price of  Rs.145,000  in Nepal, I applaud the choice of CPU, but I would’ve been happier with an 8 th  gen processor with a better graphics card, at least an RTX 2060, or maybe a GTX 1070, even. So, this is not your mainstream gaming laptop, but a quite powerful one.  MSI GL63 9RDS Pros & Cons  Pros:   Powerful processor  Good keyboard  Great Thermals  Good price to performance ratio   Cons:   Outdated graphics card  Less-than-average display  Trackpad']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/msi-gl63-9rds-review.jpg']

['Huawei Trade Ban Lifted: Can continue business with US companies'],['Huawei'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 30, 2019']",2019-06-30 12:42:19+00:00,"['The recent  Huawei ban  has certainly created chaos in the tech industry. It also generated a feeling of insecurity among the Huawei and Honor smartphone users. But the ban didn’t last long. The US president, Donald Trump, finally lifted up the ban and opened the doors for US companies to sell their products to the Chinese tech firm.  A few weeks earlier, the US government had enlisted the Chinese tech company and 70 of its associates in the “Entity list”. Back then, the Chinese tech firm was referred to as a “threat to national security”. The government also prohibited US companies to sell any of their products to Huawei. But in the sidelines of G20 summit, Trump seems to have got little softer on the matter and abruptly lifted up the ban.  But there are many, who believe this as a part of the trade deal with China. A report from the Wall Street Journal also suggests that Chinese President Xi Jinping insisted that lifting the Huawei trade ban would be an integral component in any trade agreement with the US.        There was also the news about the US companies like Intel and Xilinx lobbying the US government to lift the ban imposed on Huawei. There are reports that the US chipmakers like Intel, Qualcomm, and Micron having earned a total of $11 billion with the business with Huawei. And that may have to some extent made the president go easy on Huawei.  The US president uplifted the trade barrier for the Chinese company and gave the following statement to put a light on the matter.  \xa0“One of the things I will allow, however, is, a lot of people are surprised we send and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make.  “And I said that that’s okay, that we will keep selling that product. These are American companies… that make product and that’s very complex, by the way, and highly scientific.  “And in some cases, we’re the ones that do it, we’re the only ones that do it. What we’ve done in Silicon Valley is incredible, actually and nobody has been able to compete with it, and I’ve agreed and pretty easily, I’ve agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product.  “So American companies will continue and they were having a problem, the companies were not exactly happy that they couldn’t sell because they had nothing to do with whatever it was potentially happening with respect to Huawei, so I did do that.”  This means that Huawei could now purchase products from US companies. Any previous lockouts from Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Google will also be abruptly resolved. But the US government has not yet removed Huawei from its “Entity list” yet. So, we are not quite sure if the US government can revert back its decision and impose a ban again.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/huawei-ban-5g-e1561898026254.jpg']
['Shatterproof glass: A solution for foldable phones?'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 30, 2019']",2019-06-30 11:50:34+00:00,"['Modern day smartphones are absolutely feature-rich. Not to mention their displays. Smartphone displays, too are turning into something else…until they shatter, sometimes. And since they’re packing stuff like AMOLED, and in-display fingerprint scanners, replacing them can be expensive…which is frustrating, too. But, a group of scientists seems to have found a solution to this. According to reports, researchers from  McGill University  have developed a new kind of shatterproof glass.  What is it?  The inspiration behind this the flexible properties of seashells, according to the scientists. “ If you crack open an oyster, you will see the inside shimmering in a rainbow of colors. The smooth substance inside, called the ‘ Mother of Pearl ’, was the inspiration behind the shatterproof glass” , they explained.  It can bend like plastic. However, it will be capable to withstand shocks and external stresses. With these kinds of properties, the glass is also applicable in creating safer windows and strong windshields on automobiles. But after the recent Samsung Galaxy Fold debacle, researchers also think smartphones can make use of this technology on smartphones, especially, the new foldable ones.        How does it get its strength?  The  M other of Pearl  inside the seashells is made up of brittle  C alcium Carbonate . But the Calcium Carbonate is arranged in tiny hexagonal platelets joined by flexible biopolymers. So, they are tough and strong. When the material goes through some impact, the platelets slide over each other as the polymers stretch. So instead of shattering, the energy during the impact dissipates. In case of extreme forces, the platelets can completely deform and rip apart but cracks don’t spread like that on a typical glass panel. It also claims to be three times stronger than Tempered Glass and up to 24 times than your regular glass.   The material also features some notable properties of glass, like, being highly transparent and scratch resistant. But unlike the glasses, it has high resistant to impacts as well. So, we can expect it to replace the conventional glass.  This kind of glass is also cheap to produce, according to Francois Barthelat, a mechanical engineer at McGill University. So that it can even be used on the mainstream smartphone and upcoming foldable phones. If this turns out good, it can even supersede the popular  Gorilla glasses .']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Scientists-created-shatterproof-glass.jpg']
['North Korea’s own smartphone: Typically North Korean'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 30, 2019']",2019-06-30 09:30:36+00:00,"['North Korea is a country that needs no introduction…or a lot of it, depending on how you see it. It’s a highly secluded country and believes in self-reliance. And that’s probably all the info available about the country ruled by dictatorship. And in a bid to remain more secluded (or protect its privacy, in their words), their home-brand Pyongyang launched a new smartphone in the country. Dubbed  Pyongyang 2425 , it’s typically North Korean – runs only government-approved apps, and restricts all the rest.  Pyongyang 2425 Overview  The Pyongyang 2425 is the successor of the Pyongyang 2423. No, the names are very strange, and we don’t know if we can compare it to anything. But, it claims to bring a substantial upgrade over its predecessor. This new smartphone features a powerful octa-core processor onboard. And the company officials say the new CPU boosts the  processing speeds by 150% ! Also, the touchscreen experience is better. Of course, this is all the company’s word itself, and we don’t really know. We’ll just have to take their word for it.  As for the aesthetics, the phone features a  6.2-inch screen with Full-HD+  (1080 x 2246 pixels) resolution. However, the  type of display panel  is not revealed. But, the display also comes with an iPhone-like wide notch on top. And the notch houses an IR scanner along with the selfie camera and other sensors. This means that there is 3D Facial mapping, enabling it to use Face Unlock even in the dark. However, there is also a fingerprint scanner at the back.        Company officials say, “Face recognition through infrared technology means you don’t need fingerprints or a password and can easily get past the lock screen even in dark environments”. \xa0 And I was like… “Yeah…that’s the whole point of an IR Scanner!”  In terms of software, the Pyongyang 2425 runs on Android 8.1 Oreo. Yes, it’s old for us, but we don’t know what goes on in there. But experts say that North Korea might have ordered production with the mutual understanding that they’d replace the software later on. So, there should be a customized UI or an entirely new OS when it starts shipping. And we wouldn’t expect any less from the North Korean government.  The battery on the device is a  3050 mAh battery , with wireless charging support. But as far as the cameras are concerned, its hardware information is still under cover. But to no one’s surprise, the company claims high-res camera sensors.  The phone has Wi-Fi connectivity features, too. Yes, we take that for granted, but its a different story there. It is designed not to connect to foreign Wi-Fi networks! But it does have this “Wi-Fi SIM” card, which allows its users to use Wi-Fi services available within the nation. A user reported using it to view and save science and technology related materials from any location”. And according to him, it was like a “Mirae (future) public free wireless data network”. And this is something that was promoted only last year in the country’s  National Exhibition of IT Successes .   Of course, there have to be some typically North Korean characteristics. And owing to security concerns, the phones don’t even allow their users to open pre-installed photos and ringtones. Also, it will only run government approved apps. Images that surfaced show dictionaries and other learning programs in multiple languages. Anti-theft security apps like  Gold Bell 1.0 ,  Kwangmyong Encyclopedia , an  Office Management Apps  and a  Weather App 2.0  were also visible on the image.   This device comes in a bigger than normal smartphone package but packs the same components. It packs a clear silicone case, headphones, a USB Charger, a wireless charging dock, and a USB Type-C to 3.5 mm headphone adapter. Which means, that the phone does sport a 3.5 mm headphone jack.   If we look at the whole thing, it looks like a premium phone, especially, due to its packaging. However, the price is also in the dark. And although the phone is North Korean, there are rumors about it being made in China!

['Honor 20 Lite Review: The Attractive Mid-ranger'],"['Honor', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 29, 2019']",2019-06-29 06:51:59+00:00,"['When Honor announced the  Honor 20 series smartphones  in London, the Honor 20 and 20 Pro had been the talk of the town for days. Their punch-hole display, flagship-grade processor, and quad-rear cameras were enough to impress many. The cheaper Honor 20 Lite, however, didn’t receive much attention then. So, was it an underdog ignored by many or is it not worth the hype? Let’s find that out in this Honor 20 Lite review!   Honor 20 Lite Specifications:   Display : 6.21-inches LTPS IPS LCD, Full HD+, 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Chipset : HiSilicon Kirin 710  CPU:  Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU : Mali-G51 MP4  OS : Android 9.0 Pie with EMUI 9 on top  RAM : 4 GB  Storage : 128 GB, expandable  Rear camera : Triple – 24 MP, f/1.8 (primary) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultra-wide) + 2 MP, f/2.4 (depth)  Front Camera : 32 MP, f/2.0  Battery : 3,400 mAh non-removable Li-Po battery  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), Accelerometer, Proximity, and Compass  Price:\xa0 Rs.32,500   Design  Like with the previous Honor smartphones, the 20 lite features a gradient color back. The one I have right now is a phantom red color which looks pleasing. One thing you need to know is the back is made of plastic, and not glass which is the reason it feels light on hands.         Other than that, I am pretty happy with its form factor. It rightly fits on my hand and has an even weight distribution. Even the buttons are tactile and placed at a reachable position. So, I have nothing much to complain on the design front.  Display  Talking about the display, this phone retains a 6.21-inch IPS panel, which comes with narrow bezels with a U-shaped tiny notch on the top. Even the chin is thin here. Thinner than most of its competitors out there, I would add. While placing it alongside the Galaxy A50, you can easily notice the difference.   However, gone is the notification LED, which is close to extinction on smartphones these days.  Continuing with the display, the screen here comes with Full-HD resolution on board. So, while viewing the contents, the screen looks sharp as expected. The colors also look quite pleasant here. It’s not quite on the level of the OLED panels but still looks noteworthy among the mid-rangers. And side by side with the A50, I prefer the display on the A50.  Camera  Now let’s head on to the cameras. Like with every other midrange phone out there, this too has three cameras at the back. There’s a 24MP primary lens, which comes alongside an 8MP ultra-wide-angle shooter and a 2MP depth sensor. And all of these cameras are said to be AI-powered.   Talking about the photos from the 24MP camera, I am fairly satisfied with the shots it captures. The images pack quite a lot of details so they look sufficiently sharp. But sometimes, the images are overexposed. I also noticed the phone over-processing the images, due to which, the colors were unnatural at times.        1  of 9                                                                                                            Switching to the wide angle, you can extend the field of view up to 120-degrees. The images, as you can see here, look decent. But it lacks the details. And While comparing it with the Galaxy A50, I noticed a larger field of view and better details in the shots from A50. But what I really liked about the Honor 20 Lite was that the colors in the images didn’t shift while switching into wide-angle mode from normal mode, which happens extensively on the A50.      Normal Vs Wide-angle Mode   1  of 12               Normal Mode         Wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide-angle Mode                                                The third 2MP lens gathers the depth information while taking portrait images. And portrait images look okay at best. There is edge-detection issue on most of the portrait images and the blurring does not look natural. Maybe Honor will fix that in its software update. But until that happens, you have to live with this.        1  of 7                                                                                        Night Mode feature is also getting popular these days. And to address that, Honor has also included a Night Mode feature on this device. With this mode, the camera decreases the shutter speed to 4 to 6 seconds and captures a long exposure shot. And while capturing the low light images using this feature, the subject brightens up quite a bit and there seem to have a little more detail in it. So, to me, it has come in quite handy while taking snaps in the low-lit scenarios.      Normal Vs Night Mode   1  of 8               Normal Mode         Night Mode         Normal Mode         Night Mode         Normal Mode         Night Mode         Normal Mode         Night Mode                                    Apart from that, you get tons of features like Slo-mo, Timelapse, and AR if you do some digging in.   Talking about the selfies, the 32MP doesn’t disappoint. It captures amazing selfies with great facial details. But the phone tends to overdo with the skin, which looks quite unnatural at times. But most of the times they look fairly good. Although the portrait images are due to software processing, they do look good enough. But if you care about edge-detection, it’s still not perfect in that respect but usable most of the times. The portrait mode is also playful here as you can get various portrait lighting effects.        1  of 8               Normal Selfie         Normal Selfie         Normal Selfie                Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Normal Selfie                                    For high res images,  click here .  Performance  Now on to the performance, you get the Kirin 710 Chipset which we have seen on so many Huawei and Honor phones in the last 6 months or so. The Kirin 710 is a decent processor, comparable with the Snapdragon 660, but over the course of 6 months, midrange SoCs from Qualcomm are getting better. You get Snapdragon 675 on Redmi Note 7 Pro and Realme 3 Pro at more or less similar pricing.  I am not bashing Honor and the Kirin 710 chipset but I guess it’s reasonable to demand an upgrade while going from its predecessor Honor 10 Lite.  The Kirin 710 is not a bad processor, it’s actually a decent performer and can handle most people’s day-to-day tasks pretty easily. Multitasking is also fairly good with 4GB of RAM onboard.  But it’s the gaming part that Kirin 710 lags behind the competition. On my test, Heavy games did not run quite smoothly on the highest of the settings. PUBG is playable at medium settings by default, which wasn’t smooth the way I expected. So, if you are into gaming, you should opt for the Snapdragon 675 powered phones. There’s  Pocophone F1  with Snapdragon 845 which is still available, you can get that too.  Talking about the storage, you get a base variant of 128GB, which should suffice the needs of many. And this is where Honor 20 Lite stands out against the rest. Because, every phone at this price, will have 64GB storage. Plus, there is an SD card slot as well if you wish to expand it even further.  Software  The phone runs on Android 9 Pie with the custom skin EMUI 9.0.1 on the top. And with Huawei’s UI, you do get a ton of bloatware and a number of redundant apps. Nonetheless, you can uninstall the majority of them.  But apart from that, the UI is pretty much likable. It’s well-optimized and navigating through the UI is also pretty smooth. On top of that, most of the settings are customizable. So, you can easily tune it into your liking.        1  of 3               Multitasking          Notification Panel         UI                     But what’s concerning here is the software update. Huawei has been enlisted in the US government’s entity list. And Honor being the sub-brand of Huawei, we don’t have any option but to wait and see what happens next.  Battery  Now let’s talk about the battery. The phone comes with a 3400mAh battery, which sounds quite underwhelming. However, EMUI optimization is great, so I got around 6 hours of on-screen time.\xa0 Also, the screen on time is based on my heavy usage that includes two hours of social media, two hours of watching videos and an hour of gaming.   The phone comes with 10-watt charger out of the box, which uses Micro USB port to charge up the phone. While using the stock charger, it took exactly 1 hour and 56 minutes to get the device fully charged. I even tried to charge the device with an 18-watt charger. But there wasn’t still an improvement in the charging pace. So, there is that!  Extras:  Like all the Huawei and Honor phones, the fingerprint sensor on this device is fast and accurate. It accurately detected my fingerprints 9 out of 10 times, except for times when you have wet or greasy hands. Face unlock is fast too and is done via the front camera. About the Wi-Fi though, it does not have Wi-Fi ac, so you won’t be able to connect to a 5GHz network, which if I remember correctly, was missing on  Huawei’s Nova 3i  as well. Other things like audio quality is fairly loud and call quality is good too.  Conclusion  The Honor 20 Lite is a fairly good performer for the price being asked. There is nothing that bugs me about the phone, everything is okay, except for the fact that the performance could have been a little better. And even inclusion of a faster-charging feature and a type-C port would have given this device a little edge over the others.   Also, you do have plenty of options to go for, like the  Galaxy A50  or the  Pocophone F1  or the  Galaxy M40 . And since the  Redmi Note 7 Pro  is also launching in Nepal really soon, you have even more options. So, in the end, I will leave the choice up to you guys.  Pros and Cons  Pros:   Good design  Ample 128GB storage  Has dedicated Night Mode   Cons:   Micro USB Port in 2019  No Fast charging  No upgrade on performance from its predecessor']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/honor-20-lite-review.jpg']

In the early days, the speed of  such scanners  used to be as slow as a slug. But over time, the technology is catching up the speed and is comparable with the conventional scanners these days. The feature also looks quite fancy among smartphones. However, the technology was limited to OLED panels so far. Since OLED panels are thinner and allow light to pass through them, they were easily the favorites. However, OLED panels are also expensive at the same time. And with fingerprint scanners embedded to the display, smartphones used to cost a fortune. But that’s going to change. Chinese display manufacturer BOE and AUO Optronics recently announced that they successfully implemented an optical in-display fingerprint scanner on a conventional LCD panel.  As reported by DigiTimes, out of 1.456 billion smartphones shipped worldwide in 2018, 85 percent of them had LCD displays. Since LCD panels are cost-effective and easy to manufacture, smartphone companies usually include these types of panels on the midrange and budget phones. So if these sort of LCD panels with in-display fingerprint scanners start coming, we may start seeing this fancy piece of tech even on the mainstream budget phones.  And that may not take too long. BOE promises to start the mass production of such kind of displays by the end of 2019. So, if everything runs on schedule and if everything goes well, we might see the tech making its way to affordable phones since the beginning of 2020.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/LCD-panels-with-in-display-fingerprint-scanners.jpg']
['OPPO unveils under-display selfie camera at MWC Shanghai 2019'],['OPPO'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 27, 2019']",2019-06-27 13:31:50+00:00,"['All screen phones are considered Holy Grail in the smartphone industry. And in the pursuit of pushing the screen to body ratio, smartphone makers are chopping off the bezels as much as they can. In that run, we saw smartphones with notched display, which has shrunk down to the shape of a water drop in the recent days. Concurrently, companies were also implementing pop-up style selfie cameras. Since such mechanical parts can arise complications over time and durability is also quite a concern, Such design didn’t actually turn out as an optimal solution. But what Oppo showcased in the MWC Shanghai 2019 is, in fact, the solution everyone was looking for. To bid farewell to the bezels and to get rid of the elevating mechanism, Oppo showcased an under-display selfie camera, which seamlessly blends into the display.  Earlier this month, the selfie expert had teased the product. But this time around, Oppo divulged more information about the technology to the general audience.   OPPO’s brand new solution for full-screen display – Under-screen Camera (USC) has just been unveiled here at  #MWC19  Shanghai!  #MoreThanTheSeen   pic.twitter.com/k5qEQ3QNta  — OPPO India (@oppomobileindia)  26 June 2019         Oppo India’s official Twitter handle also posted about the product. The video shows the selfie camera being perfectly blended into the screen when the camera is idle. However, while looking up close, the area about the camera looks somewhat pixelated. According to Oppo, that pixelated or zoned-out area of the screen uses a highly transparent material plus a redesigned pixel structure to let the light pass easily through it. Oppo claims that even the conventional displays, which are compatible with in-display fingerprint scanners are still not good enough for the under-display selfie camera. So the company developed a new type of display with transparency properties such that the camera conceals easily under the display.   Oppo is also flaunting about the size of the sensor used in its under-display selfie camera module. It’s said to be larger with bigger pixels than all the selfie cameras out there. On top of that, Oppo has also incorporated a wider aperture to let in more light into the sensor. Despite the large sensor and wider aperture, the upper portion of the screen still works with touch control. Oppo has also assured that there won’t be any sorts of compromises on the display quality.  Putting the screen on top of cameras is definitely going to have some implications like hazy photos, glares, colorcast, and reduced image quality. To overcome some issues, Oppo says it has developed algorithms that are tuned to the hardware in order to address these issues. The company has also assured the quality would be on par with the mainstream devices. But it’s yet to be seen. And we might only be able to see that when the device makes it to the commercial market. But when the company is releasing the device we don’t know yet. Oppo says it plans to launch a device with an under-screen camera “in the near future”.  The company had also showcased the  Oppo Reno 10X Zoom  at the trade show and released the commercial product shortly after. So we can expect it to be a similar case on this one.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oppo-under-display-selfie-camera.jpg']

From introducing the world’s first pop-up cameras to making debuting in-display fingerprint sensors in mid-range phones, Vivo likes to bring new things to the table. And in the ongoing MWC (Mobile World Congress) Shanghai, Vivo did the same. The company showcased a lot of things, some of which, are astonishing.  Vivo’s MWC Shanghai 2019 Overview  5G Fest   With advances in the 5G technology going in a rapid pace, Vivo revealed the  world’s first commercial 5G phone . Given that Vivo showed us their concept Nex 5G a while ago, this is not much of a surprise. But still, to know that we finally have a fully commercial 5G smartphone is still great news. The phone will be available in the third quarter of 2019, but that’s all the information about the phone.        In addition to the commercial 5G phone, Vivo also announced its future plans in the 5G era. With a strategy to accelerate its innovations across smart devices and applications for the 5G era, Vivo showcased a  range of 5G applications  including 5G Cloud Game, 5G Screen Mirroring, and 5G EasyShare.  For instance, the 5G Cloud Gaming does not take place on the users phone, but on the cloud via 5G network, thanks to its ultra-speed and super-low latency. With this, users can play high-end games even on mediocre phones. That’s quite something, isn’t it?  Vivo AR   Vivo is also stepping into the AR dimension with its very first AR glasses. And they showcased it as well. Their new Vivo AR Glass supports  dual-screen display  and  6DoF technology . This means that the AR Glass allows you six degrees of freedom (normal ones allow only 3DoF), which refers to the freedom of movement of a rigid body in 3D space. After connecting the AR glasses with 5G, users can experience applications like mobile office, AR Games, 3D HD video, and object recognition.  The Vivo AR Glass will also enable your smartphone to switch roles according to the applications. For example, while gaming, your phone will be the main console whereas, in a mobile office, your smartphone will be the keyboard. Currently, it  supports 5 applications : mobile game, mobile office, 5G theatre, facial recognition, and object recognition.  Vivo Super FlashCharge   Vivo’s Dual Engine Fast Charge is still one of the best Fast Charging standards there is. But, with what they have now, they’ve got all the other competition beat! They did reveal their new industry-leading  Super FlashCharge  already a while back. But they finally revealed this tech fully in the MWC Shnaghai 2019. This Super FlashCharge is a  120 Watt charging standard , that can charge a 4000 mAh battery fully in about 13 minutes! This, truly, is ground-breaking! We don’t know when it’ll see implementation in smartphones, but when they do…well, that’s going to be a new day for smartphones!  So, it seems Vivo is taking major steps towards some serious innovation. Let’s see what difference it makes in the smartphone and tech world.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vivo-mwc-shanghai-2019.png']

For a budget of under Rs. 20000, I couldn’t find something appealing yet equally capable. But, with  Daraz Mobile Week 2019 , I thought I had a chance. After all, it is creating quite a buzz in the market, lately. But my experience with Daraz wasn’t all sunshine on its  11.11 Sales Day . And I was a bit skeptic about this one too. However, with Daraz giving it so much hype, particularly with those 25% discounts on payment with credit/debit cards, I thought, why not? I needed to buy a phone anyway. But as a cynic, I took screenshots of every step I followed while making the purchase. But in the end, it was worth it. Because I bought a Rs. 22,000 phone for only Rs.16000! Here’s how I did it.  I have been an account holder of NIC Asia Bank. And since Daraz was offering a 25% discount up to Rs.5000 for purchases through their debit/credit card, I actually got it activated for online payment. That is the policy in Nepal, so, had to do it. Still, it was worth it. Fortunately, it only took a few minutes. But for those who don’t have a NIC Asia Bank a/c, Siddhartha Bank is also offering the same kind of incentives (25%).  Other banks are also providing discounts like Nabil Bank, Sanima Bank, Standard Charted Bank of various magnitudes. But the best offers are from NIC Asia and Siddhartha Bank, though.        So, after the activation of my card, I opened the Daraz App. I wanted to get the Redmi Note 7, and that was within my budget. And after a quick search, I found the Redmi Note 7 (3 / 32 GB) listed for a price of Rs.21,999. But there was also Rs.1000 worth of discount voucher in there, which I wasn’t aware of. I used that voucher code “ 19MW1000 ” on checkout and grabbed that penny-saving voucher.      Steps to buy from Daraz   1  of 7               Redmi Note 7 Product page         Using Voucher Code         I got Rs. 1,000 discount         Checking Out         Entering the Payment Details         Entering the OTP Code         OTP validated Successfully                                 Then I filled all the necessary details in. And at the time of payment, I chose the payment option as “Debit Card”, after which, a new Window popped up for me to fill in my card details. After the credentials was over, I got an OTP Code on my phone. After entering that, and a successful validation later, I got an extra 5000 discount! Which means, with the voucher earlier, I had the Rs.21999 for Rs.20999. But with the NIC Asia Debit payment, I got the phone for Rs.16,049 (Rs.50 is the shipping charge).  That was my experience with Daraz Mobile Week. But I want to clear something up. Because 25% discount won’t necessarily get you 25% on the cost of the device. You actually get a maximum of Rs. 5000. So, do not get confused on that front. But following similar procedures, you can purchase the Pocophone F1 for Rs. 27,999, Galaxy M40 for Rs. 31, 190, and the Galaxy S10 for Rs. 88,500, and Huawei Nova 4 for Rs. 44,900 as well.  Since the Mobile Week 2019 will last till the 30th June, you still have time if you are interested.

But is it just the triple camera or there’s more to it? Is the triple camera setup in Vivo Y15 still relevant in this price segment?  Vivo Y15 Overview  Display  The Vivo Y15 is not very different from its other siblings. In fact, if you look at the Y17, Y15, and Y12 at once, you might not even know the difference!

Camera  But the most impressive thing about this is the  triple cameras  it packs at the back. Yes, I said the same thing for the Y17, and also for the Y12. But it’s not every day that you get three cameras on a budget phone. The triple camera setup on this one is the same as the other two as well – a  13 MP primary camera , an  8 MP ultra-wide lens  and a  2 MP depth sensor . In addition, there’s a nice  16 MP selfie camera  upfront. And this is the only thing that differentiates it from the other siblings (for the most part). Actually, this is the only part differentiating it from the Y12 – as the Y12 has an 8 MP selfie camera while keeping all other aspects the same.  Performance and Battery  Under the hood, this phone runs on the  Helio P22 chipset , which, of course, is a pretty modest smartphone. And for a budget category phone, this might be okay. Also, there’s a  4 GB RAM  and 64 GB storage. In addition, there’s a huge  5000 mAh battery  in it. And combined with the HD+ screen, the battery should last for over 2 days easily.

First of all, it’s not called the Microsoft Surface Centaurus. But since we have no official name for it yet, the codename “Centaurus” will have to do for now. Whatever the name, though, it’s a new type of surface PC from Microsoft and will get a release date sometime in the first half of 2020.  According to sources (Forbes), this new PC will feature not one, but two 9-inch displays – in the form of a book. Keep in mind these are two separate panels, unlike the  Lenovo’s iteration of a foldable laptop . The display comes in at a 4:3 aspect ratio and will pack a 10nm Lakefield CPU from Intel.  Also Read:  MediaTek Helio P65 chipset unveiled: Brings improved AI & gaming capabilities        The Centaurus will run on ‘Windows Lite’ with native Android apps support. It’s basically a stripped down version of Windows and will seemingly compete with ChromeOS. This version of OS is based on the “Windows Core OS”, which is basically a more efficient version of Windows that targets smaller devices, mostly tablets. So, it won’t give you the full-fledged Windows experience, but it won’t gorge all that power either…  Intel’s Tiger Concept; A dual display laptop  The Android App Support  A Windows device with Android sounds exciting, but this isn’t exactly a new concept. Google tried to push the Android PlayStore to their own ChromeOS a few years back, but fast forward to this day, it hasn’t panned out really well for them. ChromeOS is still nowhere near to competing with any of the major players out there.  For one, Microsoft’s reasoning to support Android Apps on their own tablets is awfully similar to Google’s. But if Google themselves failed to scrape out any success from it, I don’t see the silver lining for them, either. And that’s after they added touch support on multiple ChromeOS devices. So what chance does Microsoft have?  But then again, Google’s implementation wasn’t the best either. The apps were poorly optimized, not to mention buggy and that’s on Google’s own ChromeOS! Compared to them, iPads were far far better, and there was basically no comparing the two.   Just think of how many successful Android tablets are currently there in the market. Sure the whole industry has been a bit stale lately, and yet the iPads are still selling comparatively well. So, if the maker who has the most influence towards the play store could not do enough, what does Microsoft hope to achieve from this?  We don’t know yet, but I do have a theory. All of Google’s implementations were limited to tablet experience – think of it as a Windows laptop, but without the legacy features. If Microsoft can bring even a semi Windows experience with Android app support, that could light a match in this direction.  Also Read:  Raspberry Pi 4 is here with powerful internals: All in the same price  And finally, Microsoft has a good relation with OEMs who manufacture hardware based on Windows. So companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP or Acer should come up with their own versions of this PC as well, a benefit Google didn’t have.

The chipset was a capable performer in the midrange territory back then. However,  Helio P70  chipset failed to bring such kind of upgrades. But to purge for the disappointments it created, MediaTek recently unveiled Helio P65. And this new chip has brought faster CPU cores along with improved AI capabilities.  This time, MediaTek has overhauled the core configuration in the Helio P65. In the Helio P60 and P70, the company used an octa-core model with four Cortex-A73 cores and four Cortex-A53 cores. But this time, MediaTek has implemented octa-core setup with two Cortex-A75 performance cores and six Cortex-A55 power-efficient cores.  According to ARM, the Cortex-A75 offers 22% beefier performance than the A73 whereas the A55 is 18% faster than the A53. This cues that the single core performance of this SoC will be better than P60 & P70 but it will still have lower multi-core performance scores.        Even on the GPU front, the company has made some changes. The Mali-G72 GPU has been replaced with less powerful Mali-G52 cores. So there can be some drop in the 3D performance. However, with the company’s CorePilot resource control system, MediaTek claims to deliver consistent performance while gaming.  Nonetheless, MediaTek toiled harder to improve its imaging prowess. The new chip has support for 48MP Quad Bayer sensors. So the ISP (Image Signal Processor) on the SoC can effectively merge multiple pixels into one to produce sharp and crisp images. The SoC also has support for dual-camera set-up consisting of two 16-megapixel sensors. Furthermore, MediaTek Helio P65 chipset is capable of reducing the Multi-Frame Noises. Other notable inclusions would be its improved depth engine to bring better Bokeh effects.  For better video recording capabilities, MediaTek has included an enhanced Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) for stable videos and Rolling Shutter Compensation (RSC) technology. This new chip also supports video recording at H.265 encoded format. However, it is still incapable of recording 4K movies. Helio P65 can only record 1080p/60 fps movies at maximum.  On the connectivity front, there is quite an upgrade from Bluetooth 4.2 to Bluetooth 5.0. MediaTek has also improved GNSS and positioning engine. So you can now expect a more accurate indoor navigation. However, there is no support for UFS storage, which is quite a bummer in 2019. The chip can only handle eMMC 5.1 storage. There is also no support for dual channel LPDDR4x RAM.  Apart from that, there is nothing much of a change while comparing it with the P60 and P70 chipsets. The same 12nm TSMC manufacturing process would be an example.

['Xiaomi Mi CC9: Rumored Up!'],['Xiaomi'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['June 26, 2019']",2019-06-26 09:29:52+00:00,"['Who doesn’t love rumors? Of upcoming smartphones, that is. And the rumors surrounding Xiaomi’s new smartphone lineup are fascinating, to say the least. Xiaomi is now going to launch its third smartphone in its MI lineup, dubbed CC. Strange name, if you ask me, but that CC stands for a number of things. And the first phone from that lineup will be called the  Xiaomi Mi CC9 , and it will debut with a lighter version, the  Xiaomi Mi CC9e .  This comes after Xiaomi bought another mobile manufacturer, called Meitu last year. So, we were expecting some kind of new smartphones, but an entire lineup? Anyway, the CC9 will be focusing more on the aesthetics and camera aspects. So, needless to say, its target audience are the “cool” and “trendy” youngsters.  The intriguing thing is, while the CC in the name stands for  Colorful and Creative , it can also mean a different number of things. Because even Xiaomi’s official photos teasing the devices show a lot of monikers. For instance, it can be Curious & Creative, Challenge & Carry on, Camera Clicks and so on… The phone is developed by the Chic and Cool 90 team, so, that is another full form in itself.        The Xiaomi CC series will feature two phones when it first comes out on  July 2  – a Xiaomi CC9 and a lighter CC9e.  Xiaomi Mi CC9 and CC9e  One of the strangest names for a smartphone, the Xiaomi Mi CC9 (the ‘9’ stands for 9 years of the company), sounds like a very exciting device if we go by the rumors. Since the primary focus is the aesthetics and camera, maybe the phones won’t be very powerful. But some rumors suggest it might feature the new  Snapdragon 730 chipset . Of course, as far as rumors go, other rumors suggest it will feature the flagship chip,  Snapdragon 855 ! We’re all waiting to see about that. Other specs leaks suggest it will have a  6.39″ Full HD+ display , and a  4000 mAh battery .   However, the sure shot thing is that the CC9 will come with a  motorized flip camera , just like the  ASUS Zenfone 6 . The only difference is it will have triple cameras on it, and since it’s a flip camera, the selfie camera will be the same. The only photos that have leaked of the device are in the Prism White color, which looks very classy and cool! Hey… I got another full form of it! 😛   Anyway, the lighter variant, Xiaomi Mi CC9e will have the standard phone design of 2019. That is a  triple camera setup  at the back and a water-drop notch up front. Also, the camera setup will comprise of a 48 MP primary lens, an 8 MP secondary and a 5 MP tertiary lens. And judging by the current trends, we can be pretty sure the additional lenses are an ultra-wide and a depth sensor. In addition, it will feature a smaller  5.97″ Full-HD+ display , a  Snapdragon 710 chipset , and a  3500 mAh battery .  That is all we know about the phones, so far. The info leaks are pretty tight, and we can’t be sure if all the rumors will hold up. These phones will launch in China, on July 2 first. But there is no word of launch outside China yet.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/xiaomi-cc.jpg']

With 10 iterations of it this year alone, it got quite the popularity. From a budget phone like the  Galaxy A10  to the fancy motorized camera phone like the  Galaxy A80 , the A-series has it all. While we already covered it’s sliding and rotating cameras  here , some new information about the device has surfaced. Here’s what we know so far about the new Samsung Galaxy A90, which could also be a part of the new Galaxy R-series! Wonder what that’s all about…  Samsung Galaxy A90 Rumors  Snapdragon 855  The Galaxy A80 had a  Snapdragon 730   in it, and if you want to build a more powerful phone, where do you go? Flagship standard, of course, So, rumors claim it will get the flagship grade  Snapdragon 855 processor . If this pans out, it could quite be the first non-flagship Samsung phone to feature a flagship chipset. Also, this is a major reason why this has a higher chance of not panning out. Again, Samsung has changed its strategies to drastic extents in its smartphone division this year, so fingers crossed.  Also Read:  Samsung Super Cool Deal: Offers ‘Lowest Price’ on its flagships!        5G  The other part of this story comes in the form of  5G . Yes, this could very well be Samsung’s third (or second, depends on how you look at it) phone to feature the new cellular connectivity. Now, Samsung was rumored to launch an affordable 5G enabled smartphone, and going by the present situation, this could be it. Although calling this affordable is kind of an understatement.  Triple Cameras   Moving on, the Samsung Galaxy A90 gets a total of three cameras. Of course, that’s nothing new at this point of time, and since it will employ the same kind of mechanism as the A80, you can say it will have triple cameras at the front, too. Among the three cameras\xa0 we can either get a  48MP + 12MP + 5MP  combination for the SM-A905 or  48MP + 8MP + 5MP  for the SM-A908. The latter is the 5G version while the former is the regular 4G model.  And yeah…there is something called the  Tilt OIS , which by the looks of it is a form of  Optical Image Stabilization , but for now, we’re as clueless about it as you are.  Finally, here’s a rundown of the rest of the specs. It will get a  6.7-inch  display, most probably a Full-HD but could also be a Quad-HD, as a part of the ongoing trend. There will also be an in-display fingerprint built into it. And that’s all what we know about this phone at present. The phone should be launching soon enough, but until then, it remains as one of the most exciting leaks from Samsung.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-a90.jpg']

So, just like Redmi, it looks like Realme is also setting a foot in the flagship territory.  The 64-megapixel snapper has a large 1/1.72″ sensor which results in 1.6µm pixel images.

['Vivo Y17 Review: Triple Cameras and Big Battery on a Budget'],"['Reviews', 'Vivo']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['June 26, 2019']",2019-06-26 01:28:35+00:00,"['When it comes to the budget segment in smartphones, companies like Xiaomi, Realme, and Samsung are doing really well. And honestly, in the budget segment, Vivo is never the first choice for tech enthusiasts like us. It’s primarily of two reasons: low-res display and low-end processor. So, today I have got the new Vivo phone, the Vivo Y17, and yes it has a low-res display and a low-end processor. But, it does come with triple cameras and a huge battery. So, with these two USPs at the helm, should you really choose the Vivo Y17 over other phones? Let’s find that out in this Vivo Y17 review.   Vivo Y17 Specifications   Display : 6.35″ IPS LCD with HD+ resolution (720 x 1544 pixels), 19.3:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Triple-setup, 13 MP primary with f/2.2 aperture & PDAF + 8 MP ultra-wide with f/2.2 aperture + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : Single, 20 MP with f/2.0 aperture  Processor : MediaTek Helio P35  CPU : Octa-core (4×2.3 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4×1.8 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU : PowerVR GE8320  RAM : 4 GB  OS : Android Pie with FunTouch 9  Storage : 128 GB internal  Battery : 5000 mAh, 18-Watt Fast Charging  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass  Price:  Rs. 25,190 (available for Rs. 23,990)   Design         The first thing you notice on the Y17 is the design. This dark bluish color is something I’m really a fan of, and if you look even closer, you can see the textured finish inside. It’s not as prominent as the textures on other phones, but this design has certainly made the phone shine. And speaking of shine, the golden bordering around the camera bulge really makes the design of this phone stand out from the rest.  However, Vivo has taken the route of a polycarbonate back which was expected from the Y17, because the more expensive sibling, the V15 Pro, doesn’t have a glass body.  Another thing I am not a fan of is this feel on the hand. It’s probably due to the large battery it has inside, but the phone is crude. It feels larger than it is, and maybe Vivo could have polished the phone a little more.  On the right side of the device lie the three buttons, and they are placed ergonomically, the power button is on the middle, and the volume rockers right above it. I did miss the tactility of a metallic frame though, as these plastic buttons feel quite cheap.  On the bottom, it has a little chunk of a chin, as I said before. On the bottom lies a speaker grill, a headphone jack, and a MicroUSB. Come on Vivo, we are in 2019, maybe its time you add in a Type-C port.  Display   The Y17 has one major compromise for the price it has and that’s the display. The display is big with a tiny notch, but it’s only an HD+ resolution. This yields in a very low pixel density of 268 PPI. And if you are someone coming from FullHD display, you will be disappointed while watching Videos. You will feel the lack of sharpness right away.  But if you are someone coming from HD display, well, you might not feel that much of a difference, because the colors on this one are actually good. But again, if you are paying upwards of $200, you should be expecting a full HD display.  Security   I know I’ve been complaining a lot, so here are some positives. The fingerprint is really fast, and its placement is good too. I have read a few comments from users complaining about having to stretch to reach it, but I haven’t really had that issue as everything is just under my fingers’ reach and this phone even received an update that improved the unlocking experience. The other security option, Face unlock is fast too just the way you expect a Vivo phone to do.  Battery   The dual-engine fast charging the charger of this device offers is great. There is a 5,000 mAh battery inside this phone, and the charger charges up 60% of the battery in an hour which is awesome! Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus do well when it comes to fast charging and the Y17 is no slouch. And this was necessary as the phone has 5000 mAh battery.  Vivo doesn’t show screen-on-time on its phones. Nonetheless, I got around one and a half to 2 days of battery life on the phone. On a day when I used the phone nearly 7-8 hours, I ended up with 50% of charge, and that’s why this phone here is a battery champ and a phone perfect for battery hungry users.  Performance  Now, do note that I said battery hungry, not power-hungry users. And that’s because of the SoC this phone has. There is a MediaTek P35 chipset inside this phone, along with 4 GB of RAM. So, how good is the Helio P35 you ask? Just understand this way: It’s not a good performer for the price. It’s comparable with some 2 years old chipsets like Exynos 7870 and the Snapdragon 625. It’s not even comparable to Snapdragon 632 found on a much cheaper Redmi 7.  Whenever I receive a fresh set of review smartphone, the first thing I do is run benchmark tests to see how they fare. And the Y17, even with that pricing, scored nearly 88000 on Antutu. Yep, just 88.  And that same thing is seen when playing games. PubG loads up in low graphics setting, and there were stutters here and there. Asphalt 9 works nicely, but if there’s a lot of action happening, it lacks a bit of smoothness. However, Dream League Soccer is unplayable on this phone. The app becomes jittery and the whole thing slows down. And this is the reason why I won’t be recommending this phone to anyone because when you’re paying a lot for a phone, you can at least expect it to perform well, even if there has been a compromise in the optics aspect.  Camera   Let’s talk about the optics part now. There are triple rear cameras on the back of the Y17, each, obviously serving a different purpose. There is a primary, a wide-angle, and a depth sensor inside the gold lining.  While a couple of the previous Vivo phones I reviewed had a greenish tint on their photos, the Y17 has a natural tint on its images. Even the temperature is natural in the day time. There is good saturation, and the details are decent. I would have definitely liked better colors, and dynamic range, though. And like other Vivo phones, this camera also overexposes the shots at times.        1  of 6                                                                              But once you enable the wide-angle lens, you will notice images with a lot of warmth. Check out some of the shots, the yellowish tint has prevailed so much that you cannot see true colors. The details aren’t good either. So, even if the primary camera does a well-enough job, you will be let down by the wide-angle camera.      Vivo Y17 Wide-Angle Camera Samples   1  of 4                                                          The third camera is a depth sensor. The background is blurred properly, although the exposure is slightly more than what I would have wanted. And it does a good job identifying the subjects too. However, if there is a strand of hair or fingers needed to be blurred, the phone finds it hard to do so. And is it just me or are the edges a little softer?      Vivo Y17 Portrait Samples   1  of 3                                                As for the night time, well, if you have shaky hands like me, the pictures might come out with slight blur. The colors are decent, but there are little details, and there is a lot of noise on the pictures. The same goes for the wide-angle lens.                Now let’s talk about selfies now. Vivo is well-known for selfies but Y17 is not that great. I mean it is good, but with almost all manufacturers focusing on selfies, I expected better and the skin tone could have been better too. There is also a selfie portrait feature on the phone, but blurring on the edges of my head is not that great.      Vivo Y17 Front Camera Samples   1  of 4                                                          Software   Let me add another feature to something that’s not great. Now, this is my personal preference as I am oriented towards stock Android. The UI Vivo has implemented on its phone is something that I don’t like. The company did bring in a few updates like this apple-ish control center and everything, but I am not really a big fan of this. Also, if you’re in an app, and you go to recent applications, and you try to clear all apps, the app you last used won’t clear out. Weird!  But I do like the fact that there is 128 GB of memory which is expandable as well. The mono speaker lacks bass, but it is clear and fairly loud.  Conclusion  When I first got my hands on with the Y17, I knew that its specifications were below par when compared against competition. But I wanted to give this device a chance since specs aren’t everything and a lot of devices I review do better than their specs on paper.  I really liked the battery of this device, as I nearly ended two days with it. There is fast charging which is quite fast. But other than that, there is nothing outstanding about this device.  The display is only HD, the performance is average, while the competition excels in those areas. Companies like Xiaomi, Samsung and Realme are really excelling in the budget price segment, and although Vivo has tried to compete against them with the Y17’s triple cameras and large battery, the phone is overpriced for me. So, maybe a price cut of some Rs. 3-4,000 should lure future buyers.      Pros  Cons    – Great Battery Life  – Micro USB Port    – Triple Cameras  – Under-par Performance    – Fast Charging  – HD Display']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Vivo-Y17-Review.jpg']

['Huawei unveils the new Kirin 810 chipset: Outscores Snapdragon 730 in benchmarks'],['Huawei'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 23, 2019']",2019-06-23 09:29:33+00:00,"['When Huawei announced the Kirin 710 chipset, the company promised to deliver a performance equal to the Snapdragon 710. However, the chip was only capable of competing against the Snapdragon 660, a-year old chip, by then. And the Kirin 710 was Huawei’s go to chip for almost all of their and Honor’s mid-range phones. So, when the company released the Huawei HiSilicon Kirin 810 chipset, it came as a relief to Huawei fans.  When it comes to the phone chip-sets, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors are immensely popular. The company has segregated its chipsets into budget, midrange and flagship segments. And almost all of these processors are leading their respective segments. In that run, the recently launched midrange  Snapdragon 730 processor  also made quite a mark in the market. It recorded a remarkable 210,052 score in AnTuTu benchmark, amazing everyone. And probably no one thought there could be a better mid-range chip. However, the Kirin 810 (used on the Huawei Nova 5) scored a whopping 237,437 score, a notable 13% performance lead over the SD730.  Huawei HiSilicon Kirin 810 chipset Overview:  The Kirin 710 was based on a 12nm fabrication technique, which made it slightly inefficient than the  Snapdragon 675  (11 nm) and the  SD 710  (10 nm). And the  SD 730  left it far behind with its 8 nm architecture. But, Huawei after taking a long time, finally has one-upped Qualcomm by launching a 7 nm mid-range chipset. But the  Kirin 810  leads not only because of its  nanometer architecture .        Also, the\xa0 Kirin 810 SoC houses an  eight-core CPU . These cores comprise of two high-performance ARM Cortex-A76 cores, which clocks at 2.27 GHz. And the six power-efficient ARM Cortex-A55 cores tick at 1.88 GHz. With this CPU setup, the  Kirin 810 promises 11% better single-core and 13% better multi-core performance  than the SD730.   In addition, Huawei has replaced the Mali-G51 MP4 GPU with  Mali-G52 MP6 GPU . With this new GPU, Huawei claims to deliver  162% better performance than the Kirin 710 . The Mali-G52 MP6 GPU is also a better performer than the Adreno 618 on the SD730. Games and graphics contents are supposed to run with up to 44% higher frame rates.   For the AI-related tasks, Huawei has integrated  DaVinci NPU , which is based on the Rubik’s Cube Quantitative Stereo Arithmetic Unit. This NPU is even said to surpass the Snapdragon 855 and MediaTek Helio P90 in the AI-related tasks. However, I have my doubts.  Apart from the AI, this NPU also helps the GPU, CPU, and memory communicate faster. It also aids other components to run more efficiently, which ensures stable performance for prolonged periods.   Furthermore, with the cameras on phones improving significantly time, Huawei has equipped the flagship-grade IVP + ISP with upgraded pixel processing unit into the new SoC. The ISP also features an improved white balance algorithm and noise reduction in RAW image processing. So it might help the cameras deliver better low-light images with sharp and noise-less details.  The SoC first made its debut through  Huawei Nova 5 . In the coming days, this chipset will eventually come on other mid-tier Huawei and Honor devices as well.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/huawei-hisilicon-kirin-810-chipset.jpg']
['Huawei Nova 5 Series launched: Will make it to Nepal as well'],['Huawei'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['June 23, 2019']",2019-06-23 09:22:09+00:00,"['Huawei has a good lineup of smartphones in almost all price ranges. Their flagships like the  P30 and P30 Pro  are still one of the best flagships out there. And they have some good mid-rangers like the  Huawei Y9 2019  and the likes. But, the most desirable of them all is their Nova series. The Nova series combines the premium look and build with enough power and an affordable price tag. But, of course, Nova series comprise of phones in all price ranges, as well. And so, Huawei Nova 5 series launched in China very recently.  The Nova 3 series, with the Nova 3 and Nova 3i were highly popular. But the Nova 4 didn’t get as much attention, probably, because there was only one variant. However, this time, the Huawei Nova 5 series brings 3 variants: the Nova 5 Pro, Nova 5 and Nova 5i.  Huawei Nova 5 Pro Overview  The Nova 5 Pro is the most premium of the three phones it’s launching. This phone carries the Nova legacy forward – to provide flagship performance in a more affordable price. So, needless to say, it features the  Kirin 980 processor , and combined with  8 GB RAM , it performs as good as the flagships from Huawei.         But of course, there has to be some difference between flagships and premium mid-rangers. So, this phone comes with a  6.39″ Full-HD+ OLED screen , with a water-drop notch. It does pack a  quad-camera setup  at the back, but they’re not as good as the ones on the P30 Pro. The camera comprises of a 48 MP main lens, a 16 MP ultra-wide lens, 2 MP depth sensor and another 2 MP macro lens. The macro lens is a new addition, but seems redundant, because the P30 and P30 series could do it without a dedicated lens. Anyway, there’s a quad-camera setup, which counts for something. In addition, the selfie camera is a 32 MP lens.  Besides these, the Nova 5 Pro packs a large  4000 mAh battery  and the flagship grade 40-Watt SuperCharge as well.  Specifications:   Display : 6.39″ OLED display with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2340 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Quad-cameras, 48 MP primary lens with f/1.8 aperture with PDAF + 16 MP Ultra-wide with f/2.2 + 2 MP macro lens + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : 32 MP lens with f/2.0  Processor : HiSilicon Kirin 980  CPU : Octa-core (2×2.6 GHz Cortex-A76 & 2×1.92 GHz Cortex-A76 & 4×1.8 GHz Cortex-A55)  GPU : Mali-G76 MP10  RAM : 8 GB  Storage : 128 / 256 GB onboard, expandable via Nano-Memory  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery : 4000 mAh, 40-Watt SuperCharge   Huawei Nova 5 Overview  The Nova 5 is the middle of the line in this series. This is a different approach, because, previously, the Nova 3 and the 4 held the helm. But with the arrival of the Nova 5 Pro, it changed. Still, this phone packs the latest mid-range chipset, the  Krin 810 . This comes as quite a relief because Huawei had been stuck on the 710 for its mid-range phones for quite some time. The 710 showed up on almost every mid-range Huawei or Honor phone, so, this is a great relief. Also, this Kirin 810 has a significant boost over the 710 and it even outscored the  Snapdragon 730 , which is another good news.   Besides the new processor, the Nova 5 packs identical specs to the Nova 5 Pro – the same screen, same camera setup, same battery and everything else. But with these specs, this phone will probably lie somewhere between a mid-range device and a premium mid-range one…  Specifications:   Display : 6.39″ OLED display with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2340 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Quad-cameras, 48 MP primary lens with f/1.8 aperture with PDAF + 16 MP Ultra-wide with f/2.2 + 2 MP macro lens + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : 32 MP lens with f/2.0  Processor : HiSilicon Kirin 810  CPU : Octa-core (2×2.7 GHz Cortex-A76 & 6×1.88 GHz Cortex-A55)  GPU : Mali-G52 MP6  RAM : 8 GB  Storage : 128 GB onboard, expandable via Nano-Memory  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery : 4000 mAh, 40-Watt SuperCharge   Huawei Nova Nova 5i  Even with the Kirin 810 out, Huawei couldn’t let go of its ever-faithful 710 chip, it seems. Because… they still packed the chipset into the Nova 5i, which is the most affordable of the bunch. And this one has quite a few differences from the other two. For starters, there’s an  IPS LCD display  with a  punch-hole  on the left. I would’ve liked similar approaches on the Nova 5 and 5 Pro as well, but they stuck with a water-drop notch in there.   Anyway, the resolution is still  Full HD+  in here. You still get the  quad-camera setup  with some adjustments. While the dedicated macro lens and the depth sensor stay the same, the other sensors got toned down by half. It packs a 24 MP main lens and an 8 MP ultra-wide lens. And the selfie camera is a 24 MP sensor, too. Also, the memory options rest at 6 / 8 GB with 128 GB storage. In addition, the battery is still a 4000 mAh unit, but it packs the standard 18-Watt Fast Charging instead of a SuperCharge.  So, you can say it is an aggressively mid-range smartphone with the specs it packs.  Specifications:   Display : 6.4″ IPS LCD display with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2310 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Quad-cameras, 24 MP primary lens with f/1.8 aperture with PDAF + 8 MP Ultra-wide with f/2.2 + 2 MP macro lens + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : 24 MP lens with f/2.0  Processor : HiSilicon Kirin 710  CPU : Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU : Mali-G51 MP4  RAM : 6 / 8 GB  Storage : 128 GB onboard, expandable via Nano-Memory  Sensors:  Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery : 4000 mAh, 18-Watt Fast Charge   Nova 5 Series Prices and Availability  Right now, all these phones are only available in China, where it launched. It makes sense, because, it’s the only place where the recent hurdles don’t affect the company much at all. The Nova 5 Pro starts at CNY 2,999 ($435) and CNY 3,399 ($500, 256 GB model), while the Nova 5 costs about CNY 2,999 ($435), too. The 5i starts at a very affordable price of CNY 1,999 ($290)!  Despite all of the hurdles, Huawei does plan to launch the Nova 5 Series in Nepal as well. Because the Nova 3 series did make quite a splash in here. So, it somewhat makes sense. And if you’re worried about the Android ban thing,  Huawei Nepal promises to refund you fully  if Google apps stop working on your Huawei phone. So, I guess, there’s nothing to worry about, really.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nova-5-series.jpg']

The Nova series is quite notable in the midrange and premium-midrange territory. So, it received quite the attention as well. But besides the Nova series, Huawei also launched its high-end MediaPad tablets. The new  Huawei MediaPad M6  is the direct successor to the MediaPad M5 with new features and some fancy upgrades.  Overview:  The MediaPad M6 comes in two variants. The smaller one features an  8.4-inch display  whereas the bigger one has a  10.8-inch IPS panel . However, both of them sport 2K resolution screens. Also, besides the size, another major difference between these is the battery capacity. The bigger Huawei MediaPad M6 10.8 flaunts a sizable  7500mAh battery  whereas the MediaPad M6 8.4 enjoys a modest  6100mAh capacity . Apart from that, these are barely any other differences.         These tabs are powered by Huawei’s flagship processor,  HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset . So, there will be no issues regarding the performance. In addition, there is a  4GB RAM  which is ample enough for multitasking. I’d have preferred 6 GB at least, but 4 GB can get the job done as well. Furthermore, to ensure swift performance while gaming, Huawei has also integrated  GPU Turbo Boost 3.0 technology  into the device. As for storage, the tablet comes in two memory variants:  64GB  and  128GB .  The tablets run on  Android Pie  out of the box with Huawei’s custom skin  EMUI 9.1  on top. Camera wise, there is a single  13MP rear shooter  and an  8MP snapper  up front. Still, I don’t really think anyone cares about cameras on a tablet.   When it comes to the audio, the MediaPad M6 features quite a fancy upgrade over its predecessor. The device features  four-channel speakers  to give off some crisp and powerful sound.  Tuned by Harman-Kardon,  Huawei claims it produces loud and resonating bass. That’s something for the audiophiles out there. There is also a  3.5mm headphone jack  if you wish to skip the speakers’ sound and listen to audio from wired headphones. Furthermore, Huawei has included  new pogo pins , which lets the users connect keyboard case for added productivity.

Last month, the White House signed an  executive order  that blocked US companies from dealing with foreign companies that built telecommunication equipment. The target of this sanction was Huawei, and that’s why the company has been getting a lot of cold responses from US-based companies.  Google was among the first companies to react to this ban as it detained Huawei’s Android license. While that is a little loose right now, it is still unclear as to how Huawei will proceed with the software in its future devices.  Amid all this, Huawei’s importer for Nepal,  Call Mobility , recently circulated a notice among its customers and channel partners addressing the software fiasco.        In the notice, Huawei Nepal has mentioned that the company will continue providing the best after sales service to its customers even under all the pressure it is facing. The major talking point in this notice is definitely the ‘full money-back guarantee’ for smartphones and tablets from Huawei if they ever happen to lose access to the necessary applications. These applications could be Google apps like Google Play, Youtube, Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. or non-Google apps like Facebook, Instagram, Viber, Whatsapp, etc.  This offer will be valid for the smartphones and tablets that have been officially bought in Nepal through Huawei Nepal’s channels. Huawei has also included the list of applicable phones:   Y-series: Y3 2017, Y3 2018, Y5 Lite, Y5 Prime 2018, Y5 Pro 2019, Y6 Prime 2018, Y6 Pro 2019, Y7 Pro 2018, Y7 Pro 2019, Y7 Pro 2019 (64 GB), Y9 2018, Y9 2019, Y Max  Nova-series: Nova 2 Lite, Nova 2i Lite, Nova 2i, Nova 3e, Nova 3i, Nova 3, Nova 4  Tab-series: Mediapad T3 7″, 8″, 10″  P-series: P30 Lite, P20, P20 Pro, P30, P30 Pro  Mate-series: Mate 10, Mate 20 Pro   This news follows Huawei Philippines’ step. Huawei had introduced the same refund offer for its Philippino users on June 19.  Huawei users around the world have been worried about their phones and tablets after the USA’s ban.

Samsung was the first one to react  and  Nokia  followed. Going with the flow, Oppo Nepal also recently slashed the price of two smartphones in their lineup. This time, Oppo chose the Oppo F11 and  Oppo A5s  to cut down the prices.  Oppo F11  Oppo’s F-series smartphones mostly occupy a notable place in the midrange market. And the Oppo F11 is no exception. The camera-centric device comes with a tagline “Brilliant Portrait in Low light”. For that, Oppo has employed a 48MP camera on the back, alongside a 5MP depth sensor. The primary shooter uses  pixel binning technology  as well, and while it does lower the end resolution of photos, it makes for better low light images as well. The secondary 5MP works like it’s supposed to while taking portrait images.         Up front, there is a  6.53-inch display  with  Full-HD+ resolution  and a tiny waterdrop style notch on top. And that notch houses its  16MP selfie camera . The front shooter also captures some noteworthy selfies. Users also get plenty of options to enhance their selfies with various kinds of AI beautifications.  Powering the device is  MediaTek Helio P70 chipset  paired with  4GB of RAM .

['MDMS system coming really soon: NTA hopes to shut down grey market in Nepal'],"['MDMS', 'Nepal Telecom']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 19, 2019']",2019-06-19 13:18:03+00:00,"['Nepal Telecommunication Authority ( NTA ) has been aggressively striving to shut down the grey market. For that, NTA was looking to develop MDMS (Mobile Device Management System) and implement it to bring illegal import of mobile phones in Nepal under control. And after doing assessments for a fairly long time, the Authority finally selected the company, which would design and develop the system.  NTA recently released a  public notice in Gorkhapatra  revealing the company name awarded to take on the project. After the various selection processes, the authority awarded the joint venture of M/s Numera (M) Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia, OSI Consulting Pvt. Ltd., India, and Namaste Global Communication Pte. Ltd., Singapore (JV) for the execution of the contract. The scope of work for the winning company would involve providing consultancy services for design, development, supply, installation, testing, commissioning, and operation of MDMS in Nepal.  Also Read:\xa0 Smartphone Import drop by 50% in Nepal, Grey market flourishing        The Authority had requested proposals from interested companies for the operation of MDMS last year. In which six companies had given applications. Only four of those companies had applied for the project with technical and financial proposals. Among those four, two were eliminated from the selection process for not fulfilling the criteria. Lastly, in the competition between these two remaining companies, Numera got nominated since it had $5000 less bid amount than its competing bidder. So with the contract amount of $7,066,888.00 (excluding VAT), Numera has to complete the project.  What is MDMS (Mobile Device Management System)?  The MDMS system will concentrate on registering the mobile device’s identity in the NTA’s database. The MDMS system will encompass the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number of all the mobile devices (smartphones, bar phones, feature phones, phablets, etc.) used for telecommunication in Nepal. In the system, the mobile devices will be primarily categorized into White List, Black List, and Grey List.  Black List  If a mobile device (stating the IMEI number) has complained about illegal activities or if somebody filed a case reporting a theft then these devices would be blocked by the system. So when somebody inserts a SIM (NTC, Ncell, Smart Cell, or from any other network), the NTA’s MDMS database will recognize it as illicit and will block the telecommunication activities.  Grey List  As the name implies, these are the devices, which are brought to Nepal through unauthorized or grey channels. Importing mobile devices from abroad and not registering it for the MDMS system will get your device enlisted in the Grey list. Users will be unable to perform telecommunication activities on these devices. So basically speaking, there would be the same treatment for the devices recorded on the Black List and Grey List. The only difference would be that the owners of the Grey mobiles will be able to register their handsets in NTA’s system and unblock the services. But Blacklisted mobile users can’t do so.  White List  All the mobile devices, which have been registered for use in Nepal will be enlisted in this list. And all the telecommunication features (Call, SMS, Internet, etc.) would be unlocked for these devices. The mobile devices imported through the authorized channels would only be enlisted in this list. If you have bought a mobile phone from an authorized outlet (online/offline), you don’t have to worry about it.  Timeline  NTA has issued the “Letter of Intent” to the winning company, which will last for 7 days. After that, the winning company will get 15 days of time to deposit a 5% performance bond. Only by doing so, the company will get a chance to commence the project.  If the winning company successfully completes these processes, it will be awarded six months of time to complete the project. This means that within six months and 22 days, we might be able to witness a full-fledged version of MDMS coming live. However, the works for the winning company doesn’t really end there. Even after the completion of the MDMS system, the winning company has to provide regular support to NTA regarding this system.  Advantages of MDMS system in Nepal  With the MDMS system, the Authority plans to completely shut down the grey market in Nepal. Every importer, who brings mobile devices from abroad has to register in NTA paying the allocated amount of taxes. In doing so, users will actually have to pay more for the device than buying the same product in Nepal. So the buying and selling process of the mobiles from unauthorized channels will start to culminate.  In order to use a mobile device in Nepal, customers have to pay the taxes for the import. With these taxes, the government generates revenue. So it’s actually a good thing. Apart from that, the Authority also hopes to minimize mobile thefts.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mobile-Device-Management-System.png']
['EaseUS Data Recovery review: Do you really need to pay for a recovery tool?'],"['Software', 'Sponsored Post']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['June 19, 2019']",2019-06-19 09:33:07+00:00,"['Right. So this is unusual for us to write reviews of software really. But I’d been hearing about this  EaseUS Data  Recovery Wizard Professional  for some time, and thought I’d give it a shot. And this is a paid software that  costs around $70 . Needless to say, it’s not cheap. But they had some great 5-star reviews, even for a paid software, so, I thought, why not? Long story short, we got the software and tested it out. So, here are the results.  How to get it?  You can easily get the EaseUS Data Recovery Software through their site. Right now,  EaseUS Software   available for $69.95 . And you can purchase it via a number of currencies, wherever they’re available. For an additional $15, you can also get BackUp CD to backup your data in as well!  There’s no need to create accounts. You can simply purchase it via credit card or other online payment methods. So, you can say it’s hassle-free as well.         Buy EaseUS Data Recovery Here  Of course, you also get a free Trial version, but as it is with these kinds of products, the Trial version cannot do half the things the regular one does.  Installation  Installation is pretty easy. You actually don’t even have to specify a destination. It’ll automatically place itself in the  Program Files  folder of your computer. Once you do, it’ll ask you for an activation code, which you get after you purchase it. Enter the code, and you’re done!  Ease of Use  The EaseUs Data Recovery tool is fairly easy to use. The user interface looks vibrant but not look too overwhelming like some other apps do. If you’ve used other Recovery Tools, then, you’ll feel right at home. Personally, I thought this was easier than Recuva – which seems to be the most popular free recovery tool there is.   When you open the EaseUs app, it displays your computer’s drives in the home screen itself. From there on, it’s very easy to navigate through – all your internal and external drives are right there, the menu is on the top-right corner and there’s also a “Load Session”, which, we’ll talk about later.  Also, you can specify the section of your computer you want to scan for files – Desktop, Recycle Bin, or a Specific Folder, besides those drives. If you have an external drive/storage plugged in, you can see it right there, too. However, there are some other drives that you might not recognize.   Those drives contain, what a normal layman would call jargon. Those who really know their way around a computer might be able to make sense of it. But for the regulars, you’re better off without trying to figure it out. The tool does its job well without them too, so, it’s all good.   Selecting a particular drive will immediately show you the list of files and folder inside. Plus, it immediately begins scanning the drive when you go into it, and so, shows you a list of all the deleted files in a separate section too. And this is what makes it a very convenient tool. All the tools are located right on the screen, and you don’t have to search for long to find a specific setting. Therefore, you can say it’s easy to use, mostly.  EaseUS Data Recovery Features  There’s not all that much to discuss in this department. Because essentially, this software does what it’s supposed to – recover your lost and deleted files. And it does…but with some limitations.  As aforementioned, you don’t need to search any drive or folder extensively to look for your lost files. It’ll promptly start scanning them right away. What’s surprising, however, is that when you click on “Scan” from the home screen, it’ doesn’t scan the whole computer. Instead, it’ll take you to this “Recovered File” folder, which, actually doesn’t seem to have anything useful.      Types of View Options   1  of 3               Large Icons         Details         Preview Pane                     But if you select your drives, then this auto-scan is very convenient. Deleted files and Present files are located under different headings, and so, you can easily find your lost files. Also, there are  three different types of the Window view . One is Large Icons, which, basically, organizes the contents in big icons – just like the name suggests. Another one is Details, which organizes the contents in a list with details like format, date modified, etc. and the other one is called Preview Pane. This creates a list with a Preview box on the side. Whichever file/folder you select, all the details are present on the preview box on the side, along with a live view of what that file contains – if the format is supported.  You see, the software can recover all kinds of file formats. But the  preview is limited  to a select few formats – .jpeg, or .png or other image files. You can preview documents and videos using the software, after the scanning（quick or deep) is over.  \xa0      Preview Window   1  of 4               Preview Images         Preview Videos         Error         Filter                        \xa0  In addition, there’s a Preview button on top, right beside the View buttons. That will give you another larger preview window with all the information about it. In addition, there’s also a search option on top, through which you can search for a specific file/folder. Furthermore, a Filter Option on the left lets you decide what kind of file you’re looking for – images, videos, documents. etc. And it will only show you those file formats. That is pretty convenient.      Load / scan session   1  of 2               Save scan session         Load session                  Furthermore, there’s an option to pause your scanning of drives, save it, and continue from where you left off later. If you are in the middle of a scan and want to go to a different drive, you can save the session. If you choose to do so, it’ll save the scanned data in a  .rsf (Recovery State File)  format. This allows you to “load session” – the feature we talked about earlier.  Recovery  The primary function of this software, Recovery, is, in my opinion, a mixed bag. While I was able to find a 3-years old deleted Photoshop file, recover it successfully, and work with it, I also had problems while recovering photos I deleted a few weeks ago.  And there’s no guarantee it’ll recover all of the contents in your folder. Yes, it can very well recover large folders of over 10 GB as well, but it didn’t recover all the photos in there. Basically, when you’re browsing through a folder full of images, it’ll successfully recover those that you can preview on the side. The ones that you can’t preview, it won’t be able to recover…at least, in my experience.   However, that goes only for image files, because, as I already said, it won’t let you preview other file formats. But there’s some inconsistency in there too. I tried recovering the same deleted folder full of images twice – in two different locations. And the number of photos recovered each time was different.      Recovery   1  of 3               Recovery destination folder         Recovery Process         post-recovery                     And as for the location, when you choose to recover a file, it prompts you to select a location, and it’ll save the folders/files under “Recovered Files \\ Deleted Files” inside the chosen location. So, if you want your files recovered to the exact folder of your choice, you’ll have to go through some minor hassle of relocating those files.  I also deleted some movies, and while you can’t preview them, it successfully recovered them as well. Even .bin files for games recovered – those as large as 5 GB\xa0 each, and I was able to reinstall the whole game, too!  But again, I was not able to recover a formatted external drive. This is a big deal, because, EaseUS claims that it can recover formatted drives, too. However, I was not able to. And since it scans the drives automatically, there are no other options with Deep Scan or anything like that. The software claims it Deep Scans your drives automatically. So, no luck with recovering formatted drives. I tried it twice, and it didn’t work for me both the times.  Memory Consumption  Okay, while the software itself is a small sized app, it can consume quite the amount of computer resources. Particularly, it can show you a 100% Disk Usage while you’re scanning your drives. That may not be a problem for well-configured PCs or laptops, but for something with average specs, this software is not for them.   Needless to say, this is not for all kinds of computers. A good spec-sheet is a must.  Conclusion  This EaseUS Data Recovery is off to a good start. Of course, it’s been around for quite a while, but there are still a lot of things it needs to improve. The user interface and navigation are simple, and so, it is pretty easy to use for most. But the recovery  doesn’t guarantee 100% that all your data will be recovered . And it’s more difficult recovering formatted files.  While I hope that it’ll get better with time, I think you should first try the free version of EaseUS Data Recovery as it performs mostly similar to the paid version. So, do you really need to pay for a data recovery tool? Still, let’s see if any future updates will bring better features.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/easeus-data-recovery-review.jpg']

As far as GPU is concerned, there are 3 options: GTX 1650, GTX 1660Ti, and RTX 2060.\xa0 If you are a casual gamer, the GTX 1650 would be sufficient. However, if you are a heavy gamer and play AAA titles, getting GTX 1660Ti or the RTX 2060 version would be ideal for you.

['Yasuda 55-inch 4K Smart LED TV Review: Best 55-inch 4K TV in Nepal under 1 Lakh?'],"['Reviews', 'Television', 'TV', 'Yasuda']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 18, 2019']",2019-06-18 13:33:56+00:00,"['The Cricket World Cup is creating quite a buzz these days. And this ICC World Cup 2019 is something that has quite the audience. We, too, are fairly enthusiastic when it comes to cricket, and so, we got a new TV for that purpose in our office. But instead of going for brands like LG or Samsung, we thought why not give the underdogs the benefit of the doubt? So, we got this Yasuda 55″ 4K Smart LED TV.  Originally priced at Rs. 87,969, this TV was available for Rs. 74,774 due to its  15% discount in its recent Cricket World Cup offer . This TV did sound impressive on paper when we first eyed it. But let’s also find if this really is impressive in real life. This is a detailed review of the Yasuda 55-inch 4K Smart LED TV Review.         Yasuda 55-inch 4K Smart LED TV (YS-55UC3) Specs:   Display:  55” Ultra-HD 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels) Display, A+ Panel, Eye protection  OS: \xa0Android 6.0 Marshmallow  CPU:  Quad-Core Processor  Memory:  2GB RAM, 8GB of onboard storage  Connectivity:  In-built Wi-Fi, 3x HDMI Input, 4x USB-A Port, 1x Headphone Jack  Warranty:  3 Years Warranty  Original Price:  Rs. 87,969  Cricket World Cup Offer Price : Rs. 74,774   Design  Aesthetically, the TV looks amazing because of its slim form factor. Adding to its attractiveness is the thin bezels around the display. However, being large in size, it occupies quite a lot of space on a table. So, I think its best if you mount it on the wall, which is what we did.  Wall-mounted TV  Software  This smart TV runs on Android Marshmallow (v6.0) on its system. So the UI, icons, and features look quite familiar, too. Android smartphone users can feel right at home. But since it’s a bit older version, you might not take some time to get used to, though. Still, navigating through the features is also, more or less, similar. However, that can also can be hassle-free at times, because, well, shuffling through with the remote is a bit cumbersome. For example, typing the Wi-Fi password and searching for a video can make you want to pull your hair out. To ease the problems, however, you can make use of a mouse and a keyboard. Probably that’s the reason why Yasuda has incorporated a fair number of USB ports in the device, and I like it.  User Interface  Specwise, this 4K LED TV also comes with 2 GB RAM and 8 GB of internal storage. If you are storing a video clip or taking a snapshot (screenshot), the TV stores those files in this onboard memory.  Connectivity  The connectivity, on this one, is great, actually. You get built-in Wi-Fi as well, which lets you stream YouTube/Netflix videos online or browse through the internet too. However, the Wi-Fi connectivity is not very good, to be honest. Even if you have fast and stable internet, the TV is sluggish to load the contents. But as a solution to that, you get a LAN port. With that, you can experience a remarkable jump in the internet speeds (compared with Wi-Fi). And during our usage with the LAN connection in our office, we were able to watch YouTube videos at a native 4K resolution, without any buffering. So you could say its quite impressive.  However, the 4K videos can only run at 30 fps smoothly. I tried loading them at 60 fps and noticed a few stutters. But of course, for a price like this, it’s also unfair of me to demand the best of features.        1  of 2               Ports         Ports                  In addition, there is Bluetooth, 3x HDMI ports, 4x USB ports, and a headphone jack as well, if you fancy watching this big TV alone! With the HDMI ports, you can connect your PlayStation, ChromeCast, or an Amazon Fire TV stick, too. And if you’re bored of watching the regular TV channels, you can also use it to connect your laptop or PC to it, and stream contents from there. And that can prove to be a treat…and while you’re at it, why not try to game on it?  As I mentioned earlier, the USB ports let you connect a mouse and keyboard to ease the navigation process. The ports can also be used to plug in your USB-drive to watch multimedia on the go.  Display & Sound  Now let’s talk about the display, which is the primary concern here. The display looks immaculate because of its tiny bezels. And while viewing the contents, it looks absolutely immersive. The viewing angle is also appreciable.        1  of 4               Bezel         Corner Viewing Angle         Side Viewing Angle         Front Viewing Angle                        Yasuda also claims that this TV ensures the viewers’ eyes protection. However, the company hasn’t revealed many details regarding that tech. So, that remained a mystery during our review period.  The 55-inch display here is enriched with  Ultra-HD resolution , which means that the screen here features a pixel density of 80 PPI. So while viewing the 4K contents, you need to stay at a distance of at least 1.1 meters to watch the contents seamlessly without discerning the pixels. But of course, all the TV contents are not available at such a high resolution. Even our TV service provider just had HD channels at the maximum. So if you are watching HD contents, you need to stay at a distance of 3.5 meters or more. But I suppose, with such a large screen, it is possible.   As for the display panel, Yasuda has used an  A+ panel  on this device. This kind of panel is quite different from the regular IPS or LED display. A+ panel actually refers to an achromatic panel, which uses a colorless transparent back panel on the back. And because of the colorless layer, the color will be unadulterated. That’s why such panels are said to have better color accuracy. And as far as the colors are concerned, they look fairly good. Unlike most cheap televisions, the colors did not dull or fade on this one. And that was a pleasing factor about this.  Even when it comes to sound, this 4K Smart LED TV doesn’t disappoint. The sound is sufficiently loud and sounds crisp up to 75-80% of volume. Anything above that can cause distortion. Still, it’s good enough for normal usage, but if you absolutely have to have the best sound, you should probably get a soundbar.  Remote  And of course, there’s a TV remote inside the box. And what’s interesting is that Yasuda had also included two AA batteries for the remote. The remote is a pretty basic one, nothing out of the ordinary. There’s nothing special worth mentioning, no mics either. So, no voice commands here.  Conclusion  Generally, televisions with big displays and 4K resolution are quite expensive. But segregating from the crowd, Yasuda provides some decent offerings in this 55-inch 4K Smart LED TV at a very affordable price. That’s really noteworthy. But like most of the affordable televisions, there are some compromises on this television.  The Wi-Fi connectivity could have been better and there is also a room for an improvement in the remote functionalities (voice assistant, hassle-free typing, etc.) and in the audio department. With such kind of infirmities, this TV surely is not the best 55-inch 4K smart LED TV out there. But considering its price and giving attention to all of its offerings, I found this TV as a compelling option to consider. And I can certainly recommend it to those looking to buy a big 4K TV.  Pros and Cons  Pros:   Quality display panel  Affordable  Fairly loud sound  Runs on Android OS   Cons:   Wi-Fi strength could be better  Ordinary remote control']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Yasuda-55-inch-4K-Smart-LED-TV-Review.jpg']

And recently, Xiaomi, too, released a list of smartphones in line to get the Android Q update. The list also presents the timeline as to when they’ll receive the updates. And according to that, ten smartphones will be getting the update before the end of 2019. And two of them will have to wait until the Q1 of 2020.  That list includes the flagships of Xiaomi. Namely, phones like Xiaomi Mi 9, Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Xiaomi Mi 8, Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro, Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition, etc. The list also contains premium phones like Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S, Xiaomi Mi Mix 3, Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 5G, and the new “flagship killers” like Redmi K20, and Redmi K20 Pro. These are the ones to get the update in the Q4 of 2019. Xiaomi, however, has scheduled the update for the mid-rangers, Redmi Note 7 and Note 7 Pro for Q1 of 2020. So, if you have a Redmi Note 7, you will get it, which is, good news.  And yes, Android Q update is a major attraction here. But that’s not the only “treat” for Xiaomi users. They will also get the MIUI 11 update, Xiaomi’s new custom skin on top of Android OS. In addition, the new UI is said to come with a ton of improved features. Primarily, there will be updated icons and animations and a new power saving mode. Furthermore, there will be changes to the status bar to accommodate phones with notches as well.

['List of Samsung phones/tablets to get the Android Q Update: Is your Galaxy device eligible for it?'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 17, 2019']",2019-06-17 07:24:46+00:00,"['Google will launch the next version of Android OS ( Android Q ) in October of 2019. And it promises to bring a ton of impressing features. And of course, solve what the current Android Pie lacks. Also, as usual, some smartphone companies are already providing their users Android Q Beta to their users. Google, OnePlus, and Huawei (yes, some P30 series devices received Android Q Beta) are on the top spots in that list.  But Samsung is still busy on releasing Android Pie updates on its current Galaxy devices. A time will come when Samsung will step ahead and announce the names of all the Galaxy devices to get the Android Q update. However, that day might be far away. Because we are not quite sure when the South Korean tech giant will do that. Nonetheless, if you are anxious to know if your Galaxy device is qualified for the update, here’s a list to find out.  When it comes to rolling out updates, Samsung offers two major software updates on all of its devices ( smartphones  and  tablets ). This means that, if you’ve bought a phone/tablet with Android Oreo or Android Pie OS out of the box, you will get the Android Q update. Of course, those who received the Pie update first will get Android Q first, too. But if your device featured Android Nougat or anything below that at the time of purchase, we’re afraid, there’s no Android Q for you.        List of Samsung devices to get the Android Q Update  So, here is the preliminary list of Samsung Galaxy devices that are qualified for the Android Q update:   Galaxy Fold  Galaxy S10e/S10/S10+  Galaxy S9/S9+  Galaxy Note 9  Galaxy A9 (2018)  Galaxy A7 (2018)  Galaxy A6 (2018)/A6+ (2018)  Galaxy A80  Galaxy A70  Galaxy A60  Galaxy A50  Galaxy A40  Galaxy A30  Galaxy A20  Galaxy A20e  Galaxy A10  Galaxy J6/J6+  Galaxy J8/J8+  Galaxy M10  Galaxy M20  Galaxy M30  Galaxy M40  Galaxy Tab S4  Galaxy Tab S5e  Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019)  Galaxy Tab A 10.5 (2018)   This list has been prepared after acknowledging Samsung’s traditional update policy. So when the South Korean giant releases the official list, expect a few changes. But sooner or later, the aforementioned devices will certainly get the Android Q. And the recent news about the  Galaxy J7 Nxt and J7 Pro getting the Pie update  is assuring.  Even if your smartphone or tablet is past its eligibility to receive software updates, Samsung will still continue to provide regular security updates as long as it’s not more than three years old. The Samsung devices, which were launched more than three years, will get the security updates but only if Samsung finds it necessary. However, some of the devices like Galaxy S7 and Galaxy A5 (2016) will also receive quarterly updates even in the fourth year.  Last year, before the official release of the Android Pie, Samsung had also allowed its users to test the Beta version of the OS. And we can expect the same this year. However, at this point in time, we are unable to predict, which Galaxy devices would probably be allowed for the Beta testing. Nonetheless, the probable guess would the  flagship Galaxy S10 devices .']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/samsung-galaxy-android-q-update.jpg']

As for the software, the Z1 Pro will run on Android v9.0 Pie with Vivo’s own FunTouch OS on top.  The official images of the Z1 Pro suggest towards a vertical triple camera setup.

The company achieved 282.2% growth in year-over-year sales. It also managed to secure the third position with a 10% global market in the wearable business. And all the credit for this success goes to their noteworthy devices. The  Huawei TalkBand B5  and Band 3 have also played a good part in that success. And making their mark in the international market, the Huawei Band 3 and TalkBand B5 have recently made their way to Nepal. These smartwatches are now available for purchase in Nepal via Huawei’s retail outlets and some online stores.  Huawei TalkBand B5  The TalkBand B5 comes with a 1.13-inch AMOLED display with 2.5D curved glass on the top to offer a seamless feel. The display on this device also happens to be touch-sensitive. So users can easily access the features by simply tapping and swiping the screen. But the unique part of this smartwatch has to be its design. Unlike most of the smart wearables out there, the display on the TalkBand B5 can be popped out. And the popped out unit can be used as a Bluetooth headset to have a conversation on a phone call or to listen to the music. To offer premium listening experience on such occasions, Huawei has also included a trip-core audio chip for a high-definition voice and two microphones for better noise reduction.         The wearable also supports some handy features like Caller ID, call muting, and speed dial option to quickly access a contact in order to call them. And this feature-packed is also quite safe from water, dust, and moisture. It has received IP67 certification for that.   On the storage side, there is 0.5MB (512KB) of RAM and 16MB of flash storage. Yes, it sounds trivial and it’s understandable because the smartwatch is not intended to store your files and photos. The in-built memory is merely for storing pre-installed apps. Sideloading of other apps is also not possible in this one. Nonetheless, you can unleash more of its features by connecting it to a smartphone. The TalkBand is compatible with Android 4.4 or newer version of Android. Similarly, in the Apple devices, the smart device should have iOS 9 or newer version of iOS.  Being the fitness-tracking device the B5 is also dexterous when it comes to analyzing various physical activities and health-related conditions. The B5 is furnished with TrueRelax Technology, which not only analyzes the heart rate variability but also evaluates the stress level. There is also a 24-hour continuous heart rate monitoring feature. And the company has integrated Huawei’s TruSeen 2.0 heart rate tech for the accurate measurement of the palpitation of the heart. Similarly, for sleep tracking, Huawei’s sleep tracking technology Huawei TruSleep 2.0 comes into action. This feature uses cardiopulmonary-coupled dynamics spectrum (CPC) in order to monitor complete sleep structure including REM (deep sleep). With the data from this tech, the smartwatch performs an in-depth analysis of the various stages of sleep and determines the quality of sleep. The wearable also presents recommendations to improve the sleep cycle if the user isn’t getting proper sleep.   As far as the power is concerned, the device flaunts a 108mAh battery, which promises 3.5-days of back on standby and 6-hours of talk time. Talking about the price, the smart wearable is now available for purchase at Rs. 22,500.  Huawei Band 3  The Huawei Band 3 falls on to the affordable side when it comes to the price. The Band 3 comes with a slightly smaller 0.95-inch display, which also happens to comes with AMOLED panel. The touchscreen display on this device is capped with 2.5D curved glass.   Diving into the fitness-tracking prowess, it’s great to see the device powered by Huawei TruSeen 3.0 technology.

['Huawei considering Sailfish OS: Will it sail?'],"['Android', 'Huawei']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['June 16, 2019']",2019-06-16 11:38:24+00:00,"['After all the  issues between Google and Huawei , which should be common knowledge by now, Huawei is looking right and left for alternatives. And it should, too. After all, the company has less than 2 months left until Google bans the company completely! While Huawei did shed light into its own OS,  Hongmeng  (or  ArkOS  outside China), we’re still unclear about its features. But, it seems that Huawei is also looking for other alternatives, and has found one in the form of  Sailfish OS !  This is a rather strange development, yes. Because for a company working on their own OS for a long time ago, looking for another alternative seems curious. There were even reports about  Huawei’s new OS being 60% faster than Android ! However, that was according to some preliminary tests, and since the new OS might not have all the functionalities that the Android OS has. This can, of course, make the new OS appear faster, too.  In addition, some reports claim that Huawei’s own OS is not fully ready. By now, their OS is suitable only in entry-level to low-tier devices. Hence, this new move…the alternative comes in the form of Sailfish OS.        Huawei’s Alternative Sailfish OS Overview   If you haven’t heard of this before, we don’t blame you. It almost never comes up anywhere near Android or iOS. This is a  Linux based operating system  for mobiles. And it was created by former Nokia employees in Finland. Right now, Sailfish OS is  owned by the Finnish company, called Jolla .  One of the main advantages of Sailfish OS is that all of it is open source. Meaning? Well, for Android, only its platform, AOSP (Android Open Source Platform) is free, the actual operating system is not. But for Sailfish, you can do with it as you please.  Another important feature Sailfish offers is  its privacy settings . Jolla, the owning company, only collects information from users necessary to run its services and doesn’t sell your information to third party vendors without your consent. It won’t even collect your data without your consent! And this would be a smart move on Huawei’s part as it, currently, faces accusations of violating privacy and stealing information.  In addition, Sailfish offers pretty similar features to Android and iOS. It has a better gesture-based navigation system as well. Plus, there’s  Android app compatibility , but they have to be manually sideloaded. Of course, the solution is a new dedicated app store, which, of course, requires a considerable amount of effort.  Huawei’s Implementation   Huawei, while it will use Sailfish, will use a version of it. Technically, a forked version of the Sailfish OS named  Aurora OS . What that means, is that it uses the same source code, but slightly modified. But  Aurora OS is owned by the Russian telco, Rostelecom , which is also an investor in Jolla. Also, that is currently in use, by Russian government agencies and state-owned corporations. And if you’re wondering about the strange Russia-China partnership, Huawei, actually, recently signed an agreement with Russia to develop their 5G infrastructure as well.  Of course, Huawei is not going to use the very same version. There will probably be a Chinese version first, followed by an international one later. Some reports already claim Huawei running some devices with the OS for first-round testing.  Will Sailfish OS Sail for Huawei?  Now, this is the million-dollar question! Of course, using this OS seems like a smarter move for Huawei than develop its own. This way, it will save a lot of money and effort to advertise the new OS and build all the other aspects from scratch. Also, with the credibility of Sailfish OS and privacy, the accusations surrounding Huawei might fade away too.  But if you look at it from another perspective, then, we can’t really say. Huawei is, right now, a victim of the US-China Trade War. And for it to partner with a Russian company (US and Russia aren’t really tight, either), doesn’t look all bright for the company.  As for the technical feasibility, apart from the effort required to developing an alternative for sideloading of Android apps, there isn’t much difficulty. So, for now, Huawei’s future OS is still in question.  And, by the time of this article, there have been no announcements or news from the company regarding this.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sailfish-os.jpg']

Its database includes tons of popular video contents, some of which are developed by the company itself.  After all of its accolades and success, Netflix is set to take a step into the gaming industry soon. The Californian Giants will launch two new video games this year with others following.  However, rather than developing the games itself, Netflix will collaborate with Next Games, a Finnish game developer. They will launch their first game dubbed ‘Stranger Things 3: The Game’, a game based on one of the most popular series – Stranger Things. The game will launch on July 4 next month which is coincidentally the same day the series’ 3rd season is releasing.  The Game  will be available for Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PS4 on the same day. Likewise, a new location-based puzzle game will be released in 2020.        The announcement for the games was made at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), one of the biggest gaming conferences.  Netflix also announced that another game will be coming out later this year which will be based on ‘The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance’, a series that is a prequel to The Dark Crystal. This game will also be made in collaboration with the same developer. Netflix hasn’t yet confirmed the date for this game’s launch, though.  During the event, Chris Lee, Director of interactive games at Netflix, said, “We’re looking for opportunities to extend the universe of these shows and films into other mediums. To me, it was really obvious to try to do that into video games.”  Netflix has already developed videos that interact with the users and develop the storyline according to their preferences. Black Mirror: Bandersnatch was definitely a game changer and it seems like that was the first step into Netflix’s interest in the gaming industry.

['Samsung Galaxy A80 review- Should You Buy this over S10?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['June 14, 2019']",2019-06-14 03:20:57+00:00,"['A truly bezel-less display, no notches, no punch holes, just a big clean screen. Yes, it’s the  Samsung Galaxy A80  we’re talking about. And complementing the bezel-less characteristic is not your regular pop-up camera, it’s a camera that flips around, so basically, we’re looking at a rear camera, that’s also your front camera. Interesting, isn’t it? But, what else does this upper mid-ranger has to offer? Find out in this review!   Samsung Galaxy A80 Specifications:   Design : Glass body front and back, Aluminum frame  Display : 6.7″ Super AMOLED display with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2400 pixels)  Rear Camera : Triple, 48 MP primary lens with f/2.0 aperture & PDAF + 8 MP Ultra-wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture + 3D TOF sensor  Front Camera : Rotating rear camera (48 MP primary lens with f/2.0 aperture & PDAF + 8 MP Ultra-wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture + 3D TOF sensor)  Processor : Octa-core 8 nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 730  GPU : Adreno 618  RAM : 8 GB  Storage : 128 GB on board, non-expandable  Battery : 3700 mAh, 25-W Fast Charging  Sensors : Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Price : €649 ($730)   Display:         Let’s start with the best thing about this phone, the display. It is this huge 6.7-inch screen with such minimum bezels that you sort of want to watch videos in it, all the time. And needless to say, you will have a great experience playing games as well.  It’s Samsung’s Super AMOLED panel so, no doubts, it’s nothing less than excellent. You get two color modes to choose from, natural and vivid. The natural option makes the display have a natural color tone while the Vivid mode makes it look punchier. And you can choose various temperature modes to suit your needs in the Vivid mode too.  Also read:  Samsung mobiles price in Nepal  The dark theme going around looks really cool and you can even custom schedule it like you can turn it on during the night and shut it off at daytime or you can keep it on all the time.   As for brightness, you get a pretty good amount, both indoors and outdoors. And it can go up to very low, so using it under your blanket is not going to strain your eyes a lot. Plus, you have a Blue light filter option for better protection, which is not something very new, but a helpful feature to have.  But, those default wallpapers that are given are too less. The ones that are given are not too many to choose from and the others you got to purchase. If you are someone who likes the default Samsung experience and when you get a near flagship device, you would want some more choices at least.  Enough complaining though. As a whole, the A80’s display is to die for. Although not QHD like you get on the  S10  or  Note 9 , but a good FHD panel that won’t fail to impress.  Design:   Okay now, the Galaxy A80 is a huge phone and pretty heavy to that. And as soon as you hold it, you will know what I am talking about. However, it is not ergonomic because the upper portion is way heavier than the lower, which should not be a surprise considering the rotating camera module sits on the top position.  The unit we received is in sort of an off-white color which looks very unconventional and appealing at the same time. There are metal frames surrounding it that add to the durability. The glass back looks and feels good on the hands. But as mentioned earlier, the phone is considerably heavier than the others and it’s large, so it might not be the most comfortable for people with small hands.   At the back, the cameras are placed horizontally at the top with a slight partition distinguishing it from the rest of the body. The cameras protrude out ever so slightly but nothing that creates imbalance.  Talking of buttons, the power button resides on the right while the volume buttons are placed at the left side and thankfully there is no Bixby button this time, so you won’t have to worry about those accidental pressings.   The phone is also considerably resistant to scratches, as even on such long usage there has not appeared any scratches on the back or on the front. So, that’s pretty impressive!  Talking about the front, the phone is protected by the older generation in Gorilla Glass 3 which is disappointing because Samsung seems to be cutting corners in the wrong areas. And since this is a premium device, it’s legit to expect more.  Down below, there lies the SIM slot, a USB Type C port, and single firing speaker grill. Does anything seem missing? The headphone jack and MicroSD card slot maybe? Those, evidently are gone.   About the SD card slot, since the A80 comes with 128 GB storage inside and that would pretty much be enough.\xa0\xa0So, judging the design, it would be an 8 out of 10, 2 fewer points for being slightly heavy and bulky.  Cameras:   Cameras on this thing are the same both on the front and back, after all, it’s the back camera flipping to become the front as well. As for now, let’s run down the camera specs first. The primary is a 48 MP Quad Bayer sensor that captures 12MP images via pixel binning, there’s an 8 MP ultra- wide angle lens and third is a 3D ToF sensor.  Let’s start with the images from the primary sensor. At first glance, you will love the images. The colors are nice and punchy and the overall image quality seems very good. Only what seems missing is the details.      Samsung Galaxy A80 normal images   1  of 5                                                                    You do have an option to capture images in 48MP mode, but there is very less difference in details among the two. Maybe slightest color shifts sometimes and a little bit more sharpness, but other than that, there is nothing remarkably different among the images of the 48 and 12 MP.

But the colors are ever so slightly punchier in the S10+ while the A80 produces near to natural colors. So, in terms of color reproduction, we found the A80 doing a better job.      Samsung Galaxy A80 vs S10 comparison shots   1  of 4               A80         S10         A80         S10                        There is a 3D ToF sensor, first of its kind in a Samsung phone, which is one of the best things about the phone. As a result, the Live focus portrait images are too good. The background blur looks so natural and pleasant. There are quite a few options for blurs which you can change even after taking images, so that can be really fun.      Samsung Galaxy A80 portrait samples   1  of 5                                                                    As for the wide-angle images, colors and details are better on the normal shots. The wide-angle images are not bad though. They pack in good colors although not as good as the primary but if you are looking for some good wide-angle shots, you can definitely get some from this camera.      Samsung Galaxy A80 normal vs wide angle shots   1  of 6               Normal         Wide-angle         Normal         Wide-angle         Normal         Wide-angle                              Likewise, the wide-angle images are slightly wider in the S10+ and the colors too are better in it. So, for wide- angle images, the S10 is a better choice.      Samsung Galaxy A80 vs S10 wide angle shots   1  of 4               A80 Wide angle         S10 Wide angle         A80 Wide angle         S10 Wide angle                        There are two features the Galaxy A80 lacks when compared to S10,\xa0 there’s no telephoto zoom lens and you can’t shoot 4K @60fps.  You can take 4k videos at 30 fps, but its void of any kind of stabilization while the 1080p at 60 fps gives the best outcome with good enough stabilization though slight wobbles can be noticed at times. But, all of the videos look slightly washed out a bit. So, all in all, the video capabilities on the Galaxy A80 is not as good as S10.  Also, Night time images are not comparable with the S10. Just look at these images for comparison.      Samsung Galaxy A80 vs S10 night time photos   1  of 4               A80 Night Shot         S10 Night Shot         A80 Night Shot         S10 Night Shot                            Samsung Galaxy A80 normal Vs night mode samples   1  of 8               Normal         Night Mode         Normal         Night Mode         Normal         Night Mode         Normal         Night Mode                                    There’s a dedicated night mode feature on the Galaxy A80, which the S10 recently received. And like the S10’s night mode, it does a good job in improving details and saturation and brightness levels.   About the selfies, the first thing you notice is how the skin tone is remarkably color accurate. The details are fine and the selfies look great overall.      Samsung Galaxy A80 selfie samples   1  of 7                                                                                        However, it’s a bit disappointed here as the selfie cameras do not get the same privileges as the rear camera. First thing is, there is no autofocus in the selfie camera, the focus is fixed at an arm’s length. Secondly, no 4k videos in the selfie part, the max it can do is 1080p.  However, what you can do is take wide angle selfies, a feature not even available in the S10. The wide-angle selfies look slightly on the darker side but nothing to fuss about.      Samsung Galaxy A80 normal vs wide angle selfies   1  of 4               Normal Selfie         Wide-angle Selfie         Normal Selfie         Wide-angle Selfie                        The selfie portrait also does a commendable job on the other hand. The edge detection is good with true to life background blurring. There’s also a live focus video mode that misses out on edge detection yet is not bad to whine about.  So, all in all, the Galaxy A80 has good cameras. It’s on par with S10 during the daytime, however, when it comes to video and nighttime photography, the S10 is a much better performer.  Performance:  The A80 comes packing the SD 730 chipset and 8GB RAM which is indeed powerful. The SD 730 is an upper-midrange chipset made on an 8 nm fabrication technique. It is better than the chipsets in the SD 600 series of course and slightly lesser than the flagship 800 series.  And as far as real-life performance is concerned, it does a good job, if not the best out there. However, with that price tag, they could have gone for the best indeed but they chose otherwise.  As for the benchmarks, the 730 is slightly better than the SD 675 and SD 710 but lies far behind the 855. On the GPU side, it has the Adreno 618 GPU making it slightly better than other midranges. You can enjoy playing PUBG at the high settings, stutter-free most of the times. Other games run very well too. And the large display adds to the good gaming experience.  Normally the phone works fine. There won’t experience any sort of lagginess or such ever while using this phone. It functions smooth and won’t let you down.  A slight reality check though, the performance is stellar no doubts but if performance is your priority, you can get better flagship grade performance if you add a little more money. You have options of the  OnePlus 7  or even the  S10e  for that matter.  Software and UI:   The Galaxy A80 comes with Android 9 Pie coupled with Samsung’s One UI out of the box. The One UI, as you might have seen on all the latest Samsung phones, is quite refined to say at the least.  The interface is clean and flows quite nicely. And the A80, on the software side, will feel like the S10. Everything is just so clean and brought down for the ease of one-handed use. Although one-handed usage is not recommended as the phone is large and slippery.  Back to the software, you get improved gesture navigation, a dark theme which is super cool, some additional battery settings, and a good friendly interface. There are also not many unnecessary things present to call it bloatware. Although the icons on the One UI look cartoonish, it’s not that bad to fuss about.   The fingerprint sensor is an in display ones like the Galaxy A50 and A70. This means it’s not an ultrasonic one like the S10. It’s an optical one that is not very fast I would say but will get the job done. When have we seems super-fast fingerprint sensors on Samsung’s midrange devices anyways?  There’s no Face unlock feature that is justifiable because then we would have to wait for the camera to pop out and rotate, which would make it slower and subject to criticism. So it’s better that we don’t have it at all.  Battery:  As for the battery, you get a 3,700 mAh unit inside, which is undersized for such a huge phone. On my tests, normally the battery lasts for an entire day and you will have to put it on charge at the end of the day. Normal tasks won’t drain the battery so much and if you keep features like Always on display off, you will get prolonged battery life.  The phone comes with a 25-watt fast charger which takes 30 minutes to get 50% juice, so around an hour and some minutes or so to get the phone fully charged.  Extras:  And one more thing. While the A80’s cameras look fun and everything, there is no explanation regarding the durability of the cameras meaning it holds great chances of damage. Similarly, the phone does not come with any sort of waterproofing, so you will have to be extra careful with near sources of water.   As for the audio, the single firing speaker has good loudness and less distortion in high volumes. Likewise, it packs a good amount of bass to go with your needs. Also, Using Type-c headphones, the audio from them was good enough.  Even the call quality is good. Samsung uses a piezoelectric speaker integrated into the screen, which works really well.  Conclusion:  So, in the end, it all comes down to whether you should buy the A80 or not. But that’s a tricky question because this one does cost a good amount of money, although little less than the flagship, and other than the rotating camera mechanism, it does fall back against S10 in a majority of the aspects like performance, cameras, waterproofing, and the like.  So, the choice is yours, are you willing to pay an extra premium and get the no non-sense S10 or pay less and get a unique phone with a rotating camera.  So, if you are a tech junkie who loves experiencing new tech and has the money, the Galaxy A80 is not a bad choice to go with.

Following the footstep, Nokia also recently  slashed the price of its various smartphones . And by cutting down the prices, the company also seems to be making way for the new smartphones. As quoted by a Nokia Nepal official, the company is now on the verge of two new budget-oriented smartphones: Nokia 2.2 and Nokia 3.2.  Nokia 2.2 Overview:  The Nokia 2.2 is a budget-friendly device launched in the international market just a week back. When it was announced, the phone received quite a lot of appreciation. It was mainly for the software. The phone comes with an unadulterated  stock version of Android Pie  out of the box. As the phone is a product of Google’s  Android One  program, the phone will receive timely software updates and security patches from Google itself. The Nokia 2.2 is also one of the cheapest smartphones in line to get the  Android Q  update  (as soon as it gets released).         Being a budget phone, other specs on the phones are quite modest. The phone comes with a  5.71-inch display with HD+ resolution . Going with the trend, Nokia has also incorporated a tiny water-drop style notch on the top. There is the  MediaTek Helio A22 chipset  to look after the performance on this device. And  2/3GB RAM  is provided to complement the performance. Talking about the storage, the phone comes in  16GB and 32GB  variants.  As far as the cameras are concerned, the phone gets a single shooter both on the front and on the back. The rear camera enjoys a single  13MP shooter , whereas a  5MP snapper  captures the selfies. The 5MP shooter on the front also comes into action while unlocking the device via  Face Unlock feature . All this package is powered by a  3000mAh battery .

"['HTC’s glorious Past, flailing Present and the dark Future']","['HTC', 'Opinion']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['June 13, 2019']",2019-06-13 05:23:56+00:00,"['When HTC launched the world’s first Android phone back in 2008, the HTC Dream, it kinda was a dream come true. At a time when iOS was setting a benchmark for the mobile operating system, Android came as a great alternative. And a remarkable one at that, both to the Java mobile platform and the premium but expensive iOS. While HTC’s Dream didn’t quite match all the expectations, they did become the pioneers of what we have today. And after that too, they made some awesome contributions in the smartphone industry.  Fast forward to today, the once-revered company is  clinging to life with non-remarkable products  in the market. With the launch of the  HTC U19e  and the  HTC Desire 19+  launched in Taiwan, they’re repeating the same mistakes they did in the past. And despite being contrary to expectations of people that HTC’s phone brand was dead, these new launches won’t help the company any.  What Happened to HTC?  HTC’s present efforts in the smartphone industry is nothing worth mentioning. After enjoying glory until 2012, the company, now, has faded into near irrelevance.  Google took over HTC’s design department , putting them in charge of new Pixel devices instead. And the company, which employed over 19000 people in 2013, now  employs less than 5000 worldwide!        Of course, HTC had quite the vision. It went on to power the HTC Exodus, a blockchain powered smartphone. It was a risky bet already and didn’t quite take off…it still hasn’t. With its revenue declining year after year, it is almost out of the smartphone business. We already thought they killed it off, but the two new phones are a surprise, to be sure.  But HTC, as a company, is still surviving off of their VR movement. They have announced three VR headsets: a premium  Vive Pro Eye , wireless  Vive Focus Plus , and  Vive Cosmos  this year. And there are reports that the company will also launch its  5G Hub  to provide broadband internet via 5G networks. So, the company might not die just yet, but the smartphone division seems bleak.  HTC’s Timeline: Glorious past  In order to analyze the future, it’s also necessary to look at the past. In the early years, HTC was one of the most impressive companies in the market. HTC started out as Windows PDAs and mobile manufacturer in 2004 and went mainstream since 2006. It’s success enabled it to take over a mobile manufacturing company, Dopod International, which aided in manufacturing more phones in 2007.  HTC Dream : world’s first Android phone / Source:  Wikipedia  In 2008, after joining Google’s Open Handset Alliance (basically, the Android Open Source Platform), they launched the world’s first Android device –  HTC Dream . However, they continued making Windows phones. And at a time when it was competing with  Blackberry’s OS  and Nokia’s Symbian OS, they smartly customized a smart skin ( TouchFlo ) with lots of features which can still be considered modern.  HTC Sense OS  Doing things with Windows phones that didn’t even seem possible, they were doing pretty well. And at the same time, running close to Google for development of other Android handsets meant astounding success in a short time. And later, HTC phones gave birth to  HTC Sense , showing the customizable possibilities of Android, which drove the company to more prominence.  HTC Desire S  Later in 2010,  HTC Desire  took the smartphone market by storm. In addition to being the only worthy competition to the iPhone, it “ did more and cost less “, which, ironically, was Apple’s tagline! By 2011, HTC was the biggest smartphone company in the US. Sales were increasing, and it was the golden period, for the company, because, that’s when it began to fall apart.  HTC’s Timeline: Falling off the edge  2012 was the year when the company began falling off the edge. It began losing much of its market share in the US to competitors like Samsung and Apple. It was their ambition to follow up with the Desire series, a move that would convert this small ODM to a smartphone giant. But, that backfired…  HTC One  Follow up phones like  HTC Desire HD  failed to bring anything new to the table. The HTC Desire lineup might have been, the company’s best. But it mostly failed to bring a compelling factor in them. By this time, competitors were catching up, where HTC, once used to reign.  HTC One , in 2012, tried to correct its mistakes but failed to provide something different. It was a phone that got lost in the crowd. The phone did win various awards, but its sales were pretty low – lower than Galaxy S4 flagships from Samsung.  HTC One M8  Profits were at an all-time low, but they still staggered along. With the follow-up,  HTC One M8 , HTC finally did something new! It was different, not what people were looking for, but something they didn’t know they wanted – something ahead of its time. And things were looking up, with sales rising slowly.  But, again, in 2015, with  HTC One M9 , they fell down hard! With a bare minimum of improvements over the One M8, HTC seemed to be trying to catch up instead of innovating. As other companies had already caught up, HTC’s lead was not there anymore. Their software was the only thing that was keeping it alive, really, but when Samsung started catching up, there were no other advantages.  HTC U11  Their next phones,  HTC 10  and  HTC U11 , were good phones, and best (in some aspects). But like  Nokia X , it was too little, too late! Other brands were simply too large, with similar or better features and a large market share. HTC couldn’t keep up. And after that, we know  HTC’s U12 series , couldn’t really give their audience the “something new” they wanted.  Fast forward to the present, and here we are, with the company hanging on for dear life.  HTC Timeline: Other ventures  HTC Vive Pro VR headset  Of course, one of the reasons for HTC’s smartphone brand demise is its focus on other ventures, too. HTC was focusing on its  VR Vibe Headsets , the ones they collaborated with Valve to create. And these were, far more attractive than the best of their smartphones. They were, and still are, selling well. And this might also have veered the focus out of their smartphones.  HTC Exodus  Another failure was their blockchain powered smartphone – the  HTC Exodus . It was a risky bet, something that the world didn’t ask for, neither seemed to need it, actually. Well, for the cryptocurrency fanatics, it would have been a big deal, but there aren’t too many of that in the world, are there? And it is not quite a failure yet but hasn’t really paid off for the company.  Conclusion  So, how did this glorious company go from the heights to the pitfalls? Combine  a set of terrible marketing strategies with a hint of narcissism , and you’ll get it. HTC’s marketing was never their strong suit…it kept its phones mostly in the dark.  And while their failures should have taught them something, they went back to try to create products for their old customers. But any brand living in their days of old are doomed to fail. Take Nokia for example. Of course, HMD Global’s revival is taking its toll, but, I doubt if HTC’s revival is right around the corner. Right now, HTC’s smartphone segment’s future, is bleak, at best.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/htc.jpg']
['AMD’s E3 2019 Briefing – Navi based RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT launched'],"['Processors', 'AMD']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['June 12, 2019']",2019-06-12 12:18:05+00:00,"['While AMD is getting there alongside Intel for some time now, they haven’t quite hit the sweet spot in the graphics cards department. AMD’s E3 2019 briefing focused mostly on its  Ryzen 9 3950X  CPU. However, they also did present their new graphics. The new Navi architecture is AMD’s latest attempt towards putting a dent on Nvidia’s earnings. However, this is not enough to reach glory for Team Red Ryzen. But here are the two of the first Ryzen GPUs…the glory shall come soon!  Both of the new Ryzen GPUs are Navi-based graphics cards. The  RX 5700  and  RX 5700 XT \xa0are an attempt to compete against the RTX 2060 and the RTX 2070 respectively. With a price of $450, the RX 5700 XT looks compelling against the RTX 2070 ($500), and the RX 5700 ($380) against the RTX 2060($350)         These two GPUs target 1440p gaming, and by the looks of it, offer identical performance as their Nvidia counterparts. AMD also claims these graphics cards are a worthy upgrade to their Vega 56. But to my disappointment, these GPUs have blower style cooling. They did this to minimize the loud sounds their cards are known to output, apparently. With this, the company assured us that their cards cap out at 43 dB, max.  Radeon Image Sharpening  Another feature worth discussing it the Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS). Using a  contrast-detection algorithm , the idea is to make upscaled games appear as good as native 4K. They claim to achieve this without compromising on the frame rates or awkward softening (like that on Nvidia’s DLSS technology). In addition, AMD claims it can work on thousands of games without developers having to support it.   That’s good news, but there is a small problem with this. Without the devs supporting it in their games, this cannot work on DX11 titles – only DX9, DX10, and DX12 along with Vulkan on Windows 10. So, the company is also working with some developers to integrate it directly into the games, which will be known as “ Contrast Adaptive Sharpening “. And for now, the RIS is exclusive to 5700 series cards, but other cards will be able to use this too, in the near future.  Also Read:  AMD’s E3 2019 Briefing – Ryzen 9 3950X debut, 3000-series revealed in full  Radeon Anti-Lag  This is AMD’s solution to reduce input lags, especially, in situations where the games overpower your GPU. And it will provide an edge in competitive gaming scenarios. It works by skipping a few frame rates (selectively) during the times when your CPU is waiting for your GPU to draw frames. However, it shouldn’t affect your gameplay in any way, according to AMD’s claims.  RDNA Graphics Chips  Right…so, by now, we can see that the only clear-cut advantage Nvidia seems to have over AMD is Ray Tracing. But that, too, hasn’t really taken off yet. And even in those games that do support it, you can’t tell the difference all that well. But still, AMD is trying to solve this shortcoming with their new RDNA graphics chips for hardware-related Ray Tracing. But it’s using the “select lighting effects”. So, for a foreseeable future, at least, we are looking at shader based ray tracing. This is similar to NVidia’s implementation of Ray Tracing for their graphics cards without Ray Tracing hardware.   However, AMD says the full ray tracing features may only be available through cloud gaming, like Stadia or GeForce Now. And that’s a bit confusing as both the upcoming Xbox and PlayStation are promising hardware accelerated ray tracing through Navi based GPUs for 2020.  Pricing and availability  Putting it all into perspective, these graphics cards from AMD are trying, but looks like they still have a lot to do; especially, if they’re to compete against the high-end graphics of Nvidia. But these are just the first Navi based cards and we expect some more to come. The RX 5700 and it’s XT counterpart will be available starting July 7 for $380 and $450 respectively. In addition, we will also see the Radeon RX 5700 XT 50th Anniversary Edition with deep black chassis, slightly higher clock speed (over 10TFLOP marks) for $500.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AMD-Radeon-RX.jpg']

However, this desperate move from HTC will not be earning them any points. While the once highly revered smartphone company is taking their last breaths in the smartphone industry, it’s still making feeble attempts to cling to life. Yet, they haven’t learned! The new HTC 19 phones make the same mistakes: weak performance, high prices, and old designs. The signs are clear…HTC’s glorious journey is at an end!  Read about HTC’s journey  here.  HTC U19e  Out of the two, HTC 19 devices launched, the U19E is the better one. Of course, it’s only better between the two, because, its nothing remarkable if we look at the present market. What happened to U13-U18, no one knows, because this is the first phone they’re launching after the  U12 Life series .         The U19E comes in the same old design – bearing bezels top and bottom. I’ve never liked notches, but right now, HTC needs to stick to the trend, which it’s failing at. It features a  6″ Full HD OLED screen , which, I guess is impressive. There are dual cameras at the back – a  12 MP primary  one with a  20 MP telephoto lens . The selfie camera is a whopping 24 MP while there’s also 2 MP depth sensor/face scanner up front.  Everything is powered by a  Snapdragon 710 , supported by  6 GB RAM . There’s  128 GB internal storage , and it’s also expandable via a dedicated microSD slot. The battery is also a standard 3930 mAh with 18-Watt Fast Charging. That’s fine and all, you might say, but the  price for this phone is TWD 14,900 (~$475) , which is asking a bit too much, isn’t it? We can definitely say that this is just stupid pricing.  Specifications:   Display : 6.0″ OLED panel with Full-HD+ resolution (1080 x 2160 pixels), 18:9 aspect ratio  Rear Cameras : Dual, 12 MP primary with f/1.8, PDAF + 20 MP telephoto with f/2.6 aperture  Front Camera : Dual, 24 MP with f/2.0 aperture + 2 MP depth sensor  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 710  CPU : Octa-core (2×2.2 GHz Kryo 360 Gold & 6×1.7 GHz Kryo 360 Silver  GPU : Adreno 616  RAM : 6 GB  Storage : 128 GB, expandable via microSD (dedicated slot)  OS:  Android 9.0 Pie with HTC Sense on top  Battery : 3930 mAh, 18-Watt Fast Charging   HTC Desire 19 Plus  Another HTC 19 device is the slightly inferior device to the HTC U19e. It has the same kind of design language and footprint but has a slightly larger display and there are internal hardware differences. Desire-series was once a much sought-after lineup, but not anymore.   The Desire 19+ has a slightly larger  6.2″ LCD display  with HD+ resolution, which is not something many phones go for these days. It packs  triple cameras  at the back and a single one up front. The triple camera setup comprises of a 13 MP primary camera, an 8 MP ultra-wide camera and a 5 MP depth sensor. And it’s selfie camera resides at 16 MP.  An  Helio P35 chip  runs the who, backed by  4 GB RAM , and there’s  64 GB storage  on board. The battery is a  3850 mAh battery , while there’s no word on Fast Charging yet. But all this for an asking price of  TWD 9990 (~$320) , this is very underwhelming!

You cannot get these anywhere else around the world, and maybe for good reason. Because honestly, these phones pack high prices for what they pack, and I don’t think you’d want these devices.

We expected a new top of the line GPU hardware from them, but there wasn’t any. The briefing seemed to focus on their CPUs, mostly, one of which is the AMD Ryzen 9 3950X – the apex among their CPUs.

They seemed to be pretty proud of it at the announcement, too.    “I don’t think there’s any reason people would buy an Intel processor after we do this”   Words of the Direct Client Product Manager at AMD, Travis Kirsch in regards to their newly launched Ryzen 3000 lineup!  That’s a bold statement to put up, especially when AMD is, just now, beginning to (almost) catch up with their Intel counterparts in gaming performance (finally)! But they always have the edge when it comes to price, power efficiency and delivery when it comes to non-gaming requisites. So, that may, very well, be one of the reasons for all this gloating. Let’s see how Intel answers further, and how this plays out in the end!  The Ryzen 9 will be available starting September of 2019.

And among them, the lightest of the bunch, Honor 20 Lite was launching soon in Nepal as well. And well, it did, along with another budget phone. But this is not a new one, though. So, Honor has launched the Honor 20 Lite and the Honor 8A in Nepal.  Honor 20 Lite Overview  The Honor 20 Lite, looks like the same Honor 10i that was launched back in March. And with a price of Rs.32500, this is a mid-range phone. This phone sports a  6.21-inch Full HD+ display \xa0with a waterdrop notch on the top. Underneath its body, is a\xa0 HiSilicon Kirin 710  processor that runs the show. Also, aiding it is the  Mali-G51 MP4 GPU \xa0and\xa0 4 GB of RAM . The phone also runs on Android 9.0 Pie like the other two Honor 20 devices, with EMUI on top, of course         As for the cameras, the Honor 20 Lite comes with a triple-rear-camera setup, which comprises of  24 MP primary lens \xa0with f/1.8 aperture, an\xa0 8 MP ultra-wide camera , and a\xa0 2 MP depth sensor . Also, the notch up front houses a\xa0 32-megapixel \xa0selfie shooter embedded on the notch. In addition, this phone packs a  3400 mAh battery  and has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.  This device is priced internationally at €299. And we expected it to compete against the  Oppo F11  and the  Huawei P30 Lite  with its price. But it’s actually much cheaper than that. It can be yours for  Rs.32,500 ! That’s a lot better than expected. Maybe the  current scenario  has something to do with it, but nevertheless, this is great pricing! And yes, it’ll work just fine…except the future updates are uncertain.  Specifications:   Display : 6.21-inches LTPS IPS LCD, Full HD+, 19.5:9 aspect ratio  CPU : HiSilicon Kirin 710  GPU : Mali-G51 MP4  OS : Android 9.0 Pie with EMUI 9 on top  RAM : 4 GB  Storage : 128 GB, expandable  Rear camera : Triple – 24 MP, f/1.8 (primary) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultra-wide) + 2 MP, f/2.4 (depth)  Front Camera : 32 MP, f/2.0  Battery : 3,400 mAh non-removable Li-Po battery  SIM(s) : Dual Hybrid SIM  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), Accelerometer, Proximity, and Compass  Price:\xa0 Rs.32,500   Honor 8A Overview  The Honor 8A belongs to the budget category with its modest specs. And of course, it has been around in the international market for 6 months. It sports a  6.09″ IPS display  with HD+ resolution, with a trending water-drop notch. Under the body, it runs on the budget standard  Helio P35 chip , supported by  2 GB RAM .   However, it fails to keep up with the trend with only a  13 MP single camera  at the back. The front camera is an  8 MP module . Also, only 2 GB RAM makes it a strictly budget phone. However, there’s  32 GB storage , so, it’s okay as well. The battery is  3020 mAh  unit, and there’s also a fingerprint sensor and a face unlock feature as well.  And for the price of €100 internationally, I think a Nepali price of  Rs.15,790  is good pricing, too. This competes directly with the likes of Oppo A3s in here, but of course, there’s the Galaxy M10, a much better offering for the price.

Beyond everyone’s expectation, Samsung turned out generous and started rolling out updates to such antiquated devices.  The update is slated to roll on various countries really soon. As per the reports, the OTA update for the J7 Pro has already started rolling out in the countries like Russia, Mexico, Spain, and Algeria. Similarly, the J7 Nxt users in Thailand can expect an update on their smartphones really soon. Other countries, however, will have to wait for a while to receive the update.  Along with the Android Pie, users will also be getting the new and latest version of the One UI. Since the new One UI is much optimized and very smooth to navigate, the users might enjoy it quite a lot. On top of that, there will be a May 2019 security patch.

ARM is well, something big, and besides Intel’s x86, ARM basically enjoys no competition! But the startup, known as  SiFive , which has been around for 4 years, is using  RISC-V architecture  to develop new CPUs. And one of the investors is  Qualcomm !  Why is that a big deal? Well, because Qualcomm is one of the biggest customers of ARM. And for them to financially back a direct competitor is a surprise, to say the least. Of course, RISC-V is not really a direct competitor, as it cannot they can’t go head to head with mobile and phone processors. Currently, the chips based on RISC-V are only used in IoT devices, smart-watches, wearables, and such. But definitely not mobiles and tablets.  Should ARM be worried? Well, not right away. When it comes to mobile and phone processor architecture, it’s way ahead. But SiFive is also developing rapidly, and it’s getting more and more successful in terms of collection of fundings. This is all rapidly boosting RISC-V’s development, and this can be a threat to ARM in the long run.         Why?  This is because, ARM (and other similar companies like MIPS) charges royalties for use of their designs, patents, and copyrights. Also, they require non-disclosure agreements before releasing documents that describe their designs’ details and instruction set. And in most cases, they don’t even describe the reasons behind their design choices.  All this secrecy makes the development of new hardware and software more difficult. Sure, a company, when it develops new tech, it is entitled to issue patents or copyrights. After all, it’s their hard work! But if we look at the development of technology as a whole, this is not a good thing. Also, the secrecy prevents security audits to those companies. In addition, this makes modern, high-quality general purpose computer instruction sets non-available for general usage.  RISC-V was designed to overcome those problems . It is an open-source platform usable in any software or hardware design without royalties. Plus, the explanations of all the project are explained as well. Since RISC-V designers planned to support a wide variety of practical uses: small, fast and low-power implementations, this project is more like a community effort.  So, the company SiFive is developing new processors using the open source RISC-V architecture. And with such funding and development, this new architecture might become more prominent and threaten a part of ARM’s standings. Of course, that’ll take time. But nothing is unlikely. Especially, when your investors are the likes of Qualcomm, Intel, and even Samsung!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sifive.jpg']

And if you thought these phones were not a good value for money, maybe check these out after this price drop.  Honor 7s  This smartphone runs on the  MT6739 SoC , which alone should make you not even consider it. International pricing aside, Nepal already has a few phones competing at this price point. The  Samsung Galaxy M10 , a much much better smartphone than this one, is priced at Rs.13,790. So, the price of this phone is going down even more… This new phone can be yours for  Rs.12,190!

But with its features, it more likely resembles the Note 7 than the Y3. It has a 6.21″ LCD display with Full HD+ resolution, and with a flashy glass-looking plastic body, it is quite trendy, too. In addition, with a Kirin 710 on-board, it’s looking like a direct competitor to the Redmi Note 7.    Design : Dual Gradient colors with a shiny finish  Display : 6.21″ IPS LCD Full HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels)  Rear Camera : Dual cameras, 13 MP primary with f/1.8 aperture + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : Single 24 MP with f/2.0 aperture with AI capabilities  CPU : Octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 710  GPU : ARM Mali-G51 MP4  RAM : 3GB  Storage : 64 GB (expandable with microSD up to 512 GB using SIM 2 slot)  Battery : 3400 mAh with Fast Charging  OS : Android 9.0 Pie with EMUI 9.0.1 on top  Features : Rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, Turbo Boost 2.0  Colors : Gradient Blue, Gradient Red, Night Black, Lily White  Price: Rs.  24,990\xa0 \xa0 23,990   \xa0  Honor 8X  The Honor 8X was a well-received mid-range phone despite its comparatively high pricing. Maybe because it was a well-awaited device as well. The 8X still has a regular notch up top, but that is, still in fashion, though. And with a similar Kirin 710 processor on board, the only things setting it apart from the Honor 10 Lite are the slightly better rear cameras and a larger battery.

Yes, a price cut of mere Rs.1000 isn’t really an exciting offer. I don’t know what Honor was thinking, but they did, anyway. So, it’s at least better than the former pricing!

And these  Boston Dynamics Spot Robot Dogs  aren’t cute…to say the least. Actually, if you think so, they can look pretty scary. And combine that with the fact that they’re super strong and agile, it only makes you more paranoid about the uprise of AI!  Boston Dynamics has been showing off their scarily lifelike robot-dogs in action often. And now, after some final tweaks in the design, and some testing in heavy-set areas, it’ll be ready for commercial purposes.         The quadrupedal robot relies on a  360-degree LIDAR  (Laser Image Detection And Ranging) technology to navigate. There are cameras on every side of the device, making it particularly useful in roles on construction sites, such as scanning for hazards or opening doors. Also, these robots also have a better sense of balance than us, humans. Because there are multiple videos showing of them being kicked around, and yet not falling over. In addition, there are videos of them  performing dangerous feats like opening a door , dragging a truck, and autonomously loading a dishwasher!   There will be two variants of the Boston Dynamics Spot Robot Dogs. Both operate the same way, but the  Spot Classic  can carry up to 100 pounds (~45 kg), while the  Spot Mini  is smaller, lightweight and can carry only about 30 pounds (~13.65 kg). However, in the presentation of the two dogs, some mishaps occurred, revealing that these guys weren’t the most graceful of robots.   The Spot Mini, after a short time on stage, began flailing and fell on the stage and stopped responding. However, Boston Dynamics didn’t waste time – they quickly demonstrated another Spot Mini. So, needless to say, there are still some tests pending before its full-fledged usage. However, the company has already announced it will soon be over commercially. But there’s still to be an official launch date and price tag although it will  cost some five-figures !  For a five-figure cost, these Boston Dynamic Spot Robots can be used for various purposes. These robots are usable in your household as well as. But a more practical usage is for industries, delivery, and security. Right now, these machines are under testing at some construction site and playgrounds.  These Spot robots are also pretty easy to control. You can  control them simply with a handheld controller  to tell it where to go, maneuver its robot arm and other functions. And of course, with stuff like these, there are also visions of its usage in the entertainment industry. Fancy two Boston Dynamics Spot Robot Dogs fighting inside a ring, anyone?

Facebook Cryptocurrency Overview  The cryptocurrency, Libra, will bear a likeness to  BitCoin  – the most popular cryptocurrency (for now). Libra will connect and associate itself to a number of currencies popular worldwide, and not only the US dollar. The company hopes to prevent the price fluctuations Bitcoin faces with this strategy.        So, this Facebook Cryptocurrency will stay stable with the help of a basket of  Fiat currencies . (Fiat currency means a legal tender whose value is backed by the issuing government). This should make it more stable than the normal commodity money (backed by gold or silver, in general). Also, it will make it  cross-compatible with a number of digital currencies worldwide .   Now we don’t understand everything about this currency right now. But, a  white paper about its basics is going to launch on June 18 . So, we’ll have to wait for more information. For now, all we have is that Facebook is already making preparations to launch the new cryptocurrency next year.  Facebook has already held talks with governor of the Bank of England and to US Treasury officials. The company also took former PayPal president to lead its blockchain division. Also, it’s contacting other US and British financial regulators to speed up the launching process. In addition, a firm called “ Libra Networks ” registered in Switzerland for financial services. Furthermore, Facebook also met with other cryptocurrency exchanges, Gemini and Coinbase. With all this, it is clear that Facebook is gearing up for something big.  And rightfully so. Because besides Facebook’s advertising-based revenue model, it’s also  adding e-commerce to its platform . So, we can say, Facebook might be becoming  similar to WeChat  of China, where Facebook is inaccessible. WeChat allows its users to chat, shop, and play games without leaving its platform. It’s a one-stop solution for almost all online purposes. And with this, Facebook might become very similar.  Applications  Generally, this Facebook Cryptocurrency allows you to send money to each other, pay for things on Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instagram. And also, you can use it to pay for other online marketplaces – those who will accept this form of payment. Also, rumors suggest there will be some kind of a physical device that’ll enable you to trade your currency at Libra ATMs.  Why we don’t trust it?  Well, for starters, why would you? We are all aware of Facebook’s cloud of scandals regarding the privacy of its users. Of course, we know of  Facebook’s invasive ad-targeting policies , but there are also cases of it  tracking those who don’t even use Facebook !  And with its own payment system, Facebook can use its  digital currency to spy on your purchases , too! Also, Facebook can use information about the users’ purchases to offer better target-adverts to attract further investment from firms. In addition, this will give a better understanding of who buys what, and the popularity of brands among Facebook users. Therefore, it will assist Facebook in measuring, ranking and targeting to amplify its core business.  Now, Facebook is already under scrutiny over various mishaps. But Facebook didn’t react to these new speculations. So, we never know what they’re planning. Only time will tell what Facebook is really after.  What do you think of Facebook Cryptocurrency? Do you think Facebook has ulterior motives? Or is it safe to trust it?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/facebook-cryptocurrency-2.png']
['Presenting Brain Talker: A device that lets you mind-control'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['June 8, 2019']",2019-06-08 06:43:06+00:00,"['Source: Getty Image                  When I was a kid, whenever I heard about the 5 th  gen computers and their intelligence in my computer classes, I always thought those devices could be controlled with a person’s mind. Things turned out differently, though, but the controlling part is developing gradually.  Chinese scientists and researchers have just developed a mind-reading device which can control phones and other electronic devices all by a person’s thoughts. The ‘Brain Talker’, first of its kind, has been manufactured by scientists of Tianjin University and the China Electronics Corporation. The product was unveiled at the World Intelligence Congress which was held in Tianjin Municipality, North China.  A mind-controlling device is not an alien concept in the world of technology. Two years back, Netflix had claimed that it had designed a headband that could channel the user’s thoughts to select the shows and movies. These devices work with the same idea. The brain produces pulses which decodes and travels to the electronic devices in a signal format so that the computer can understand what they are thinking.         The possibilities of devices like the Brain Talker are endless. They will let users control electronic devices without any movements or voice control. This is obviously the basic function. But think of how helpful it can be to disable people. A wheelchair user would be able to control their wheelchair with ease.  Daily Mail says, “The brain decoding chip works by picking out minor neural electrical signals within the cerebral cortex and rapidly translate them into a form that the computer can understand.”  Dong Ming, dean of Tianjin University’s Academy of Medical Engineering and Translational Medicine, said, “This brain-computer codec chip has the ability to discriminate minor neural electrical signals and decode their information efficiently, which can greatly enhance the speed and accuracy of brain-computer interfaces.”  “The Brain Talker chip advances brain-computer interface technology, allowing it to become more portable, wearable and accessible to the general public.”  The scientists haven’t yet cleared out on how the Brain Talker will be worn. Since such devices are usually worn outside, the Brain Talker is also expected to be worn in the same way. The device will also be helpful in the medical field.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/brain-talker.jpg']

The phone packs some decent specs and currently runs on Android Pie. Nokia has promised support for Android Q, making it one of the cheapest phones to do so.  Overview:  The phone offers a 5.7-inch 720x1520px LCD display with a maximum brightness of 400 nits. It’s a 19:9 ratio panel with an ‘Infinity U’ styled notch with a fairly small bezel all around. The chin is a bit huge, though not a deal breaker for a budget phone.         The phone employs the Helio A22 SoC, a Quad Core CPU clocked at 2GHz. There are two versions of the phone, one with 2GB RAM/16GB storage and the other with 3GB RAM/32GB storage. The phone does support a microSD card for storage expansion.  It gets a 13MP sensor at the back and a 5MP at the front. With support for AutoHDR and something called “low-light image fusion” technology to basically help fill dimly lit scenarios.

Leaks from a Chinese online retailer ‘Suning’ claims the phone will go official sometime by the end of this month. Putting the naming scheme aside, let’s look at these two upcoming mid-rangers and what they will potentially offer.  Huawei Nova 5 Leaks and Rumors  Browsing through the leaked spec sheet of the Nova 5, you can see the phone will offer a  6.39-inch AMOLED screen  with an  under display fingerprint scanner . Going by the leaked tempered glass and the cover, we assume there are  no notches . It also shows room for a  triple camera setup at the back .         The Nova 5 has received 3C certification in China for two variants, SEA-TL10 and SEA-AL10. Both of which (we can’t confirm they are Nova 5i and Nova 5, could just be two versions of the Nova 5) will come bundled with a  40W charger . A few other leaks suggest a  4,200mAh battery  with  44W charging .  The device will be powered by the  Kirin 980 , the same chipset used on their flagship  P30 and P30 Pro . The rear will feature the  48MP Sony IMX 586 sensor , while the front should get a  25MP camera . The leaked casing also shows room for a headphone jack on the bottom left and a slight display chin up front.  Pricing and Availability  While we have very little information on the Nova 5i, we can certainly assume both are going to be some stellar phones. With flagship grade specs, fast charging and a full view AMOLED display, the only questions here is the pricing. Since the Nova series of smartphones are basically brought at the midrange price, we can expect the same in the case of Nova 5 and Nove 5i. But to know about the exact price of these devices, we probably have to wait till its launch.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/huawei-nova-4e-1.jpg']

The display also comes with a notch on the top. But unlike most of the smartphones in 2019, which comes with a teardrop notch, this one has a slightly wider notch.

Currently, there are just rumors about the product. But the recent speculations are looks quite credible. So it might be just a matter of time when NVIDIA confirms its existence releasing an official statement. Nvidia also teased us about ‘ Something SUPER ‘ before  Computex 2019  and we are eagerly waiting for that one as well. I don’t think the RTX 2070 Ti is what Nvidia had in mind, so maybe we are in for multiple GPU launches pretty soon.  Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Ti  According to newfound leaks, the RTX 2070 Ti will be about 10-15% faster than a stock RTX 2070. CUDA core count will be at 2560 as opposed to 2304 (RTX 2070) but still not quite close to the superior RTX 2080. Other specs include 8GB of GDDR6 memory running at 14Gbps. Finally, the GPU will boost at 1770MHz (1710 on the RTX 2070; 1800 on the RTX 2080). As for pricing, the Nvidia Geforce RTX 2070 Ti could launch for anything as low as $499 to $599.  Something SUPER         In addition to the RTX 2070 Ti, we are also looking at a minor refresh to the RTX 2060, 2070 and 2080. The new cards will probably offer higher binned dies, increased clock speeds, and GDDR6 as standard across the board. This should add about 5-15% improvement in performance from the previous version. Expected to go official at E3 2019, the current 20-series GPUs will potentially receive price cuts. Plus, what will they be called, the RTX 2080 already has a Ti version, so? An RTX 2080 SUPER?  Also Read:  Samsung phones might get new GPU: Partners with AMD  Let’s just assume they will be called the RTX 2060 SUPER, 2070 SUPER, and 2080 SUPER. All three of those are rumored to retail for as low as $249, $399 and $599 respectively. With AMD quick to adopt the 7nm process, it’s still unlikely for Nvidia to follow on until the yields and TSMC’s capacity to handle the volumes increases. For now, these new cards will be based on the special Nvidia FinFET process from TSMC.  However, even with all these hurdles, Nvidia could still potentially surprise us.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Nvidia-something-SUPER.jpg']
['Galaxy A50 VS P30 Lite: The ultimate mid-range battle!'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['June 6, 2019']",2019-06-06 06:40:03+00:00,"['So, there are a lot of mid-rangers competing for the first position, each of them having their strengths and weaknesses. Two of the most prominent players in the smartphone business, Samsung and Huawei have put forward their contenders, the  Samsung Galaxy A50  and the  Huawei P30 Lite  for pretty similar pricing. In this article, we will be performing an ultimate mid-range battle between Samsung Galaxy A50 VS Huawei P30 Lite in all the aspects. And we will try to find out which one is the better deal among these two!  Design:   Let’s start things off with the design. And this has been a difficult choice. While the A50 rocks a glasstic design, the P30 Lite has taken the plastic approach. And to be honest, both do look good. What the P30 Lite does better it is, how compact and easy-going it is. On the other hand, A50 feels better on the hands and has a bit more heft to it than the P30 Lite. Similarly, the A50 is a bit wider when felt on the hands.        Going by the looks, the P30 Lite looks a bit more appealing because of its gradient design. And even though it’s plastic, it almost looks as though it’s glass. So, I would go for the P30 Lite design.   I have used these phones for quite a time now and minor scratches have appeared on the P30 Lite while the A50 seems a bit more resistant to scratches. But overall, I must say, it’s very hard to pick one among these two; both have fared well on my tests. But, because of the ergonomic design and appealing colors, I will choose the P30 Lite as the winner.  Display:   When it comes to the display, there is pretty much no debate. The Galaxy A50 sports a 6.4- inch Super AMOLED display while the P30 Lite has a 6.15- inch IPS LCD Display. And in terms of quality, the A50 gets the cake here. The display is huge and seems aimed at multimedia consumers. The P30 Lite, however, isn’t that far behind though! The IPS panel is sharp and vibrant and though it does not match the deep blacks of the Super AMOLED, you can’t call it bad!   Both of these phones have a U-shaped notch with a single camera up top.\xa0 And both look good, they are small and don’t hinder usage or media consumption, so, I don’t have a personal favorite here. But the bezels on the Galaxy A50 seem a bit more pronounced than the P30 Lite which you can notice right away. But all these are matters of preferences.  So, for the deep AMOLED blacks, I would go for the A50 despite the slightly pronounced bezels.  Cameras:  While testing both these cameras, the first thing in noticed was, both of them are not color accurate. Both of them have this extra punch to the pictures they produce and they are different in their own ways. It is kinda hard comparing both.   The P30 Lite comes with a triple camera set up at the back, a 24 MP primary camera, a, 8 MP ultra-wide angle lens and a 2 MP depth sensor while the A50 shows off a 25 MP primary lens, an 8MP ultra- wide angle lens and a 5 MP depth sensor.  So, let’s start with the details. Comparing both, I found the details to be slightly better on the Huawei P30 Lite. Not that A50 misses out on details, but P30 Lite’s pictures are a bit sharper. Maybe it’s the P30 Lite’s inbound photo sharpening mechanism, but it produces better details than its counterpart.

But here too, the P30 Lite’s details are better, if you look closely. Here are some samples for you to check out.

But if you look at these two images, the A50’s image is more saturated.

Similarly, portrait images also look better from the A50’s cameras with good levels of background blurring. Edge detection, on the other hand, is not good at both. However, in portrait images, colors seem lively on the P30 Lite. But, because of better background blurring, I will go for A50 in terms of portraits.

Like in daytime images, the night time images pack in more details. The colors are better too. There is a dedicated night mode in the P30 Lite that makes for even better details during a low light environment.      Galaxy A50 vs Huawei P30 lite night time pictures comparison   1  of 6               Huawei P30 Lite         Samsung Galaxy A50         Huawei P30 Lite         Samsung Galaxy A50         Huawei P30 Lite         Samsung Galaxy A50                              So, judging overall, the P30 Lite takes the cake in the camera department albeit by a small margin.  Check out high-resolution samples  here .  Performance  Talking of performance, the A50 is powered by the Exynos 9610 chipset while the P30 Lite gets the Kirin 710. And comparing the benchmark scores, the A50 is better by a good margin. But in real life usage, both fare well. Regular usage and multitasking are smooth on both. You will not feel any lags or stutters of any kind when it comes to regular use.  However, gaming on the A50 is slightly better. You can play PUBG on high settings as well with some stutters here and there. In the P30 Lite, however, you can play PUBG at medium settings at max which runs pretty good though. Small to mid-tier games do run well on both.  Having said that the P30 Lite offers you 6 GB RAM and 128 GB of storage while the Galaxy A50 gives you 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage.  To sum up, the A50 does a slightly better job in the performance.  Software and UI:   Both these phones run on their own versions of skin on top of Android. The A50 comes with Samsung’s new One UI while the P30 Lite rocks the EMUI 9. And choosing one was a tough job because both of these are well optimized in their games. Huawei’s EMUI has improved a lot than what we knew for it be while Samsung’s One UI is new and fresh.  What I really like about Samsung’s UI is the dark mode that helps lessen eye strain and it brings everything down for the user’s ease. Huawei’s does not provide that but it is simple and easy to navigate, so no complaints here. There is a bit of bloatware on both but many can be deleted so nothing much to worry about here as well.  But something I have noticed is OneUI is a bit sluggish. I mean, on a flagship phone it works pretty smooth but in mid-range phones, you can feel that it is not that optimized. But in Huawei’s case, EMUI is smooth and swift even on mid-range phones. So, for the swiftness, I would choose EMUI over OneUI.  Battery:  A good battery size on mid-range smartphones is a given these days. Likewise, is the case here. The Huawei P30 Lite comes with a 3,700 mAh battery while the A50 shows of a good- sized 4,000 mAh battery. Both the phones come equipped with Fast Charging Technology, 15-watt fast charging on the Galaxy A50 and 18-Watt fast charging on the Huawei P30 Lite.   In terms of battery, the A50 gives you a slight advantage. The A50 seems to last a tad bit longer than the P30 Lite because of its AMOLED display and a slightly larger battery. The P30 Lite, on the other hand, is no slouch. It lasts for an entire day but under heavy usage, you will experience the need to charge it at the end of the day. Similarly, the A50 will leave you with 20-30% juice after using it for an entire day.  Charging on the Huawei P30 Lite takes exactly one hour and 40 minutes while the A50 takes one hour and 48 minutes. Needless to say, the charging speeds are more or less similar on both.  Extras:  Okay, now extras. The Huawei P30 Lite has the same old fingerprint sensor at the back while the A50 has a modern in-display fingerprint sensor incorporated. But sadly, as modern as an in-display fingerprint sensor sounds, on the A50, it can be rather frustrating. It is very slow and takes a considerably longer time to unlock your device. While the old school rear-mounted fingerprint sensor on the P30 Lite is zippy fast and accurate.   The Face Unlock shares the same story. The A50’s is a little slower compared to P30 Lite’s. Not to a frustrating level but it’s still slower.  Call quality on both is fine. Speaker test of both the phones reveals that the A50 is louder than the P30 Lite. However, the P30 Lite’s audio is more balanced and it does not get distorted at the highest volumes. So, all in all, the Huawei P30 Lite rules the extras department.  Conclusion:  So, getting towards the conclusion, both these devices are very competitive when it comes to their offerings. But taking price into consideration, the A50 will cost you a little less and offers 4/64GB memory. While for a slightly more price, you can get 6/128 GB variant of the P30 Lite. And in the end, it all boils down to user preference. Having said that, you get the A50 for a slightly discounted price these days, so that might change your decision as well.  If your needs can be sufficed with slightly lesser memory, the A50 is a good deal, but if you want more memory and an ergonomic design, than the P30 Lite will do great for you.

Of course, even the biggest tech giants can face pressure. And in the light of recent events, there were reports of Huawei slowing down the production of its phone in some of the plants. A very recent report reported that  the smartphone giant cut off a part of its smartphone production at Foxconn plants  for the time being.  Sources claimed that the Taiwanese company is slowing down the production of Huawei phones as per the company’s orders.  However, after that news came out,  Huawei denied  that flat. The tech giant said that no such thing happened and  production is still at full capacity . There are also no further plans to slow down in the near future. They’ll probably go all out until they have the stockpile of chips as their claims.        At such a time, we’d expect the company to slow down and think things over. But it seems that the firm is not as badly affected by all these things. Or maybe, the company’s keeping a rock-solid front for morale. Either way, it seems the company’s goal hasn’t changed. Its goal is, still, to become the top smartphone brand in the market. Although, that might take a lot longer now.  Yet, Huawei is undeterred. And this should teach us all a life lesson, or two!

While that is in the air, Xiaomi is gearing up for another flagship device. It launched the  Xiaomi Mi 9  back in February. And now, it’s going to launch a follow-up device, the  Xiaomi Mi 9T .  Sounds so much like a OnePlus knock off just by the name, doesn’t it? But it’s actually a knock-off of the  Redmi K20 , actually! I wouldn’t say knock-off, but a remodeled version of the Redmi K20. After all, even though Redmi is a new company, it’s still Xiaomi’s! For all we know, it could actually only be renamed, with all other features being the same.         The Xiaomi Mi 9T will feature a  pop-up selfie camera  as opposed to the water-drop notch on the Mi 9. This further confirms that the Mi 9T is the Redmi K20. And since there is a Redmi K20 Pro as well, we expect a Pro model to accompany the Mi 9T too.  Furthermore, the Redmi K20 and K20 Pro might also launch as successors of the  Pocophone F1 . The new phones might launch as  Poco F2  and the  F2 Pro  in some markets. However, the Redmi K20 will keep its original moniker in India. So, it’s not sure which markets will get what.

['OPPO A1K Review: A for Aggressively average!'],"['OPPO', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['June 4, 2019']",2019-06-04 07:27:57+00:00,"['Is it just me or has OPPO’s smartphone lineup in Nepal gone a bit stale lately? What I mean is, there is very less versatility in their product lineup these days – apart from the  OPPO F11  and  F11 Pro , of course – they have something going, at least. But still, we could use some fresher products. Maybe that’s why the Oppo A1K is here. It’s targeted towards the  sub Rs 20,000 price segment . But with middling specs, a minimal feature set and an asking price of  Rs. 17,590,  is it worth your attention? Let’s find out in this Oppo A1k review.  OPPO A1K Specifications   Display : 6.1-inch IPS LCD HD+ display, 19.5:9 aspect ratio  CPU : MediaTek MT6762 Helio P22  GPU : PowerVR GE8320  OS : Android 9 Pie with ColorOS 6 on top  RAM : 2GB  Storage : 32GB, Expandable up to 256GB via dedicated SD card slot  Rear Camera : 8MP, f/2.2, 1/3.2″, 1.4µm, AF), LED flash  Front Camera : 5MP, f/2.0  Sensors : Accelerometer, Proximity, Compass  Battery : 4,000 mAh; Micro USB charging port  Price : Rs. 17,590   Design and Build  Starting off on a positive note, the OPPO A1K excels in this category. Sure it’s still plastic and has a cheap feel in the hands, but it’s sturdy and feels durable. I have no complaints on the design front. I even liked the red matte color scheme which, first off looks good, and isn’t a fingerprint magnet. Either way, using the clear case you get out the box is recommended. You also get a pre-applied screen protector over the  Gorilla Glass 3 display  up front.      Design and Build   1  of 4               Notch         Bottom         Left         Right                        Other than that, the water drop notch and those bezels place it on the same levels as its competition. The plain matte Red back with the OPPO branding and that single camera sensor aided by an LED flash is your typical budget phone look. The bottom holds the speakers, micro USB port, mic, and a headphone jack. On the right, you are greeted by a lonely power button and on the other side is the volume controller plus the SIM slot while the top remains empty.        Display   Its  6.1-inch display  with a screen to body ratio of a little over 80% is pretty decent. There’s isn’t significant bezels on the sides of the display, but the pretty huge chin is noticeable. But given it’s a budget phone it’s hard to complain about these types of shortcomings. Moving on to the actual panel, the HD resolution and that IPS technology is all but standard, but the actual display quality feels ok at best. It’s decently bright, produces punchy colors and the viewing angles are pretty good.  Camera  The single  8MP lens  didn’t really impress me much here. Details were acceptable in good lighting but produced grainy and muddy photos under harsh lighting while the color reproduction was average. In the end, the overall result was decent at best. Under low light conditions, the photos suffer from lack of detail.      Camera Samples   1  of 12               Normal Lighting                                                                 1x         Zoom         Low Light                                                While we have seen some phones produce good portraits with a single lens, that’s not the case here. The portraits it took were far from it. Edge detection is something that needs a lot of improvement, not to mention the blurs. Plus, the phone overexposes the background in portrait shots which makes those basically unusable.      Portrait    1  of 5               Portrait         Normal         Portrait         Normal         Low Light Portrait                           Moving on to the front, the  5MP shooter  managed to capture some acceptable selfies under well-lit conditions but again suffers under harsh lighting. Portraits are again, not very good, with lots of irregularities and missed edge detection. On top of that, the same overexposing problem for portraits carries on to the front camera as well.      Front Camera   1  of 6               Selfie                              Portrait selfie         Low Light Selfie                              Finally, for videos, it takes FHD@30fps and there is no stabilization on board. The quality is average. The videos can be used for memories but nothing more.  For high res images,  click here .  Performance & Software  The Oppo A1K comes with a  Helios P22 SoC  and  ColorOS 6.0  on top of Android Pie. For the given price, I would have loved to see OPPO put in a much better processor. First off, the A1k does not really belong in this price range. It’s a lot slower than its competition in both synthetic benchmarks, and in the real-world usage. I don’t mean to say the phone is bad. But it’s just that the competitors are offering much better hardware and this one doesn’t.  If we talk gaming, the first one I tried out was PUBG – at the lowest settings. It was enjoyable, with some stutters here and there. Clash of Clans was also playable (if you guys are still into it). Other mid-tier games like PH: Cruise and Real Cricket 19 also ran with lowered graphics quality. As for general apps like Facebook, Instagram, and other general apps, they will run without any problems.   I previously reviewed the OPPO F11 Pro, and that one also ran on the  ColorOS 6.0  over Android Pie. It was a pretty great experience and showed a lot of promise for future OPPO smartphones. Sadly, that feeling was shortlived when I went into the OPPO A1K with huge expectations and all of them were shattered. The phone felt sluggish, had a bunch of bloatware (which were removable), and the UI itself stutters every now and then.  That is, however, due to the hardware shortcomings rather than the software. Just like what happened with the  Redmi 6  after its MIUI 10 update.  OPPO A1K benchmark scores:   Geekbench 4 :  817 (Single Core Score)  3224 (Multi-Core Score)  2905 (RenderScript Score)    AndroBench :  280MB/s (Sequential read)  111MB/s (Sequential write)    PCMark : 4983 (Work 2.0 Performance score)   Battery  The battery, however, impresses thoroughly. Oppo does this thing with its budget phones where it gives them larger batteries, like the  Oppo A3s ! With a  4000mAh  battery, 2 days of normal usage was easy and that’s with all the power saving options turned off. I was never worried about charging this phone, but that’s what made its tediously long charging times bearable. It literally takes around  3 hours to get to 100% . I tried charging it with the 20W fast charger from the OPPO F11 Pro, and guess what? Same results. I guess this one  doesn’t support Fast Charging . On a side note, this phone comes with a 5V/2A charger out of the box.  Security and Extras  As for security features, this one lacks a fingerprint sensor. You can opt for face recognition but that’s pretty slow, to begin with. You do get the usual pattern and pin unlock, just like on every other Android phone out there. Apart from the security, you get a dedicated microSD slot while the phone itself comes with  32GB of internal storage . Speaker quality is nothing special and the same goes for call quality as well.  Conclusion   The OPPO A1K sports some satisfying design choices coupled with some amazing battery performance. But apart from that, there is very less reason to buy this phone. It offers aggressively mediocre performance, poor implementation of ColorOS 6 and an average display at best. And what makes it an even more of a bad deal is its competitors in the same price bracket.  The  Redmi 7  comes with more performance, similar battery life, and better cameras while retaining a fingerprint sensor. Then there is the much cheaper  Galaxy A10 , which might not hold its ground in the camera department but will surpass it in the performance department. It also has a better display and costs 3.5k less.  And you know what? With the recent  price decreases in Samsung’s smartphones , the  Galaxy M20  is available for less than this! And even so, it has a more pleasing high-res display, better camera(s), faster performance, larger battery (with fast charging) and is a true value for money smartphone. The Oppo A1K, despite being a decent budget phone, gets easily lost in the competition, with its unreasonable price.  OPPO A1K Pros and Cons  Pros   Huge Battery  Good Design   Cons   Sluggish Performance  No fingerprint sensor  Better Alternatives at this price']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/OPPO-A1K.jpg']

At the event, Apple announced two new devices, a new version of MacOS, iPadOS, iOS 13 and upgrades to Watch OS.  Mac Pro  So, after lots and lots of wait, Apple has finally launched the new Mac Pro. The device looks quite unique with its ‘cheese grater’ design. But the talking point lies on what’s inside.         The 2019 Mac Pro’s base model features the octa-core Intel Xeon W processor with 3.5 GHz clock speed which turbo boosts to 4 GHz. It comes with 32 GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal SSD. This product has the AMD Radeon Pro 850X as its graphics, and users can add up to four of these cards in the Mac Pro.  However, the star of the show is the maxed out variant of the product which is an absolute beast when it comes to specifications. This device has 1.5 TB of RAM and the 28-core Intel Xeon W processor. It comes with a dedicated AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo graphic card with 64 GB of graphics. This variant has a separate graphics accelerator as well.  The company didn’t announce the price of the Mac Pro but it is expected to be anywhere be $40,000 to $50,000 while the base model will go on sale for $5,999.  Apple Pro Display XDR   Apple also announced a 6K Retina display to match the Mac Pro. This device comes with a 31.6-inch screen with 6K resolution and it is HDR enabled. It has a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and features 1,000 nits of brightness. There is also a matte option for the monitor, but it will raise the price of the already-expensive monitor. This device will go on sale for $6,000 with the high specced model going for $12,000.  Apple will also launch a separate stand for this monitor which costs $1,000 alone.  iPadOS  Apple also unveiled the iPadOS – a new operating system that’s meant for iPads. This new OS will replace iOS on the tablets and will bring in features meant exclusively for iPads.

['Apple granted patent for a foldable device: A double-folding iDevice could be in the works'],['Apple'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 3, 2019']",2019-06-03 13:22:43+00:00,"['Samsung’s Galaxy Fold  and  Huawei’s Mate X  are the very first smartphones that feature a foldable screen. Although both of these devices are yet to make their way to the market, the tech incorporated on these devices has surely shown us a glimpse of the future. The Mate X is currently in the works whereas Samsung is mending the  issues found on the Galaxy Fold . At a time when these major players are indulged in fixing and polishing the folding technology, Apple seems to be getting started in the folding tech. Recently, the Cupertino-based company filed for a patent for folding phone and was granted as well. Unlike the Galaxy Fold and Mate X, this device will have a double folding screen.  The company had submitted a prototype last year in which the device folds in the middle. With that prototype, many had expected that a foldable iDevice could make it to the market ahead of others. But there is still no solid information regarding the progress of such folding machines.  Although only the patent for the double folding screen is currently making headlines, the company filed to protect both the single and multifold devices. The patent also includes a document with 37 drawings. The drawings show the technical features, folding configurations, and the working mechanism of all the folding configurations. It is also quite clear from the drawings about the rotating mechanism of the hinges when the screen on the device folds and unfolds. The source claims that the folding screen can go from a 180-degree angle to 90-degree angle.              1  of 3                                                Another image also appeared on the internet, which shows that the screen can be folded backward so as to form a triangle. When the screen is balanced on two edges, the same contents can be viewed on both the divided screens.   Further details also revealed that the flexible cover layer on such devices would be made up of ceramic material like glass, strengthened glass, sapphire, and Zirconia. This could ensure better protection for the flexible display from impact or other potentially damaging contacts. If Apple could implement this, it might overcome the damaging issues found on the Galaxy Fold and could be even more reliable.  The patent reveals many technical details of the folding device. However, it’s still unclear whether the tech giant will implement this tech on its iPhones or iPads. The upcoming iPhones are slated to launch on October 2019 and there is just a few months for the company to work on. So it’s highly unlikely that Apple could launch a foldable iPhone this year. Also, these are just the schematics for the patents. So the upcoming iDevices may have a slightly or completely different design when it makes its way to the market.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/foldable-iPhone-apple-granted-patent.jpg']
['DJI Osmo Action now available for purchase in Nepal: An action camera with two displays'],"['Action Camera', 'DJI']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 3, 2019']",2019-06-03 10:43:01+00:00,"['DJI is the leading company when it comes to the camera equipment and accessories like  drones (UAVs) , quad-copters,  gimbals , and so on. Because of the handy features packed into the device and due to their versatility, DJI products are widely used in the cinema industry and is fairly used by other content creators as well. And recently, the Chinese tech company expanded its lineup with an action camera, the  DJI Osmo Action . It is the first action camera from the company and the very first one to come with two displays. With the dual-display feature, the action cam received applauds from many. And after receiving praises from the international market, this camera has finally made its way to Nepal.   Buy DJI Osmo Action Here   DJI Osmo Action Overview:  As I already mentioned, the action cam flaunts  dual displays . It comes with a display both on both the front and on the back. And it’s what set the Osmo Action apart from all the action cameras out there. The device packs a  2.25-inch colored touch-screen  on the back and a  1.4-inch colored display  in the vicinity of the camera lens on the front. So, making use of the front display, one can easily capture selfies or do vlogging. Since Vloggers and content creators are quite on the rise these days, this camera may turn out handy among such populace.  On to the optics part, the device comes with a  1/2.3-inch sensor , which can capture  12MP images . It is the same sensor, which was used on  DJI’s Mavic Air drone .\xa0 Video wise, you can record  4K movies up to 60fps . In order to ensure better stabilization in the videos, DJI has also incorporated DJI’s proprietary  Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) technology . The EIS technology in the Osmo Action goes by the name of RockSteady.         The device is also capable of recording HDR (High Dynamic Range) videos in Ultra-HD or 4K resolution. However, it can only capture  4K HDR videos at 30fps .  DJI has also included some fancy camera features in the device. The Action Cam is also capable of recording  slo-mo (up to 8x)  and  time-lapse  videos. There is also an option to tweak into the exposure level. So the users can record movies on their exposure settings according to their liking. And there is DJI’s proprietary feature SnapShot. The SnapShot feature allows the camera to turn on and begin recording in under two seconds by pressing the shutter button once.  To support the users for taking underwater shots, DJI has also encased the device with the waterproof housing. You can be used up to  11 meters under the surface of the water . If you put on a waterproof casing, you can go deep up to  60 meters . But while doing so, you need to make sure that you seal the flap that covers the USB-C port and Micro SD card slot before diving in the water.  Unlike the GoPro Hero 7 Black, the DJI Osmo Action doesn’t come with an HDMI port. So the real-time monitoring of the recording videos on bigger screens is not quite possible here. But you can connect the device with DJI’s mobile app on the phone and watch the videos with it. In doing so, you won’t be obliged to monitor the recording videos on the tiny screen on the device.  As far as the battery is concerned, the action cam comes aboard with a removable battery with  1300mAh capacity . And this battery promises to deliver a backup for  93 minutes while recording 4K/30fps movies  with the RockSteady feature turned on. You can also prolong the battery life up to  135 minutes by recording at 1080p/30fps  without RockSteady.  Talking about the price, the DJI Osmo Action demands  Rs. 48,000  on the purchase. Since it packs more and fancy features than the  GoPro Hero 7 Black (Rs. 51,500)  and still cost less, the Action Cam looks like it’s worth attention. What do you say? Can it help the vloggers and content creators to unleash the new potential? Let us know in the comments.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dji-osmo-action.jpg']

And as much as the series made headlines, we didn’t see many variants in it like the A-series. But now we have official news that the  Samsung  Galaxy M40  will launch in India on the 11 th  of June.  We can see on  Amazon’s Indian website  that the company has partnered with Samsung for the launch of it’s new M-series smartphone, the M40. All the pictures on Amazon’s website clearly show how the upcoming smartphone will look. It’ll sport an  Infinity-O display , something just like its flagship brother’s, the  Galaxy S10e  and  Galaxy S10 .         Images on Amazon.in show that the Galaxy M40 will sport a triple camera setup. And one of them will be ultra- wide-angle lens. Additionally, the phone will come bearing  Snapdragon 600-series processor , which I’m guessing is the Snapdragon 675. After all, that’s the best SD600 series processor right now. With this, the company has hinted for the phone have a stellar performance along with sporting a triple camera setup.  Having said all this, there are leaks of the phone coming with Snapdragon 675 chipset paired with  6 GB RAM , too. This only confirms our guesses even further. The device will run on  Android Pie  with One UI on top. The primary lens on the triple camera setup will have  32 MP resolution  whereas the selfie shooter can be a  16 MP unit . The specs of the other two cameras are still in the dark.  The fingerprint sensor, however, is located at the back just like the M20. So, no in-display fingerprint scanner for cheap just like the  Galaxy A50 .   It’s impressive that unlike other members of the M- series, this one has gone for a better and more appealing approach with the cameras and choice of processor. The phone is expected to have a price tag of  INR 20,000!  That makes this M40 not-so-budget phone. It’s also Rs. 2000 more than the most expensive member of the M-series at present date. Still, since the Galaxy M30 didn’t launch in Nepal, we can’t say much about its availability here, either.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/samsung-galaxy-m40-leaks-3.jpg']
['MSI GE75 Raider 9SF Review – The Gaming Laptop Benchmark'],"['MSI', 'GE series', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['June 3, 2019']",2019-06-03 05:55:52+00:00,"['MSI – does it even need any introduction? When it comes to gaming laptops, it takes its place in the top tier leagues. And out of all the laptops we’ve reviewed of MSI’s…this one, right here, is my favorite. The  MSI GE75 Raider 9SF ! This one packs the latest and the best of everything, and probably sets a benchmark for gaming laptops (at this price range).  What I mean by the latest and the best of everything is that it comes with a 9 th -gen CPU and an RTX 2070 graphics. This combo makes it a gaming force to be reckoned with. Of course, its highest variant also comes with an RTX 2080, but I had such a great experience with this, I don’t think anyone would have to pay extra for that. And how does this one fare? Let’s see.         MSI GE75 Raider 9SF Specifications:   Design and Build:  Matte Aluminum body, Polycarbonate bottom panel, 39.7 x 26.85 x 2.75 cm, 2.65 kg  Display:  17.3″ Full HD IPS-Level Panel (1920 x 1080 resolution), 100% sRGB & 74% Adobe RGB, 69% NTSC Color Gamut, 300 nits peak brightness with Anti-Glare, 144 Hz Refresh Rate, 3 milliseconds response time  Keyboard:\xa0 Steel-Series Engine 3 Keyboard, Per-key RGB backlighting, 16 million colors, 1.6 mm key travel  Processor:  Hexa-core 9 th  gen i7-9750H processor, Base-Clock @ 2.6 GHz, Turbo Boost Clock up to 4.5 GHz  RAM:  DDR4 16 GB. Dual Channel (2 X 8 GB) (Upgradeable up to 64 GB)  Graphics:  8 GB NVidia GeForce RTX 2070 GDDR6  Battery:  6-cell 51 Watt-hours (up to 2 hours of backup)  Adapter:\xa0 280 Watts  Storage:  512 GB NVMe PCIe Gen 3 SSD (2x SSD slots) + 1 TB SATA HDD  Webcam :\xa0 720p Webcam (@30fps)  Connectivity:  Killer Gb LAN, Killer 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v5  Ports:\xa0 3 x USB A 3.1, 1 x USB-C (No Thunderbolt 3 support), 1 x 3.5 mm headphone jack, 1 x 3.5mm microphone input, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Mini-display, 1 x RJ-45 Ethernet, 1 x SDcard slot  Price:  Rs. 300,000    Buy Here   Performance  So, right off, the performance is stellar! The  9 th  gen Hexa Core i7-9750H  gives you a performance  boost of about 400 MHz  from that of the i7-8750H. That’s about a 20% boost, which is a considerable upgrade. And that means higher clock speeds – both on the base clock as well as Turbo. If you don’t understand what that means, don’t worry. Just remember that your 8750H was capable of squeezing quite a lot of performance…and this one does it even better! Kind of an overkill for an average gamer, if you think about it.   I ran Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects, and Premiere Pro simultaneously just to test it, and apart from a slight delay time in loading all of them, there was no performance hiccup. I’ve had over 30 tabs open on Google Chrome, and there was no freezing or lagging. Of course, that’s partly due to the  Dual Channel 16 GB RAM  and the fast  512 GB NVMe SSD as well.  Apps load fairly quickly too. And if that 512 GB storage wasn’t enough, you also get a 1  TB Hard Disk Drive ! Sweet, right?   Read Speed:  1663.3 MB/s  Write Speed:  1451.1 MB/s   As for the gaming performance, this one has set the benchmark for me. I played highly graphics intensive games like  Battlefield V  and  Metro Exodus  and both of them ran pretty smooth in my time. However, I didn’t really test it on low-end games, because well – if it can run these most intensive games, then, it will surely run other games easy.  And playing Battlefield V on it has been one of the best gaming experiences for me. With the RTX or Ray Tracing on, I was getting about 73 frames per second on average, and about 84 fps peak. And that was on the Highest settings possible. With the RTX Off, I got about 110 frames per second on average, and 144, peak! That…is quite a lot! And since I can barely make out any difference with the RTX On and RTX Off, I chose to play the game with it turned off.  Metro Exodus, however, didn’t fare as well as Battlefield V. You can actually play it with RTX on Ultra, RTX on High and RTX Off. However, there wasn’t much difference between the two. I got about 65 fps on average on RTX Ultra and something like 70 fps on RTX High settings. And due to its dark game settings, it makes more sense to play the game with RTX Off. However, as strange as it may seem, the frame rates with RTX Off were considerably low…reaching about 60 fps on average.  But that could be the thermals acting up as well. Because by that time, I had been gaming about for hours, and the CPU temperatures were exceeding 102-degrees Centigrade! So, I guess, there was some thermal throttling too. I then, turned the fans to its max, and it did help somewhat, but I didn’t face this problem on Battlefield V, so, I don’t know what to make of it.  Nevertheless, the gaming experience has been, by far, the best, in my tests, of course. And what helps the gaming experience immensely is the display and the speakers. I initially used to complain about the speakers on MSI gaming laptops, and with the cooler boost fans on, the speakers weren’t audible. But this time, MSI has included what it calls “ Giant Speakers ”! And Giant it is! It’s really loud and fires some great audio.  Display   The large  17.3” IPS LCD display  with Full HD resolution,  144 Hz Refresh rate and 3 milliseconds of response time  is another appealing factor about this laptop. Of course, that is nothing new for MSI laptops, but still, the large display with decent viewing angles helps a lot. It claims about  100% of sRGB …there’s  69% NTSC Color Gamut Coverage  and  74% Adobe RGB . And that is decent enough for your content creation needs too. Plus, there’s  MSI’s True Color  which switches color modes according to necessity.  Keyboard and Trackpad   On to the keyboard, it’s a pretty standard  Steel Series Engine 3  keyboard with the individual key backlighting, which we all like so much. As usual, you can program each key to light up a specific way. But that takes a lot of time, so, I didn’t. But there are various color modes on the keyboard to go with your mood, and there are  4 levels of backlighting , too. Besides the lights show… the keyboard is great. Keys are well spaced and give good tactile feedback. Keyboard travel is also very nice, and typing on it will not feel like a drag.      MSI GRaider 9SF Keyboard & Trackpad   1  of 2               Keyboard         Trackpad                  The trackpad too is about the same. Tracking feels nice and smooth, and the gestures are highly accurate. There are nice physical clicky buttons on them, and I liked the trackpad fairly well.  Ports      MSI GE75 Raider 9SF ports   1  of 2               Left         Right                  Port selection is pretty nice. You get  three USB-As , a  USB-C  (without Thunderbolt 3 support),  an HDMI , a  MiniDisplay port , an  SDCard slot ,  RJ-45 Ethernet  and an  Audio-in and Audio-out ports.  Design and Build  Let’s come to the design now…and the design on this MSI GE75 Raider 9SF is refreshed, to say the least. The design on this one is visibly different from other Raider series laptops, like the  MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8SF . It moves to a  matte-finish aluminum build  this time while the bottom panel seems to be polycarbonate. But even so, there’s a minimal amount of flex on the keyboard deck.      MSI GE75 Raider 9SF Design   1  of 6                      Lid         Bottom Panel         Front (Closed)         Max Open Angle         Vents (Back)                              And aesthetically, there has been lots of improvement in this Raider laptop. The whole design looks better, maybe it’s the kind of super-car design up front or the ridiculously  slim bezels on a gaming laptop  of this caliber. And even with such slim bezels, they managed to put the webcam on top. However, the webcam, as usual, is not good at all. But since this one is a monster of a laptop, it also weighs like  2.65 kg without the charger . And I think the charger alone adds nearly a kilogram! So, portability is…eh!   Another thing that put me off is the matte finish aluminum panel attracts quite a lot of fingerprints. And they’re also pretty difficult to get rid of. So, there’s that.  Battery   However, the only disappointing thing about this laptop is the battery. With a  51-Watt-hour battery , the juice doesn’t last as long as you’d expect. Not even 2.5 hours on normal usage, which was usual for other MSI laptops. This one barely gives you 2 hours on regular usage and about 30 minutes on gaming.  Conclusion  So, the  MSI GE75 Raider 9SF  is a great gaming laptop for sure. You get the latest of the processor and the graphics, plenty of memory, storage and great speakers. The display is pretty decent and the refreshed design only adds to its niceties. You can also easily upgrade the RAM up to 64 GB as there are dual slots in there.  I only have a small complaint in the battery department, but since gaming laptops tend to be like this, there’s very less to say in this matter.  And this is a laptop that costs like  $2200 internationally . Of course, it depends on the configuration available, and there are quite a lot of them. For that price, I don’t know if it’s a good deal or not, but here in Nepal, it certainly is, for the price of  Rs. 300000 ! And this is the official price, so, you get all the guarantees and warranties you could need. For me, this one has been the gaming laptop benchmark so far, and I’d certainly recommend this for buying!  Pros and Cons  Pros:   Great gaming power  Abundant storage  Amazing sound quality (Commendable Speaker)  Refreshed design   Cons:   Poor battery life. It could have been better.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/msi-ge75-raider-9sf-review.jpg']
['Excise duty on smartphones decreases by 50% and Samsung was the first one to react'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 2, 2019']",2019-06-02 13:06:42+00:00,"['Mobile phones are usually expensive in Nepal . It can clearly be noticed when the international price and the price of the same device in Nepal are compared. The main reason for that was the inclusion of 13% VAT on every mobile phone imported to Nepal. The government further imposed an additional 5% excise duty last year. So the importers had to pay quite a lot of taxes to the government. Since those tax amounts are levied on the selling price of smartphones, it was enough to create a steep increase in the price. But in the recent Annual Budget Speech for fiscal year 2076/77, Finance Minister Dr. Yubaraj Khatiwada announced to decrease the excise duty by 50%. That means for all the upcoming phones imported to Nepal, the importers/NDs have to pay just 2.5% excise duty. The VAT, however, still remains at 13%. As soon as the government announced that, Samsung abruptly stepped up and slashed the prices of its various mobile devices.  The Scenario  Previously, the government was levying only 13% VAT on every mobile device that supported cellular connectivity and wireless telecommunication. And at the end of the year, the government used to offer a 40% rebate at the end of the fiscal year. So the importers or the National Distributors (NDs) have to pay a net of 7.8% on the taxes. But last year, the Finance Minister Khatiwada announced to stop providing 40% rebate. And declared to further impose an excise duty of 5%. That makes a grand total of 18.65% on the taxes. A sudden rise from 7.8% to 18.65% on the tax created quite a surge in the price. So the importers and NDs were obliged to raise the prices on mobile phones.  Due to such a steep increase in price, most of the users were attracted to the gray market, which offers the same product for a lesser price. And that could be the reason why the smartphone import through the authorized channels decreased by 50% in the fiscal year 2075/76. So to lure customers into buying through the authorized channels and to ease the importers on the taxes, the government decide to slash the excise duty by 50% for the fiscal year 2076/77. This resulted in a reduction in the tax rates from 18.65% down to 15.83%.        The Aftermath  At a time, where the implementation of such announcements take place at a languid pace, Samsung strode up and slashed the prices on its various smartphones overnight. And Samsung was the first one to do so. Since the capable smartphones are really expensive these days, the gesture shown by Samsung to ease customers’ inconvenience (in financial terms) is really laudable. We hope, more of the smartphone brands will also follow Samsung’s footsteps and decrease the price of the mobile phones in their lineup.  And by the way, here is the revised price list of various Samsung devices before and after the price drop.

Here, we compare three premium mid-rangers:  Samsung Galaxy A70  vs  Vivo V15 Pro  vs  Oppo F11 Pro . So, which one is the best? Let’s find out.   Design  Let’s start with how they look. All three devices appear to have glass backs, and for the price, it is expected as well. But none of them do. They  all have plastic construction . And although Samsung calls their construction “Glastic”, it feels the same. Maybe an extra point on the slightly new construction, but again, the  A70 feels a bit cheaper in the hands , compared to these two.         Oppo F11 Pro and Vivo V15 Pro have, more or less, the same construction. And they don’t have a notch up front, going for the Pop-up cameras instead, which is a new and somewhat cool technology. So, they win.      Samsung Galaxy A70 vs Vivo V15 Pro vs Oppo F11 Pro design   1  of 4               Back         Ports         Left         Right                        But between these two, I like the color better on the Oppo F11 Pro. And if you choose the  Marvel edition , well, it’s no contest! So, Oppo F11 Pro wins the design and build.  Display   Here, Oppo loses the hand right away because  it’s the only one with an IPS LCD panel  while the  other two sport Super AMOLED . Now, of course, that doesn’t mean the F11 Pro’s display is bad…it’s just not as good as the other two.   Between the other two, the  A70 gets a taller 6.7-inch display,  which makes for a better multimedia experience. It comes with a tiny U-notch, but that is forgivable. And while the V15 Pro comes with a true full-screen display, the  colors on the A70 are simply better . Plus, Samsung is always on top when it comes to displays, so, it wins this round.  Performance  As for the performance,  all these phones pack 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage . The  V15 Pro and the A70 run on Snapdragon 675 , whereas the  F11 Pro runs on the slightly inferior Helio P70 .  And between these, the  Snapdragon 675 stands as the clear winner . If you need proof, the benchmark scores are there for you to see. And in these three, too, the V15 Pro leads by a very little amount.      Geekbench 4 Test  Samsung Galaxy A70  Vivo V15 Pro  Oppo F11 Pro    Single-core  2394  2397  1567    Multi-core  6485  6608  5960     \xa0     AnTuTu 7  Samsung Galaxy A70  Vivo V15 Pro  Oppo F11 Pro    Scores  168559  179379  148475     \xa0     Androbench  Samsung Galaxy A70 (MB/s)  Vivo V15 Pro (MB/s)  Oppo F11 Pro (MB/s)    Sequential Read  509.66  300.99  295.05    Sequential Write  192.27  176.64  190.16    Random Read  129.22  66.07  78.16    Random Write  22.99  63.12  17.11      But benchmarks are not the full story. To compare the performance, we also did a speed test of these phones. Here, the F11 Pro takes the longest to load the apps. While the loading time is, more or less, similar to the other two.  We finished loading a set of apps, and reopened them, again, in reverse order, as these speed tests go. And we found that the RAM management was better on the V15 Pro. It didn’t reload any of the apps, including heavy games like PUBG either. The A70, on the other hand, reloaded some heavy apps like PUBG and Subway Surfers. However, it was the worst on the F11 Pro, as it reloaded many of the apps – even ones like Fruit Ninja and such!   However, in the Read / Write speeds, the A70 is the better one, here. But considering the other benchmarks, and RAM management, this round goes to the V15 Pro.  Software and UI  In terms of software, however, the clear winner is the Galaxy A70. It comes with the new One UI, and it’s a lot better than the UI of the other two. It gives you a cleaner user experience, better navigation, and lesser bloatware.  Oppo’s ColorOS and Vivo’s FunTouch OS are both pretty heavy and don’t provide as good of user experience. While  Oppo fixed its UI to allow swiping to cross-out notifications , Vivo’s is still a clone to the iOS…and a half-baked iOS at that! So, you can see why One UI, even with its slightly cartoonish UI, is the best among these.  Security  Now to the security. In this department, the A70 and the V15 Pro come with in-display fingerprint scanners while the F11 Pro features a physical rear-mounted sensor. And as it is with physical sensors, the F11 Pro’s is blazing fast and highly accurate. It unlocks your phone instantly.  But the V15 Pro isn’t bad either. Its in-display fingerprint sensor can unlock the phone fast. That is a tad bit slower than the F11 Pro, but still pretty fast.  And then, there’s the A70. This one didn’t seem to really think about including a faster sensor here, at all. It takes around a second to unlock the device, and that is really frustrating. Even its Face Unlock is slower compared to the other two devices. So, the A70 is out.  Among the other two, however, it’s the F11 Pro that’s the fastest in unlocking. But since the V15 Pro is not behind, and employs a newer, more advanced tech in it, the point goes to the V15 Pro.  Battery  Let’s compare juices now. The  V15 Pro packs a good sized 3700  mAh battery while the  F11 Pro has a large 4000 mAh  unit. But, both offer similar backup and similar charging speeds. But the one on its own league is the A70. It has got a  huge 4500 mAh battery , and that too, with a  25-Watt Adaptive Fast charging . The battery lasts almost 2 days on single charge and charges from 0 to full in around 1 and half hours. So, it’s the clear winner in this aspect.  Camera   Lastly, the cameras. And these, have been, by far the most difficult aspect to compare in these phones. But we’ve tried our best, and here are the results.      Galaxy A70 vs F11 Pro vs V15 Pro   1  of 6               A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro                              Take a look at a few of these images, here. Now, if we surf through some samples, you can see that the images from the F11 Pro and the V15 Pro are slightly oversaturated, while the A70 gives you washed out colors.        1  of 9               Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro                                       The over-saturation is more pronounced on the V15 Pro. It may be the result of over-processing or something, but sometimes, it gives you pictures so highly oversaturated, that you kinda don’t wanna look at them!        1  of 9               Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro                                       But, in some scenarios, the popped-colors look a lot better. Of course, it can result in unnatural looking images, but sometimes, it looks very pleasing to the eye. Also, the V15 Pro nails the details, sometimes, outdoing the other two phones, as well.        1  of 3               Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro                     If we compare the F11 Pro side by side, the details are on par with the V15 Pro, but the images are mostly flawed by this greenish-tint to them. Maybe that’s why photos with green sceneries appear to be livelier on this one. \xad\xad      Colors   1  of 6               Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro                              The A70, as I already said, produces washed out colors – sometimes, to the point that it loses the colors. If you look at this tree here, the purple flowers don’t even appear purple! But it is also capable of maintaining a more uniform color distribution, though.      Portrait image comparison   1  of 6               Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro                              As for portraits, A70 has better blurs on the bokeh effect, but again, suffers from faded colors. V15 Pro over processes them and brings saturated colors. But the F11 Pro, overall, has better colors, details and edge detection in this scenario.      Low Light Sample   1  of 3               Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro                     In low light mode, however, it’s the V15 Pro that takes the cake.      Selfie   1  of 9               Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro         Galaxy A70         F11 Pro         V15 Pro                                       In terms of selfies, the F11 Pro and V15 Pro outshine the A70. The skin textures and colors look almost lost in the A70 while the other two preserve them quite well. Here, too, the V15 Pro tends to over-saturate images, which, I admit, can look pleasing to the eye sometimes. But it makes up for that in terms of details, in which, it outperforms the other two.  So…yeah…there’s no exact conclusion in the camera department. And as I said, it has been really tricky to test out the cameras. And the results don’t point to a clear winner. It’s a mixed bag of emotions.  All of them try to do what they do best – V15 tries to give you vibrant colors, the A70 goes for a uniform color distribution while the F11 Pro can give you better photos of human subjects. So, there’s that.  Conclusion  And not only in the camera department, but there also doesn’t seem to be a clear winner in all the other aspects, rounded up. F11 Pro has a better look and feel, which matters to a lot of people. The A70 has the best display, and battery. V15 Pro gives you the best performance and better security.  Each of them has their own sets of pros and cons. So, it’s not easy to choose a clear winner, here. You can, however, look at all the aspects, decide which one matters to you the most, and pick your phone.  This has been the battle of the premium mid-rangers: Samsung Galaxy A70 vs Vivo V15 Pro vs Oppo F11 Pro. So, which one would you prefer? Let us know in the comments.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Samsung-Galaxy-A70-vs-Vivo-V15-Pro-vs-Oppo-F11-Pro.jpg']
['Amazon Echo Show 5 – Smart speakers are getting affordable!'],['Amazon'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['June 2, 2019']",2019-06-02 10:37:51+00:00,"['Smart speakers are gaining quite the momentum these days. It seems every other company is trying to get one of theirs into the market. We already have Google Home Hub,  Huawei’s AI Cube , and a bunch of others. Amazon has been in this line for a long time now, and its Echo Show lineup is the most popular among their lineup. And, Amazon decided to launch another – the  Amazon Echo Show 5 , with an affordable price tag.  Amazon Echo Show 5 Overview  This Echo Show 5 is a bit smaller and looks cuter than the Echo Show. It’s got a  5.5″ screen , with a  960 x 480 resolution . Of course, smart speakers with displays haven’t been around that long comparatively, but they, too are getting popular. Because you can do quite a bit with a screen on board, after all.  The display resolution and the size make it like a phone on your table-stand, but of course, you’re not going to use it for doing phone things. This is just an assistant to watch Wiki-How videos for doing simple tasks. It  doesn’t support YouTube  or any other mainstream video streaming sites. You can, however, watch videos from Amazon Prime or its partner outlets like CNN. Also, you can video call someone who has the  Amazon Echo Show  or the  Echo Spot  as well. Furthermore, it can show you lyrics if you’re playing music on it. And along with Bluetooth support for audio out, there’s a USB port too.         Now, of course, the Echo Show 5 is an affordable smart speaker, so, there are a lot of cutdowns. There’s only one speaker, the screen size is almost half, and the  camera resolution is only 1 MP  now. Oh, and yeah, it still retains the physical shutter to cover the camera so that you don’t have to worry about being spied upon.  Furthermore, if you’re worried about privacy, i.e. Amazon recording your data, then, there are a couple of noteworthy features. You  can delete all your history of the day  just by saying “ Alexa, delete everything I said today”.\xa0 This will, of course, clear your history of the day. In addition, there’s also an  “Alexa, Delete what I just said”\xa0 feature. Of course, we can’t be assured that it won’t back it up…but hey, it’s a peace of mind.  Price and Availability  The Amazon Echo Show 5 is priced at a  very affordable $90 . This undercuts the more expensive $140 Google Home Hub, too. But of course, that has more features and aesthetically better. You can buy it now on Amazon.  This product will also  launch in India for about INR. 9000 . It will support local content from Hungama, JioSaavn, Gaana, Hungama Music, TuneIn, etc. along with Amazon Music.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/amazon-echo-show-5.jpg']
['The Real Victims of the US-Huawei Tech War'],"['Huawei', 'Opinion']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['June 1, 2019']",2019-06-01 16:17:53+00:00,"['So, by now, you are probably aware of the current events between the US, Huawei, and China. If you don’t, you can check out our insight  here . But since it’s the hot topic in the tech industry, I doubt you don’t know about it. Long story short, Huawei, is going through some tough times right now. The company  lost its license to use Android, the ARM chip architecture, and its privilege to influence decisions regarding Wireless technology and SD cards . Basically, the Trump administration is not allowing any US firms to trade with Huawei, as it is in their “Entity List”, citing some security reasons.  Not only that, but the US is also encouraging its Allies to ban Huawei’s technology – not only mobile phones and equipment but also their 5G claiming it poses security threats to their countries! That may or may not be, but so far there is no evidence of it. Yet, Trump Administration is rallying behind these reasons claiming Huawei to be stealing military information, intellectual property and spying on others through their 5G infrastructure.  The US Authorities have a dozen criminal charges on the company. But without any kind of proof , it is looking more like a sly move in the broad US-China Trade War.         If you don’t know what that is, well, it’s basically, tensions growing between the two largest economies in the world. The US is number one, while China is second. And China’s economy is growing so rapidly that I think Trump is actually scared. Otherwise, you can’t justify the reasons behind all this escalation! From banning one of the top technology firms like Huawei to restricting a lot of things, it’s going nuts! And even though Huawei is one of the largest players in technology in the world, it relies heavily on US support in many aspects.  Without that, Huawei is, for now, in a fix. Of course, a company like that has all the means and resources necessary to develop their own technology. But that takes time, and until they do, they will have to struggle. But that’s only one part of the story. Even IEEE,  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers publishing group decided to ban Huawei employees from editing its papers ! This is just absurd…because IEEE is responsible for working with scientists and professors from all over the world to help advance the world’s technology. And Huawei has multiple employees within the IEEE, but now, they can no longer contribute to their papers.   Now, a part of this US-China Trade War, or Tech War, whatever you would like to call it, is the  5G Race . And as far as the world is concerned, China is leading. They have all the necessary infrastructures in place, and their 5G tech is more advanced and more affordable. In addition, they’re helping many developing countries with their technology. They already have agreements even with the Nepali government to implement 5G in the near future! They’re clearly winning this race.  But the Trump administration is bent on not letting this happen. This is about money and power. And the US, being US, will not let anyone beat it, by any means necessary it seems. Banning Huawei of the most crucial elements it needs to build its infrastructure, US is trying to stop Huawei in its tracks. They’re playing dirty, but what’s more appalling is this won’t help the US develop advanced tech overnight! Stalling Huawei won’t help their development. This means  they’re just stalling the overall evolution of technology  – slowing down the development of whole mankind, in a way!  That…escalated quickly! But this is the whole point, actually. Because there’s a lot of politics involved here – from cornering a private company by imposing accusations without proof and influencing other countries to do the same. And a private company suffering from this is only the surface.  The real losers will be us  – the consumers and the general populace.  Also, there are small firms and startups, both in and outside the US, that rely on affordable tech like China’s to grow themselves. And those inside the US will be severely be affected by this ban, too. And who knows? Maybe one such small startup could be an innovator in the future? However, that might very well not be now. Because of this game the Trump administration is hell-bent on playing.  Okay, …forgive me for going a bit too overboard here. But one of my favorite inspirations, Carl Sagan said,  “To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known. ” .  All that we know and all that we will, in our lifetime, will take place in this very place. In this world of ours, Humanity has got this far due to our advancement in technology. And we’ve still a long way to go.  And this, right here, is a setback for the humankind as a whole. Technological advancement will be slowed down considerably. Not only will consumers lose a great phone brand, but 5G, which promises to take human innovation to new heights.  Okay, let’s say Huawei might be able to find a workaround soon about the tech it’s not receiving from the US. But why ban Huawei employees from such an organization as the IEEE? And because of this act, a senior IEEE member, professor Zhang from Peking University is resigning from the IEEE itself. To lose such personalities from the tech field is a loss for all of us.  Again, I might be out of place here. But all I’m saying is,  this trade war between two countries and a lot of egos mixed in there somewhere , is a huge loss for all of us. Technology should be treated as a separate entity, indifferent from the politics and ego of the powerful few. Of course, when you invent any technology of your own, then you can patent it and do whatever you want with it. But this is 5G…it belongs to the whole world! This should not suffer because someone somewhere cannot keep up with what the other guy is doing…  This is just sad, and an act worth condemning. Of course, China has its own answer for the US now. Chinese media reports that the country might restrict exporting essential earth minerals to the US. This means that the US will lose about 80% of its necessary raw materials to create other technology – from camera lenses to car engines and almost everything there is. We don’t know if this will, indeed happen, because China’s goal was to portray the US as a “lawless actor” hindering technological advancement. But considering how the Trump Administration is cornering one company and escalating the trade war, can we blame them?  In the end, this is just sad. Such big superpowers should be supporting each other for the betterment of all of us. But no, this is more about money and power rather than human advancement. And due to such corporate greed, we, the consumers and the general population will be the real losers!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-and-P30-Pro-review.jpg']

Based on a 10nm process, these chips are targeted towards lightweight ultra-books (for now). The 9th Gen H-series processors, used on powerful laptops, are still pretty new to the market so don’t expect Intel to refresh those anytime soon.  Codenamed “Ice Lake”, they feature a new Gen11 graphics, native ThunderBolt 3 support and built-in WiFi 6 (a new WiFI tech) among other things. Originally Intel planned to launch its processor with the 10nm process in 2015, but they are finally here now. The 10nm process offers much faster performance and better battery life – features ideal for ultra-books. With the new 10nm tech on its sleeves, Intel plans to launch a total of 11 different CPUs in the coming days.  Ice Lake  Like the previous generations of U and Y-processors, the company will categorize them to three divisions, i.e the Core i3, i5, and the Core i7. All of them will feature 4 cores and 8 threads, with TDP options of 9W, 15W and 28W. The Turbo Frequency for these chips maxes out at 4.1GHz while the cache size tops out at 8MB.

All of these chips are based on the new Sunny Cove architecture. With an IPC improvement of 18%, it’s a huge leap as compared to what we’ve seen in the past.  Gen 11 GPU  While all this was great, Intel was more keen on showing us their new integrated Iris Plus Graphics. Intel is promising over 2x boost in graphics performance thanks to their new Gen 11 GPU. With up to 1 TeraFlops of graphics performance under its belt, this new GPU overshadows some dedicated offerings from Nvidia like the MX110 (0.51), MX130 (0.95) only to be beaten by the MX150 (1.17) by a mere 0.05 TFLOPs.

The Moto Z4 is a mid-range smartphone, and it continues the ‘modular’ legacy of the Moto mods. The launch event comes after the leak fiasco where Motorola listed this device on  Amazon  and actually shipped it to a customer.  Moto Z4 Overview  The Moto Z4 is a 6.4-inch phone that features an OLED screen with full HD resolution and a 19:9 aspect ratio. This display has a waterdrop notch on the top of the display and it houses the selfie camera. Other than that, users get a bezel-less experience on the phone. For protection against drop and scratches, Motorola has included the older Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which for the price looks outdated.         The Moto Z4 features a single camera lens at the back. The 48-megapixel camera has an f/1.7 aperture and follows the same  pixel binning  for 12-megapixel image output. According to Motorola, the Z4’s camera app will also come with a night mode. Up front lies a 25-megapixel selfie snapper with f/2.0 aperture. Photography hasn’t really been a stronghold of Motorola smartphones. So, it will be interesting to see how the Moto Z4 fares with the cheaper  Pixel 3a  around which definitely has a superior camera setup.  Under the hood, the Moto Z4 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor coupled with 4 GB of RAM. This is the same internal the 3a possesses. The phone runs on a near stock Android v9.0 Pie out of the box. The Z4 offers users 128 GB of internal memory with an option for expansion.  The Moto Z4 has an under-display fingerprint scanner. The device has the P2i splash proof certification, which we recently saw the  Redmi 7A  feature. The Z4 will also support 5G connectivity with an external $200 worth of 5G Moto mod.

['Computex 2019: Dell refreshes their XPS 13 ‘2 in 1’ and XPS 15 and with upgraded internals'],"['Computex 2019', 'Dell', 'Latitude Series']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['May 30, 2019']",2019-05-30 16:49:54+00:00,"['Dell  just refreshed their existing line of premium laptops, i.e the XPS 13 2-in-1 and the XPS 15. Known for their superior build, flagship internals and over the top display, these were already a consumer favorite. So, following the launch of Intel’s new CPUs and Nvidia’s new GPU, a refresh was imminent. The list of improvements includes even more display options, faster internals and some under the hood changes. The only device missing from the announcement was the vanilla XPS 13, that should come out in early 2020.  DELL XPS 15  Officially known as the XPS 15 7590, the laptop brings little to no change in terms of design with the exact same chassis as before. Sure the webcam has moved up to the top which was kind of expected because a similar change was made earlier on the  XPS 13 9380 . And even though the naming suggests otherwise, this one is the direct successor to last year’s XPS 15 9570.  [Note: Dell just wanted the naming scheme for their XPS series to align with the 7000 series from Inspiron, Vostro, Latitude and Precision families. The same goes for it’s XPS 13, so just keep that in mind.]        Also Read:  Dell refreshes its Inspiron lineup with Inspiron 13 5000, 15 7000 & 11 3000 2-in-1 laptops  Back to what’s actually exciting on the new XPS 15, the 9th Gen H-series CPUs from Intel, that includes the eight core i9-9980H. Sure there are other options starting from a Core i5-9300H, the 9980H isn’t something that would go well with that four-year-old chassis. Yes, the CPU is fast, and powerful and can turbo one of its core to 4.8GHz. However, I am little concerned about the thermals because the XPS 15 isn’t known for cooling. Finally, bumping up the graphical capabilities of this laptop is the GTX 1650, an incremental upgrade from GTX 1050Ti of last gen.   The inclusion of an OLED display is also another major change here. The 100,000:1 contrast ratio produces deep blacks and almost makes up for the (decent) 400 nits of max brightness. The same also covers 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut so content creators will not be disappointed by this. The OLED option for the XPS 15 starts at $1800.  The base model will be priced at $999 and comes with an FHD display, i5-9300H CPU, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and no dedicated GPU. The maxed out XPS 15 will come with an i9 processor, GTX 1650, 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD alongside a 4k OLED display. Pricing for the higher end model and the rest of the configurations are yet to go official, and the same goes for their availability as well. What we do know is the cheapest OLED version should cost below $2000, which is pretty appealing.  Also Read:  Asus unveiled some ultra-portable laptops at Computex 2019  XPS 13 2-in-1  The XPS 15 was sort of a disappointment for me, but the XPS 13 2-in-1 brings in a glimmer of hope. This one brings a lot to the table, and it starts with the naming, the new XPS 13 2-in-1 will now carry the 7390 model number.  It is powered by Intel’s new 10th Gen Ice Lake processors, with the inclusion of CPU fans to cool them. There’s also a new MagLev keyboard, a much better display and a few bits of improvements here and there.  However, performance has been immensely improved. The past gen XPS 13 2-in-1 was stuck on a low powered 4.5Watts Y-series CPU, but this one comes with a 15W CPU from Intel’s new 10th Gen series of low powered CPUs based on the Ice Lake architecture. Built on a 10nm process, Intel claims the 10th Gen packs up to 2.5 times more power than the previous generation. The newer SOC also offer better AI processing and gets Wi-Fi 6 support.   With the added power, Dell had to fit in fans to cool the CPU, and they did. Adding a vapor chamber with two fans and GORE cooling while reducing the total footprint of the laptop by 8 percent.\xa0Plus the laptop is now configurable with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD.  Display on this 13.4-inch convertible has moved from a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio to an even more traditional 16:10 ratio. The display size itself has increased by 7% and you can buy one with either an FHD resolution or a 4K panel with HDR support. Either way, brightness maxes out at 500 nits. Eyesafe display technology comes pre-loaded, which is basically just a fancy name for a Bluelight filter. The webcam sits at on top of the display without compromising on the size of the bezels.  The XPS 13 2-in-1 7390 starts at $999 for the base model and will be available in white and black color option.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/XPS-2-in-1-XPS-15.jpg']

Both offer 9th Gen CPUs, a wide variety of GPUs, OLED display options, better design, and improved cooling. Gigabyte is targeting gamers with some impressive internals while the OLED display should lure those creators. Although the design is a bit outdated for my taste, I assume most prefer the boxy, classic, squarish, old fashioned look on these laptops. Both these laptop features Microsoft’s proprietary cloud-based AI feature as well.  Specs (Gigabyte Aero 15 and Aero 17)  Starting off with the specs, you can configure the laptop with either an i7-9750H or an i9-9980HK. As for the GPU, the Aero 15 without the OLED display is only available with an RTX 2070 Max Q. The OLED version is available with all mobile GPUs from the 16-series and 20-series family from Nvidia.  The Aero 17 offers similar configurations, but without the base GTX 1650. RAM and storage max out at 64GB and 2TB (SSD) respectively.

Although the laptop maker released a  wide variety of ultrabooks , the company did not quite stop there. Asus already had a number of commendable gaming laptops. And this time around, the Taiwanese company refreshed its gaming lineup with some top-tier performers. In that run, Asus showcased ROG Strix Scar III, ROG Strix Hero III, and Zephyrus S GX502 in the event.  Asus ROG Strix Scar III  Being the gaming-class laptop, the device boasts some top-tier features. The Asus Strix Scar III comes with two different sizes of displays. One of them comes with a 17.3-inch display, which refreshes at 144Hz. The smaller one with a 15.6-inch screen, on the other hand, has a refresh rate of 240Hz.         Talking about the performance, Asus Strix Scar III comes with the latest 9 th  gen Intel Core i7-9750H processor and RTX 2070 graphics card.

Scar III enjoys 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD for storage. You can also make use of the extra SATA slot when additional memory space is required.  Asus ROG Strix Hero III  Just like on the last year’s Strix Scar II and  Hero II , there are also a fair amount of similarities between Hero III and Scar III. The processor here is the same Intel Core i7-9750H. Even the RAM and storage remained indifferent here. But we can see a hint of a downgrade on the graphics front. The Hero III comes aboard with RTX 2060 GPU, which is inferior than what we saw on the Scar III.   Another major difference would be on the display front. You can just get a single variant on the display side of things. The screen used here is sized 15.6-inch, which refreshes at 144Hz.  Asus Zephyrus S GX502  The Zephyrus S GX502 packs a 15.6-inch display, which enjoys Ultra-HD resolution. The interesting thing here is that the panel refreshes at 120Hz, which is really commendable for a laptop with a 4K display. With such a high refresh rate, the laptop offers a very smooth experience for the gamers. The screen on this device also supports 100% Adobe RGB Color gamut along with Pantone certification.   The laptop comes with Magnesium-alloy chassis, which encloses 9 th  gen Intel Core processor. To handle the games and graphics-intensive tasks, Asus has incorporated RTX 2070.

That was something else of a laptop by Alienware back in 2018. But guess what? We already have another m15 from Alienware. The new Alienware m15 R2 is a completely new laptop. It’s flatter, thinner, looks more mature, and has a lot of tweaks. If you liked and wanted to get the previous version, this one is a no brainer (unless you actually bought the last one). Here’s what this one brings.  Dell Alienware m15 R2 Overview  Design  The design on this laptop is a bit “complicated”. I can’t exactly say what makes it so. It still weighs the same at  2.16 Kgs  and is still as thick as the previous model. The R2 leaves the angular design of the 1st gen and takes a more  Area 51m -ish approach. It features a  magnesium alloy chassis  and comes in two new colors:  Lunar Light  and the  Dark side of the Moon . Even with the same thickness, more or less, it now gets a larger  76 Whr battery .  Performance  As for performance, the Alienware m15 R2 comes refreshed with the  9th Gen Intel CPUs. \xa0 The base config starts with an  i5-9300H  and goes all the way up to an  i9-9980HK   @ 5 GHz . The same goes for the GPU, starting with a  GTX 1650  and moving all the way up to an  RTX 2080 Max Q . That’s a lot of options to choose from and we haven’t even gotten to the display of the storage options yet.         Memory config starts at single channel 8 GB @ 2666 MHz but the only other config is the 16 GB dual-channel model at the same speeds. For storage, there are no mechanical hard drives to start with. You get  two M.2 SSD slots , with configuration options starting all the way from  256 GB  to a staggering  4TB (2x2TB) on RAID 0 . In addition, Intel Optane storage is also available as an option.  Also Read:  Best Gaming laptops to buy in Nepal  Display  The  15.6-inch display  on the Alienware m15 R2 starts with a  Full-HD resolution and 60Hz refresh rate . You can also bump the refresh rate to 240 Hz, with a response time of 7ms. It’s only when you increase the screen resolution to  4K@60Hz  (which is the top end model with an OLED panel) that you can carry a perfect response time of 1ms. The latter two options will come with optional  Tobii Eyetracking technology .   Alienware will also let you plug in more powerful monitors through its ThunderBolt 3 port, so you are pretty much all set in this department. As for heat management, Alienware’s new  Cryo Tech Cooling 3.0  takes care of that. Furthermore, there is a new keyboard (with RGB) that ups the travel distance to 1.7mm. The laptop will starts shipping June 11 while  pricing starts at $1,500  alongside the  Alienware m17 R2 .  What do you think of this new Alienware m15 R2?

['Huawei Y5 2019 and Y7 Pro 2019 – Price in Nepal and Competition'],['Huawei'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 29, 2019']",2019-05-29 10:31:52+00:00,"['With every new budget releases, Huawei tries to conquer the market segment that is dominated by likes of Xioami and Samung. It was the aim when Huawei released the Huawei Y5 2019 and Huawei Y7 pro back in 2019. Let’s check out if Huawei Y5 2019 and Huawei Y7 Pro 2019 are still worth their price in Nepal today.  Huawei Y5 2019  Design and Display  The  Y5 2019  is a budget-oriented offering from the company. Nonetheless, this budget phone is wrapped with premium-looking  faux leather material on the back . Apart from looking fancy, the faux leather back also happens to be  anti-dirty, anti-fingerprint, and wear-resistant . So kudos to Huawei for incorporating such a design in a budget device.         Talking about the display, the phone has included a  5.71-inch IPS panel . Huawei has also incorporated a tiny notch atop the display. The resolution here is  HD+  and it is to be expected from a budget phone. The Y5 2019 also comes with the  TUV Rheinland certification  on its display. This certification ensures that the display on this handset keeps harmful blue light under control.  Camera  On to the imaging department, the phone encompasses a  13MP shooter on the rear panel  and a  5MP selfie shooter on the front . The front shooter on this device also doubles as a biometric means to unlock the phone. The selfie snapper comes into action while unlocking the phone via  Face Unlock feature . And it is said to recognize 1024 facial features. Huawei also claims it to be reliable. With the absence of the fingerprint scanner, this is the only biometric means to unlock the device. So it might come in quite handy.   Performance and Memory  The performance part is handled by  MediaTek Helio A22 chipset . The phone also comes with  2GB RAM  and  16GB of onboard memory  to complement the processor. It’s the generosity of Huawei that the company has also included a  dedicated SD Card slot  for memory expansion. Y5 2019 packs a  3020mAh battery  to keep the device running.  Although the Y5 2019 has strengthened Huawei’s budget lineup, there are still better contenders at a similar price. The  Samsung Galaxy A10  (Rs. 14, 190) and  Xiaomi Redmi 7  (Rs. 14,999) are better performers than the Y5 2019 in almost every aspect. Just at a price difference of Rs. 300, you can find some amazing devices like the  Samsung Galaxy M10  (Rs. 13,790). So I am not hopeful that this device could make a mark in the  budget segment .

Huawei had already released the  Y7 Pro 2019  in Nepal back in Nepal. But this time, the new Y7 Pro 2019 comes with a bumped up storage and a fingerprint scanner.  When Huawei launched the Y7 Pro, there were already a handful of amazing phones. And in an already fierce competition, the phone received quite a backlash mainly due to the absence of the fingerprint scanner. But amending those mistakes, Huawei brought a brand new device including a fingerprint sensor on the back.   Apart from the fingerprint, this new device also comes with  64GB storage , which is a significant upgrade over the previous model, which had 32GB of onboard memory. The rest of the features remains the same here. It gets a  6.26-inch HD display  with a tiny notch on the top.  Snapdragon 450 chipset  takes care of the performance here, which comes alongside the  3GB RAM .  The rear camera on this device is a combination of  13MP  and  2MP sensors . With the dual camera on the board, you can expect some portrait images from here. Flipping to the front, we can see a  16MP selfie snapper  dwelling on the notch.  The battery is the major highlight of this device. It comes with a humongous  4000mAh battery . Given the low-res display and power-efficient SD450 chipset, we can expect a dependable endurance.

['RedmiBook 14 Announced – The first affordable ultrabook from Xiaomi'],"['Opinion', 'Redmi', 'Ultrabook']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 29, 2019']",2019-05-29 09:00:29+00:00,"['So…along with the launch of the new self-proclaimed flagship killer,  Redmi K20 Pro , the company also announced an ultrabook – the RedmiBook 14. The Redmi sub-brand is all about great specs for an even better price. And they tried to do the same with the  RedmiBook 14 . This laptop features some great specs, so let’s learn more about the Redmibook 14 price and expected availability including Nepal.  RedmiBook 14 Overview  The RedmiBook 14 has about the same looks like the  Mi Notebook  at a glance. However, there are some slight differences. Still, the Mi Notebook looked like the  Apple MacBook Pro , and this one follows the same footsteps.  It’s a 14-inch laptop…the name clearly gives it away. The screen is a  14-inch IPS panel with Full-HD resolution . And that’s the standard for ultra-books today, as well as for other laptops as well. The bezels on it are pretty thin, giving it a good 81.2% screen to body ratio. And so, this one still packs the webcam on its rightful place – at the top.         The body is all-metal –  anodized aluminum , with a clean silver color finish. And this makes it resemble the MacBook even more! At  1.5 kg weight , this is not the lightest ultrabook, of course, but it is the standard. Also, it’s 1.8 cm thin, which is, again, the standard choice for most ultrabooks. So, we’re not seeing anything new here, are we?  As for the performance and specs, you can choose from an i5 or an i7. Both are, however, the  8th-gen WhiskeyLake processors . Of course, being ultrabooks, they feature Ultra-low-power U-series CPUs, but they can hold their own against most tasks. Also, there’s the  NVidia MX250 graphics  for your light gaming and editing needs, too.  RAM, starts at  4 GB  and you can have up to 8 GB of it. As for the storage, you get up to a  512 GB SSD . Port selection, though, doesn’t look very good. You get  three USB-As, an HDMI, an audio jack , and that’s about it!mAgain, by the looks of it…just another average ultrabook in the market. The only thing great about it is its price.  Specifications in a nutshell:   Design and Build : All metal body, Anodized aluminum, 1.79 cm thickness, 1.5 kg  Display : 14-inch IPS LCD Full HD panel (1920 x 1080), 250 nits max brightness, Anti-Glare  CPU : 8th-gen Intel i5-8365U / Intel i7-8565U WhiskeyLake  GPU : Nvidia MX250 2 GB GDDR5  RAM : 4 GB / 8 GB  Storage : 256 GB SSD / 512 GB SSD (SATA)  Battery : 46 Watt-hour  Price : CNY 3999 ($580) – CNY 4999 ($720)   Redmibook 14 Impressions:  As you can plainly see, the RedmiBook 14 doesn’t have anything new to offer. We get the same kind of U-series processors, a standard IPS display, SSD, very familiar design, and not much else. Its only selling point would have to be the price.   But then again, with so many big players in the laptop segment, will this new player be able to sustain itself? Because see…laptops are very different from phones. Redmi has been doing a good job with its phones, but a laptop is something else. There’s a lot of stuff that goes into it, and I don’t see anyone else buying this laptop other than Redmi fans.  First off, with so many other big players, this laptop might not get a good place out there. Sure, it has an attractive price, but since you don’t swap out a laptop every year like phones, people will be willing to pay a bit extra for a more premium product. Then, there’s accessibility. Considering it makes its way out of China, getting spare parts and genuine replacement will be pretty difficult. The same happened to Razer in their starting days, but back then, there were comparatively fewer competitors? Now…it’s a jungle! Will they be able to pull it off? I, for one, don’t think so.  To me, it seems like Redmi hasn’t thought all the way through. If they have, well, that’s good, but it might follow the same footsteps of the Mi Notebook series. Sure, they launched with a hub-hub, but do you even see them around these days? My point exactly. I’m very skeptical about the RedmiBook 14. Let us know your thoughts.  Xiaomi Redmibook 14 Price and Availability  The base model of the Redmibook 14 with an 8th gen i5 processor, 4 GB RAM, and 256 GB SSD costs  CNY 3999 ($580),  and the highest config can go up to  CNY 4999 ($720) . Now, that’s certainly pocket-friendly! There is no news of its official availability in Nepal, but you can find the Redmibook 14 in Nepal for a price of Rs. 75,000 (base variant).']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/redmibook-14-announced.jpg']

And after a lot of speculations, the company has finally launched the Redmi K20 and the Redmi K20 Pro which are among the cheapest top-quality smartphones available right now.  Redmi K20 Pro Overview  The Redmi K20 Pro is the expensive of the two smartphones that were launched today. This device packs flagship grade specifications all while featuring an inexpensive price tag. The Redmi K20 Pro sports a 6.39-inch full HD+ display that has an AMOLED panel. This display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and is completely bezel-less.  Like all flagships of 2019, the Redmi K20 Pro is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset coupled with Adreno 640. The device is available in two RAM versions – 6 GB and 8 GB. The 6 GB version comes with 64 GB and 128 GB variants while the 8 GB model features 128 GB and 256 GB storage versions.         The Redmi K20 Pro runs on Android 9.0 Pie with MIUI 10 out of the box. It has a 4,000 mAh battery with 27W Quick Charge 4+ which promises to provide 58% of charge in 30 minutes.  Just like the  OnePlus 7 Pro , the Redmi K20 Pro is equipped with triple camera setup on the rear. There is a 48-megapixel primary lens, a 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens. This camera will record slow-mo videos at 960fps. For selfies, Xiaomi has included a 20-megapixel motorized pop-up camera.

And that’s the reason why Xiaomi has excluded a couple of features the flagship device comes with. Even then, for the price, the K20 definitely looks quality!  The Redmi K20 has the same display with the bezel-less design and the pop-up camera. One of the major differences lies inside the device as the K20 comes with the 8nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 chipset. This phone has 6 GB of RAM and features 64 GB or 128 GB of internal memory, according to the users choice.   The K20 features three cameras on the back, but instead of the Sony IMX586 sensor on the primary 48-megapixel camera, which the K20 Pro dons, this device has the Sony IMX582 sensor. The other two lenses are the same, though.  The other difference the K20 has is the fast charging capability. Its 4000 mAh battery is supported by an 18W fast charging technology.

['ARM announces Cortex-A77 CPU and Mali-G77 GPU promising a significant boost in performance'],['ARM'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 28, 2019']",2019-05-28 12:40:37+00:00,"['Around last week, ARM came into limelight when it said it would pull back  its support for Huawei . And this time, ARM made the headline again. This time, the British company made a headline because of its newly announced CPU and GPU architecture. At its annual TechDay event, the chipmaker unveiled new ARM Cortex-A77 CPU core architecture and a new Mali-G77 GPU architecture.  ARM Cortex-A77 CPU  The Cortex-A77 is the successor of the Cortex-A76 CPU cores, which was launched last year. The Cortex-A76 CPU architecture was used on popular chips like  HiSilicon Kirin 980  and  Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 . The CPU promised a 20 to up to 35% boost in performance back then. And implementing the design, Qualcomm gained 45% upsurge in performance on SD855 when compared with SD845.         This new chip is based on that same efficient Cortex-A76 GPU template.\xa0The company says that the Cortex-A77 is the second generation of the design we saw on the Cortex-A76. And it will be still be based on 7nm architecture. But still, there will be a 20% improvement in performance over the last year’s model. ARM achieved this significant upgrade in performance by increasing IPC (Instructions per Clock/Cycle). This means that the new core can work with more set of instructions at a time. And to achieve this, ARM adopted wider core and made improvements to keep the CPU core fed with things to do.  20% IPC gain is a huge feat here because even while sticking to the same thermal and power constraints as before, the performance increases nonetheless. This is even more commendable in the case of ARM because AMD has just managed to achieve 15% IPS boost between Zen2 and Zen+. And in the case of Intel, it has remained virtually static over the last few years.   Continuing with the performance, A77 promises to deliver a 23% increase in integer and a 35% increase in floating point performance in the SPEC2006. ARM has also improved the memory latency by 15% and the company believes that the clock speed on the A77 will max out at 3.0GHz, just like on the A76.  To decrease the bottleneck in the back-end and to increase the core’s performance, ARM has also included a new ALU in the A77’s back-end. The A77 also gets dedicated issue ports on its L1/L2 Data Caches for store-data pipelines and improved engines to ensure improved power efficiency. Alongside the power efficiency, this results in an improvement in data prefetching.  Mali-G77 GPU  On to the GPU part, ARM has implemented a new architecture called Vallhall. And implementing this new architecture, ARM claims to achieve a 40% boost on the GPU performance. With this new microarchitecture, energy efficiency also increases by 30%. The Mali-G77 GPU also offers 30% better performance density allowing the chipmakers to accommodate more power into less space.  Addressing the growing use of the AI-related features in recent days, ARM has also increased the machine-learning performance by 60%. The company believes that it will significantly boost inference and neural net (NN) performance for advanced on-device intelligence.   With this new CPU and GPU, the company hopes to facilitate the adoption of 5G, Internet of Things, AI, and autonomous driving tech. And the new Cortex-A77 CPU and Mali-G77 GPU look and sounds amazing. However, the chip-making companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Huawei can implement this design only the Q3/Q4 of 2019. So we may only be able to see smartphones/tablets with Cortex-A77 based chips in late 2019 and on 2020.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Arm-Cortex-A77-cpu-mali-g77-gpu.jpg']

And that success story might have inspired ByteDance. ByteDance is a China-based company, which made the popular TikTok app. This is one of the most successful startups in recent times. The app has already received over 500 million downloads in Play Store. After the massive success with the TikTok app, the company is reportedly shifting its focus towards the smartphone territory. The two sources quoted by the Financial Times have highlighted the new smartphone from ByteDance would come preloaded apps from the company itself. That includes news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, an  unreleased music streaming service , and the obviously the fan favorite TikTok.  According to the Financial Times, the CEO of ByteDance Zhang Yiming has long dreamt of building a smartphone full of preloaded apps. So the company seems to be aggressively working on its own set of apps first. And we have heard quite a lot of the music streaming service. This music platform is said to go head to head against the likes of Spotify and Apple Music. The music-streaming app is said to make its debut first in the emerging markets like India. ByteDance has even sealed the deal with T-Series and Times Music, which are the major music labels in India.  The Chinese startup also launched a new chat app this month. Dubbed as Feiliao or Flipchat, the app lets the users communicate with instant messages and chat groups that match their interests.        We also saw the company launching a new app named Duoshan back in January. This video chatting app shares most of its features with Snapchat.  With already a handful of apps on their arsenal, the company is now striding forward to bring a new smartphone. ByteDance has already reached an agreement with Beijing-based Company Smartisan. With the deal, ByteDance also acquired a patent portfolio and some of the Smartisan employees for their new endeavor.  These reports claim that the smartphone seems to be on the works.

The announcement includes the flagship Ryzen 9 3900X that offers 12 cores for just $499. The bottom of the list (as far as the announcement is concerned) was the Ryzen 5 3600, which offers six cores for just $199. And while these sound great as it is, the Zen 2 cores and the x570 chipset will add a lot more reasons to opt for AMD, now more than ever.  Zen 2   All 3000 series Ryzen processors are based on AMD’s new Zen 2 microarchitecture. The company claims that its new Zen 2 Cores will deliver 15% more IPC as compared to its predecessor. Another improvement includes doubling the floating point engine while offering twice the cache size as compared to its previous version. In simpler words, this new architecture will significantly boost the performance of their new Ryzen and EPYC processors.        3000 series Ryzen Processors   A total of five CPUs were announced at the event today. With the cheapest of the bunch sporting six cores climbing all the way up to 12 cores, a first for any gaming CPU in the market yet. All five of them offer 40 PCIe lanes. That includes the CPU’s 24 PCIe 4.0 lanes plus the x570 chipset’s 16 lanes. Among the CPU’s 24 lanes, 16 are for the GPU, 4 for storage and 4 for the chipset. All of the following CPUs will start shipping from July 7.     Model  Cores/ Threads  TDP (Watts)  Boost/Base (GHz)  Total Cache (MB)  PCIe 4.0 Lanes*  MSRP    Ryzen 9 3900X  12/24  105W  4.6/3.8  70  40  $499    Ryzen 7 3800X  8/16  105W  4.5/3.9  36  40  $399    Ryzen 7 3700X  8/16  65W  4.4/3.6  36  40  $329    Ryzen 5 3600X  6/12  95W  4.4/3.8  35  40  $249    Ryzen 5 3600  6/12  65W  4.2/3.6  35  40  $199     AMD vs Intel  Comparing the newest and greatest from AMD with what Intel has to offer. And for the first round, we compare the Ryzen 3700X and it’s 8 cores 16 threads with the i7 9700k and it’s 8 cores no hyperthreading. The Ryzen 3700X unsurprisingly beats the 9700k in real time rendering test by a humble 1% in single-threaded performance and a whopping 30% in the multi-threaded test. Then there was the Ryzen 3800X, matching the game play performance of the 9900k over PUBG.   Finally, the $500 Ryzen 3900X crushed the 12 core  i9-9920X  in Blender Render by 16%. These are of course numbers shared by AMD themselves so maybe wait until a few of the known reviewers get their hands on these processors. But then again, this does clearly show the end of Intel’s dominance, not only under multi-core intensive tasks but now over single-threaded workloads as well. The red team has always enjoyed superior pricing.  Also Read:  MSI Laptop price in Nepal  X570  The story doesn’t end here. Even though the new set of CPUs still mounts to the same AM4 socket, there is a new chipset in town. The new X570 is the world’s first PCIe 4.0 chipset with over 50 new motherboard models from ASRock, MSI, and Gigabyte. With so many motherboards soon entering the market, there is surely a lot of trust building over the 3000-series Ryzen processors. Going by what we know, they should surely sell well, plus AMD is pushing new buyers to opt for the newer X570 chipsets as well (for obvious reasons).

The uprising Chinese smartphone maker also makes other electronics devices on time and often. They have a whole variety of electronics devices in their lineup. From headphones/earphones and power banks to air purifiers and electric bicycles, they show quite a versatility while producing the gadgets. And this time around, the company released yet another portable power bank to expand its electronics’ lineup. But this is not an ordinary power bank. This new power bank from the company also comes with a makeup mirror and 12-high brightness LED lights attached to it.  Although the product received limelight with the name of Xiaomi, it’s not directly manufactured by Xiaomi. The product came from one of the companies on Xiaomi’s ecological chains. But it’s the product that really matters right?  Being a portable power bank, this 2-in-1 device comes with a small factor yet packing an electrical juice on the inside. This power bank comes with a 3000mAh capacity, which accepts powers and charges the devices at 5V/1A. Since the capacity is not really overwhelming, it can be understood that it is targeted just for emergency use. But apart from the power, the device comes with a makeup mirror included inside. And this feature has made this power bank somewhat quirkier in its category. The company has especially targetted this product for women customers. And since this device comes at a size of 85 x 76 x 17mm and weighs merely 145 grams, it easily fits on the ladies’ purses.         To increase the functionality of the device, Xiaomi has also used 2x magnifying glass design. So the objects look closer and clearer without any distortions. And the users can see even the tiny details on the face while putting on the makeup.  apart from that, this makeup houses with 12 high-brightness LED lamp beads. The company claims that these beads can emit a color temperature and light that stimulates the natural light. Also, this 2-in-1 device promises to project a uniform and natural light beam. With these features, the company points out that it could even be usable in environments with low light settings.   And talking about the lights, they can be turned on by pressing a button for a short time. Once the button is pressed, the fill light gradually glows on and completes its glowing process in 1 second. The brightness of the LEDs increases from low value to its maximum value within 3 seconds. Similar is the case while turning off the lights. Once the button is pressed, it takes a second to turn off the lights completely. But you can also close the mirror if you want the lights to go off automatically.  The device comes in Marine Water, Coral, and Green color variants and is priced at 129 Yuan ($18 or Rs. 2000). It is currently available for purchase in China through AliExpress.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/xiaomi-makeup-mirror-power-bank.jpg']

Because, just after a month of that release, they launched the  Redmi Y3 , which is almost identical to the Redmi 7, except for a high-res  32 MP selfie camera . And apart from that, everything else is the same. So, does this 32 MP selfie camera phone help them any? Find out in this review.

By default, the Redmi Y3 uses  pixel binning  to take 8 MP photos from its 32 MP lens. But it also lets you shoot pictures in 32 MP resolution. Of course, higher resolution doesn’t mean better images. And so, at first glance, it’s really, really hard to tell the difference between them.      Redmi Y3 8 MP vs 32 MP selfies   1  of 8               8 MP         32 MP         8 MP         32 MP         8 MP         32 MP         Low light 8 MP         Low Light 32 MP                                    The only visible difference is when you try to zoom in the images, which is natural. When zoomed in, the 32 MP shots preserve details on the subject, while the 8 MP cannot. But the  background looks slightly sharper on the 8 MP images , which is, thanks to pixel binning. But that’s about it. And since we don’t really zoom the pictures after, you can say there are, virtually, no differences between them.      Redmi Y3 HDR selfie samples   1  of 4               8 MP HDR         32 MP HDR         8 MP HDR         32 MP HDR                        But sometimes, when the HDR is turned on, in both modes, the 32 MP cannot capture the shadow details, highlights, and low lights properly, while the 8 MP does. And again, when the lighting conditions are great, the 8 MP shots make for a better background. In other scenarios, they’re pretty much the same…even in low light shots like these.      Redmi Y3 portrait selfie   1  of 3                             Group portrait selfie                     One thing, however, is that  you cannot take portrait selfies with the 32 MP camera . \xa0Having said that, the 8MP default mode does a good job of edge detection and blurs, so, they can take good portrait selfies.      Redmi Y3 Beauty Mode 4.0   1  of 6               Beauty Mode Off         Beauty Mode Medium         Beauty Mode Max         Off         Medium         Max                              And yes, the Beauty Mode, here, dubbed the  Beauty Mode 4.0  is something they talked extensively about in the launch. But, to be honest, this beauty mode looks just like any other to me. What the beauty mode does is smoothens the skin tone, and removes dark areas and other unpleasantries. So, not really something to hype about, is it?  Now I didn’t really get a chance to compare the selfie camera with that of the Redmi 7. However, since this phone’s 4 GB variant and the base 3GB model of the  Redmi Note 7  costs about the same, I thought, why not? But to be fair, the Redmi Note 7 packs a lot better specs than this one. So, I only tested the selfie camera of these two, just to see if the 32 MP camera really is better.  And the results were, more or less, as expected. The 32 MP camera does a better job than Note 7’s 13 MP camera. See for yourself. When compared side by side, the Note 7’s selfies are washed out. The colors have this cold tone to them, and there is not enough dynamic range.      Redmi Y3 vs Redmi Note 7 Selfie   1  of 6               Redmi Note 7         Redmi Y3         Note 7         Y3         Note 7         Y3                              The Y3, on the other hand, takes more vibrant pictures and looks true to life. Portrait images, too, look better on the Y3, from colors on the subject to the background, and down to edge detection. When you zoom in, the details are slightly better on the Note 7. But the Y3’s selfies are better to look at, so, that’s that.   As for the rear cameras, they’re again very similar to the Redmi Y7’s camera configuration. It packs a dual camera setup comprising of a 12 MP primary camera and a 2 MP depth sensor. Classic budget phone!

Pretty good for a budget device, that is. Saturation is on point, while there’s a bit of a cool tone in the images. Details in the photos are also, only okay. They look good at first glance, but zooming reveals, that it cannot preserve the details all that well.  For hi-res images of the camera samples,  click here>>  Performance  Since the selfie camera is the only notable difference on this phone compared to the Redmi 7, I didn’t really do an extensive test on other aspects. I did play around with it a little, but it more or less yielded the same results.  From the internal hardware to the displays, and everything…down to the benchmark scores, it’s the same phone. And that should be obvious, because, this phone runs on the same chipset –  Snapdragon 632 .   Geekbench 4   Single-Core: 1226  Multi-Core: 4322    AnTuTu 7   103970    AndroBench   Sequential Read: 291.04 MB/s  Sequential Write: 122.82 MB/s     So, nothing new to be expected either. Games like PUBG and Asphalt 9 run on medium settings, smoothly, and multi-tasking runs without a hitch, too. It even has the same issues as the Redmi 7, taking a while to load some apps.  Design      Redmi Y3 Design   1  of 4               Back         Buttons         Ports and Grills         IR Blaster / Headphone jack                        Another small difference is the colors this phone is available in…I don’t know if it matters all that well, but I’m just putting it out there for the record. The design is identical to the Redmi 7 – same kind of curved body with plastic construction. A bit big to fit snugly in your hands, but nothing so uncomfortable.  Display   The display, too, is the same at  6.26” with HD resolution . At this size, again, HD display is not what I would want, but I cannot demand more for the price, either. But what it gives you for this price, is  Gorilla Glass 5 protection  on the display, which, I cannot even say the same for some other mid-range phones, let alone budget ones!  Battery  Battery life is pretty good, similar to the Redmi 7. The  4000 mAh battery  lasts like a day and a half, easily. The problem, here, is the  10 Watt Charging . So, do yourselves a favor and get a faster charger.  Conclusion  Overall, the Redmi Y3 is a good phone, just kinda unnecessary. Maybe they should’ve included the better front camera on the Redmi 7 itself. It just seems like there are too many choices, and Redmi 7 is competing with its brother in the market! But hey, that’s my view. Everything else depends on your preference.   The Y3 is available in 2 variants: 3/32 GB and 4/64 GB. And the Y3 is slightly more expensive than the Redmi 7, a difference of about Rs.1500. That extra premium is what you pay for the selfie camera, I guess. However, as I already said, the 4 GB model costs as much as Redmi Note 7’s base model.  See Redmi Note 7 price  here .  So, if you’re thinking of getting the 4 GB version of the Redmi Y3, you should get the Redmi Note 7 instead. It’s a lot better than this one, except for the selfie camera.  So, would you go for the Redmi 7, or the Redmi Y3… or the Redmi Note 7? Do let us know.  Pros:    Good performance  Good battery life  Value for money  Better selfie camera   Cons:   Average Rear Camera  Ads-laden software  HD display']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Redmi-Y3-Review.jpg']

Samsung Galaxy Xcover 5, the successor to the Xcover 4 launched in March 2017 recently received FCC certification. This hints that the smartphone would be launching anytime soon. The listing also revealed some of the major specs of the device.  The new Galaxy device appeared in FCC bearing the model number SM-G398FN/DS which is expected to be the Xcover 5. While going through the certification process, the listing also revealed that the phone would carry a 10.78Wh battery at 3.85 volts. These ratings imply that the battery on the device would of 2800mAh capacity. That’s the same value as the previous model.  FCC did not reveal further details about the phone. However, some hardware details came from Geekbench, which cues it to be a budget phone. The information from Geekbench points out to an Exynos 7885 chipset with 3GB RAM on the performance front. The phone would boot on Android Pie out of the box. And like most of the Samsung phones out there, this one too will ship with One UI atop the Android Pie.        Although most of the rumors about this new Galaxy phone converges to the Xcover 5, a Dutch retailer Centralpoint listed the SM-G398 on their website with the moniker Xcover 4S.

Well, sometimes…they’re kinda fun, too. But deep-faked videos and pictures around is rampant on the internet. And at such a time, Samsung revealed their own Deep Fake AI. And what’s mind-boggling is that Samsung’s Deep Fake AI that can  fabricate videos using a single image ! Also, the demonstration showed how Mona Lisa would have looked if she could do more than smile like that!   This is a result of the researchers at  Samsung’s AI center in Moscow . Their video demonstration and paper, on the journal,  ArXiv  showed the capabilities of machine learning, called “ One-Shot ” and “ Few-Shot “. The result of this is it can bring faces to life from one still picture. Its usage? Well, I can’t think of very useful features of this…but there are some sinister applications of this. However, those sinister application is something many of us might have already seen.         How does it work?  Samsung’s Deep Fake AI algorithm is trained using the publicly available VoxCeleb database. It contains more than 7,000 images of celebrities from YouTube videos. Using that, the AI established some universally identifiable traits in faces – subjects’ nose, eyes and more. These landmark features, once identified can be used in other still images as well.  Source:  Egor Zakharov  The algorithm recognizes common characteristics in the face of the subject. So, it’s able to deduce images with little input. And sometimes, it can create videos of those who were never captured on video. And the more images are fed into the program, the more realistic the resulting video is. Therefore, a single image converted into a moving face might look highly altered, but a sample of about 16 to 32 images can produce lifelike results.  And since it can also use selfies to do that, it is also applicable for the general public and not just celebrities and famous dead personalities. However, the AI, at its current state is only able to  produce “talking head” style videos of subjects from the shoulder up . But of course, this can quickly change. It’s AI after all…  Recently, former employees of Google and Microsoft also showed how an algorithm convincingly duplicated the voice of a popular podcaster, Joe Regan. If we combine these two technologies, well, imagine what can be done… From using it to create fake videos and spreading misinformation, you can also steal someone else’s identity!  It doesn’t always have to be this serious. If you’ve seen the movie Justice League, then Superman’s face uses the same kind of deep fake algorithm to hide Henry Cavil’s mustache! But then again, its usage is mostly in weird fetishes.  But some of you might be familiar with what I’m talking about. Such deep fakes technology is already in use to create porn videos of celebrities… There are many users who use similar sophisticated AI technology and use photographs to create human masks and overlaid on porn-actors. Seen some things like that? Weird, right?  So, yeah…while AI is progressing further, it seems we’ll keep finding sinister ways to use it our various twisted ways.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/samsung-deep-fake-ai-1.jpg']

Not just that, the company will be launching the new  Zen 2 CPUs , several motherboards, and of course a few other Navi based GPUs. And while we are on the subject of GPUs, those include the RX3070 and RX3060 alongside the RX3080. Based on a 7nm process, the GPUs are here to give Nvidia some stiff competition in the mid-range segment, both in terms of performance and pricing.  Why Nvidia isn’t happy!!   No company is happy about their competitor’s product launch, but the plot thickens. Based on the Navi architecture, the RX3080 goes head to head with the Turing based Nvidia’s RTX 2080. You can see how this might be a problem for Nvidia. Buyers could opt for something called the “3080” over “2080” assuming the latter is an inferior product. Plus, Nvidia might release the RTX 30-series sometime soon. Maybe that’s why Nvidia filed a trademark for the numbers “3080”, “4080” and “5080” with the EU Intellectual Property Office.        Also Read:  MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8SF – Is RTX 2070 an overkill?  AMD Navi RX3080  Based on the new Navi architecture, the GPU is rumored to offer eight shader engines, 2,560 stream processes with 8GB of VRAM. A quick look at the diagram below shows eight shader engines with five compute engines each for a total of 40 CUs. While the naming does suggest it’s a direct RTX 2080 competitor, it will more be looking to compete with the  RTX 2070  and the GTX 1080. As for pricing, some sources claim around $500.   The new Navi 10 architecture will be able to scale more than 4 shader engines for every die of microarchitecture. This is, of course, just leaks at this point, but if it turns out to be true, AMD engineers have finally overcome their previous limitations.

In addition, what if I told you it’s full of viruses… And not just your regular everyday viruses, but the  most dangerous ones throughout history  that have caused over $95 billion damage?  Strange, right? Well, this laptop is apparently a work of art. Dubbed as “ The Persistence of Chaos “, this laptop contains the six deadliest computer viruses known to mankind. The artist behind this work of “genius” is a  Chinese artist, Guo O Dong . And he collaborated with  Deep Instinct , a cyber security firm. The firm ensured all safety protocols necessary to prevent the virus from spreading, and so, the viruses reside in their forever home, right now. Artists do strange things, and Dong explained that he created this piece to see how the world responds to and values the impact of malware. Right now, this one is up for auction, and the  current bid resides at slightly over $1.2 million !         Of course, the ones who’re bidding must really be crazy, or hate themselves. But it’s their money. We’re not judging. However, the laptop is air-gapped to prevent it from spreading, and Deep Instinct believes it is impossible to breach. Also, they plan to disable all the ports after the auction ends…so that the viruses have no way of escaping!  Six Deadly Sins  What are these deadliest viruses in this The Persistence of Chaos, you may ask? Here they are in all their glory:  ILOVEYOU\xa0 is the first malware, which first showed up in 2000 and spread to the masses via email. It came in the form of a love letter attachment, that when clicked on, sent similar messages to your contact list. Also, opening it meant it would overwrite random files on your computer. It affected over 500000 systems and did about  $15 billion worth damage .  SoBig\xa0 showed up in 2003, as a worm and a Trojan virus that circulated via email spam. This malware could copy files, email itself to others and damage your computer software / hardware components. It remains the second fastest spreading virus till date, doing about  $37 billion in damages  to hundreds of thousands of computers  MyDoom  appeared in 2004, and became the fastest spreading malware. It sent junk emails through infected computers, with the text  “andy, I’m just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry” . And by conducting some DDoS attacks, it did a  damage of $38 billion !  BlackEnergy  was discovered in 2007 and remained in operation for the longest amount of time until 2015. It caused a massive cyber attack that caused a  large-scale blackout in Ukraine in December 2015 . Some say it was one of the most sophisticated malware.  DarkTequilla  appeared in 2013, and with its sophisticated and evasive nature, targeted users in Latin America. It stole personal and corporate data including bank credentials, even when offline. It spread through spear phishing and infected USB Flash drives, and did  hundreds of millions of damage .  WannaCry   is probably the most well known, as it took place in 2017, as a global attack. It infected over 200000 computers from around 150 countries, causing the National Health Service in the US of $100 million damage and  over $4 billion damage to the public . The attackers demanded ransom in BitCoin!  The Persistence of Chaos brought the deadliest computer viruses ever together in a single computer. What could go wrong, right?

That could be one of the reasons why Apple is quite suffering the iPhone sales drop recently. Another reason would be the innovative products from Samsung and Huawei. So to cope with the challenges, Apple could bring some major upgrades over the last year iPhones. And the new rumors and leaks certainly have made us more hopeful about it.  Also Read:  iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max Announced: When is Nepal Launch date inc. Price?  Major Upgrades on the iPhone 11  Multiple camera setup is a growing trend in the smartphone market. Huawei started triple camera setup with its flagship  P20 Pro  smartphone last year. And since then smartphone camera has not been the same again. Huawei and Samsung are leading the DxOmark leaderboards when it comes to their camera prowess and iPhones are left far behind. But Apple is expected to make a comeback in the race.  It’s been a fair amount of time we have been hearing about triple rear cameras on the upcoming iPhone. But we told you to take it as a pinch of salt back then. Now new leaks of the phone have surfaced online with lively shapes. The leaked image shows the iPhones with three cameras at the back arranged in a triangular configuration.         Source: EverythingApplePro  Last year’s iPhone XS and XS Max had a normal camera and a telephoto camera with a 12MP sensor. And that may remain the same this time around too. The additional one is supposed to be an ultra-wide-angle lens, which would support the 120-degree field of view. However, the resolution of the ultra-wide-angle camera has not surfaced into the rumor market. Nonetheless, there are hints about Apple including OIS only on the main camera and a telephoto camera. Only the 5G variant could get an OIS on the ultra-wide-angle shooter. Apple is also said to be preparing on a more advanced flash, which would emit more light without an increment on the size of the LED. Furthermore, the new iPhones will reportedly come with smaller camera bumps.  On the front though, Apple could implement just a single selfie shooter. And just like last year, the upcoming iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max will come with 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display respectively. Just like last two years, the phone will also feature a sizable notch on the top, which would include Apple’s proprietary Face ID. There also news about Apple improving its Face ID system, which would allow the users to unlock their devices from wider angles. Further rumors hint that this feature would only unlock the Apple handsets from shorter distances.  As of now, there is no information if Apple would rejuvenate its popular Touch ID (fingerprint unlock) feature. However, Apple is said to be working on a new project where the under-display fingerprint scanner on the Apple devices could do a 3D mapping of the fingerprint and unlock the device securely. This new tech, Touch ID 2.0 is said to make a debut on 2020 edition of the iPhones.  Since the camera has been an important aspect on the smartphones these days, Apple is going a step further than just increasing the number of cameras. The company is preparing to upgrade its image signal processor (ISP) for fast and improved photography. This upgrade would also enhance the Smart HDR feature on the phone. Although there is not enough information regarding this topic, the tipsters have claimed the  “it’d be better than anything Google or Samsung or Huawei have done before.”  This certainly sounds interesting.  Further leaks suggest that the upcoming iPhones would feature a new frosted-glass-like coating. The devices are also said to come with less shiny stainless steel frame and upgraded stereo speaker setup that would produce a louder and clearer sound.  iOS 13 with tons of features  When Apple launches a new phone, it also includes the latest and improved software. And things are going to be the same thing time too. The iOS 13 will bring plentiful of amazing features. The first one would be the highly anticipated dark mode. However, the things won’t be deep AMOLED blacks on this mode. Apple is striding to include dark gray colors in this mode and it would support in the third-party apps as well.  Siri is also said to be enhanced on the new iPhones. The upgraded Siri will support advanced multi-command support, major improvements to overall understanding, and minor improvements to contextual understanding. Furthermore, there will be intelligent RAM management, which would learn users’ habits to pre-load apps helping to speed up the process. The developers inside Apple are also putting their efforts to make iOS 13 jailbreak proof.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iphone-11-max-leaks.jpg']

But since the true colors and design are not much visible in that image, we were still how the device would look when it launches.

['Here’s how your smartphone’s display is affecting your health'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 23, 2019']",2019-05-23 12:56:17+00:00,"['The OLED displays consist of self-luminous organic materials. Unlike the LCD display, which uses backlight, they have their own source of light. So these types of screens offer better contrast ratio than the LCD displays. Apart from that, OLED displays also portray amazing colors with deeper blacks. That’s why OLED displays are quite popular in the market. And in that context, the AMOLED displays are often remarked best because of their ability to showcase punchy colors with an astounding level of brightness. But while staying indoors and using smartphones during night time, we require a lower volume of brightness. And while lowering the display brightness, smartphones use either one of the two methods of dimming the display. And one of them is so fatal that it can create eyestrain, which can further proceed to trigger migraine and other health-related issues.  PWM Dimming  PWM actually stands for pulse width modulation. And it is one of the widely used display dimming technologies in the market. As the name implies, this technology varies the light pulse in the display to alter the amount of brightness in the screen. In this technology, the display brightness is adjusted by altering the on-time and off-time of the display. The display glows on full brightness but since the on-time and off-time are varied, human eyes perceive the average brightness that appears in the screen for the time. Higher the on-time, higher would be the brightness. Lower the on-time (or higher the off-time), lower would be the screen brightness.  Here is a pulse waveform, which can give a clear idea on the topic:        Source: OLED-info  As shown in the diagram above, when the brightness of the display is 100%, the screen remains on all the time. But when the brightness is dropped down to 50%, the on-time decreases. It remains on for 50% of the time and off for the remaining time. And the screen will toggle between these modes at a very high frequency, which can be indistinguishable to the human’s naked eyes.  Screen Flickering Source: OLED-info  You might have got the point that on decreasing the brightness further, the off-time increases as well. But while decreasing the display brightness at extremely lower levels, the off-time will be very high when compared with the on-time. And in that case, there will be a considerable flicker effect.  Disadvantages of PWM Dimming and Screen Flickering  Even at extremely lower values, the screen flickering won’t be yet noticeable to our eyes. Nonetheless, it will still create all sorts of discomforts. The PWM Dimming can arise distresses like eyestrain and headaches in the earlier phase and can even trigger migraines after long-term exposures. But researchers found that only 10% of the population are gravely affected with the PWM Dimming. Rest of the people either would be completely okay or would notice just mild discomforts because of it. But for those who get affected, the PWM dimming can cause other health-related issues as well.  The PWM Dimming is a digital means of adjusting the brightness. Although it is cost-effective, it has its own sorts of flaws. And to overcome the issues related to PWM Dimming, an analog means of display dimming technology was discovered. And it goes by the name of DC Dimming.  DC Dimming  To light the backlight of the LCD and tiny LEDs of the OLED display, it requires a power source. And while studying about the electricity, we learned power as the product of voltage and current (Power = Voltage x Current). So varying any of this quantity, we can control the power supply to the display and adjust the brightness. Although it sounds simple on the words, it is not that simple after all.   Source: Sparrows News  This technology was used on LCD displays in the past. But on the OLED displays, it hasn’t been much. Smartphone manufacturers have recently started to roll out this feature on their handsets. It was because of one major downside of the technology on OLED displays, which had caused smartphone makers not to use it much. While adjusting the display brightness to the lower values, the current/voltage supplied to the display decreases significantly. And this considerate decrease on the voltage/current won’t be sufficient to light all the RGB LEDs properly. So the colors portrayed by the screen usually vary from their true colors. The colors emitted by the screen can also change beyond identifiable limits at times, which could even change the way users perceive the quality of the display.  The optimum solution  To counteract the downsides of both of these technologies, smartphone makers have started providing both of these features on the OLED panels these days. The brightness of the display lowers using PWM Dimming technology by default.\xa0 And they include DC Dimming as an add-on feature on the setting. Those who get affected by the screen flickering issue due to PWM dimming, they can trigger the DC Dimming feature on and stay safe from the health hazards.  To address the issue, OnePlus rolled out a software update, which included DC Dimming feature on its  latest devices . Xiaomi did the same with its popular devices like  MI 8  and  MI 9 . Another Chinese company, Oppo, also made its  Oppo Reno smartphone  compatible with this feature. Since this feature is directly connected with the users’ health, other smartphone companies are also following the suit. Apart from the aforementioned brands, we have heard Vivo and Meizu working on it. So it might be a mainstream feature in all the smartphones in a year or two. But as of now, choose the smartphone display wisely if you are sensitive with the phone’s displays.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review.jpg']

But their chips use ARM technology, and many important parts in the Kirin chips are ARM’s design. There is no substitute for that right now. And without that, Huawei’s almost crippled. Of course, that is a given. Because without chips, how are they going to make phones? And it’s not only phones. Huawei also relies on ARM to design its  Kunpeng computer servers  chips, which provide cloud computing and storage to customers!   Now  ARM is not a US company . It is actually a Japanese subsidiary of SoftBank and has headquarters in the US. However, it has offices and plants in many other countries, and the USA is one of the more important ones. Also, many technologies in ARM’s design in those Kirin chips come from the US – like the Cortex processors and their Mali GPU. So, in compliance with the US ban, ARM is suspending its operations with Huawei, or its subsidiaries.  ARM instructed its employees via an internal memo to halt any ongoing and future transactions with Huawei. They claim that they’re only complying to the new policies, and are actually trying to resolve the matter as soon as possible. However, there are some reports that the  Kirin 985, which is supposed to be Huawei’s next flagship chip will not be affected for now . But this will severely affect other iterations of the same chip. And so, their upcoming Mate series is in jeopardy, along with their KunPeng server chips, too.  Huawei responded by saying that they valued their relationships with their partners but understood the pressure they’re in. And hoped that this matter will resolve soon. Also, Huawei has revealed that they have a stockpile of chips to last them over 3 months. And until then, this might blow over.  Still, if it doesn’t, Huawei is a large company. It probably has enough resources to come up with their own systems, just like their plan B operating system. However, their plan B was in the works since 2012. And making an entirely new chip might take just as long! So, right now, Huawei’s future is very uncertain…']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/arm-bans-huawei.jpg']

Of course, even if you bought them a while ago, if those phones are still working alright, why would you upgrade to a newer device, right? And if the latest software is your thing, you don’t have to worry about that either. Your  OnePlus 3 and 3T phones are getting Android Pie Updates!  Of course, when  Android Q  is just around the corner, this software update is a bit late. But for phones that launched with Android Marshmellow out of the box, this is a great update! Usually, phones get only 2 years of software updates promised. And Android Oreo was supposed to be the last one. Nevertheless, receiving Android Pie makes me a bit proud to be in the OnePlus community!  The new software update will come out as  OxygenOS 9.0.2 .\xa0 And with it, you’ll get the  security patch dated April 2019 . In addition, you’ll get to customize the time range in the “Do Not Disturb” mode, support for Google Duo video calls in the Dialer app itself, and Google Lens support in the camera; not to mention general bug fixes and improvements.        Also, there’s the  Gaming Mode 3.0 . This mode has support for displaying text content of the heads-up notifications, as well as notifications for third-party calls. Of course, all of the features will not really be useful. But the mere prospect of new major software is exciting enough.  The Android Pie updates have started rolling out.

From making music tracks viral to getting banned in some nations, this lip-syncing app comes into headlines time and often. But the ByteDance, the owner of Tiktok, is not yet going to rest enjoying the success of TikTok. The company is now on the verge of taking on  Spotify  and Apple Music making its own music platform.  TikTok has lately been an internet sensation, especially among teens and youngsters. It has already cherished over 500 million downloads. In that run, the app was also involved in making some of the songs in top of the charts. The No. 1 song in the world for the past month, “Old Town Road,” first became popular in videos on TikTok. This could be a turning point for the company owners to concentrate their focus on the music platform.  ByteDance plans to start its music-streaming platform on the developing countries. However, the representatives did not blurt out any of the country’s name. Nonetheless, the company has already collaborated and secured rights from T-series and Times music. Since T-series and Times music are the music companies from India, India could be one of the planned countries for the music platform. There are over 300 million monthly users in India. So it could as well be a good place to start for the company. Since the Middle East and Africa incorporates the majority of the world’s population but has merely 10% of Spotify’s customer base, this might as well be a great platform for the platform to boom.        ByteDance is yet to secure the rights from major labels like Universal, Warner, and Sony. If it gets the rights from these companies, it will ease the company for its expansion in America and European regions.  By the sound of it, the music platform quite sounds like already popular music platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. However, the representatives claim that this new app won’t be a clone to Spotify and Apple Music. It is rather supposed to include a catalog of songs available on-demand, as well as video. The platform is said to make a debut in the coming fall. However, there is no information regarding its official release date. So we are obliged to wait to get more details regarding the topic.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tiktok-launching-music-streaming-platform.jpg']
"['The complete story of Huawei, Android and those involved…']","['Google', 'Huawei', 'Opinion']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 22, 2019']",2019-05-22 11:30:25+00:00,"['Huawei is on a roll. To be completely honest, it was on a roll from quite a while ago.  Surpassing Apple to become the second largest smartphone company , and having a surge in sales while others reported a decline in sales. Well, Huawei is, still, on a roll…just in the opposite direction!  I don’t think this will come as news to you. It’s no news that following the US government’s sanctions, Google has revoked Huawei’s Android license. This is a grave matter of concern. And as we discuss this, you’ll really need to strap in. But here’s a TLDR too!  TLDR: The Summary  Long story short,  Google revoked Huawei’s license to use the Android platform  on its devices. That comes after the orders from the US government forbidding US companies to carry out transactions with the company. And so, Huawei will no longer be able to use Android and other Google services in their products.        This doesn’t mean your current Huawei phones are in danger. They will continue to operate. So, if you, recently, bought a  Huawei P30 Pro  or a P30, or any other Huawei device for that matter, they will work as it is. You will be able to use Google’s products like maps and access the Play Store without restrictions. You’ll even be able to update those apps of yours. Google made it clear that your present Huawei phones will still work fine and dandy.  However, the ban means that your Huawei devices will not get future updates – software, or, otherwise. The problem starts with the future. No OS updates, or security patches. In addition, future Huawei devices cannot run Android, at all.  To be clear,  Android is a free open-source platform , which means, Huawei can still use the base of the Android framework to develop their own. But that creates its own source of problems, because, they still won’t be able to use Google apps and services like Location, GPS, and other apps like Gmail and YouTube, to name a few.  Of course, Huawei has responded to this by claiming they will continue providing updates for current phones, and also that  they have a plan B in place . So, it’s not all bad.  But not only Google, US firms like  Intel  and  Qualcomm  will also stop providing chips to the company. So, their laptop lineup is in jeopardy, too. For the time being, the US has given them a  90-day lift on the ban . In this time, they can purchase US products necessary to maintain their current network and tech, but not for building new ones. Will this time be enough? Or maybe the two will come to some sort of agreement. That remains to be seen. But for now, Huawei has already stated they won’t bow down to pressure. So, all eyes on them!  The Story: All you need to know  Where do we begin?  Huawei  It started in 1987, when  Ren Zhengfei , a retired deputy director of the People’s Liberation Army in China, founded the company. Initially, it focused on developing phone switches while spending vigorously on R&D as well. It went on to develop networking technologies and soon, moved to smartphones and consumer products. In 2005, it had a 5% share in the global smartphone market! Fast forward to this year (before the ban), it holds the second position in the market.   Not only that, Huawei is the leading company in 5G technology right now. It has contracts with many countries for the development of 5G infrastructure, including Nepal. Huawei’s 5G equipment is considered cheaper and more advanced than from others, like Qualcomm. But herein, lies the accusation – that Huawei’s 5G firmware has a “backdoor”. This backdoor can apparently be used to acquire any information that passes through. And so, poses grave security issues.  Accusations  Now, this is not the first time Huawei has been accused of posing security risks. Currently,  Huawei faces almost 2 dozen criminal charges  filed by the US authority! And some say that Huawei is really the most controversial company right now.  Back in 2003, Huawei was accused of stealing the intellectual property of US-based organizations like Cisco – the network hardware maker. In 2014, it was accused of technology theft from Tappy – a phone testing robot from T-Mobile, which was settled in a Civil lawsuit. In between, there has been a lot of such.  We won’t go into all the accusations in detail. The point is, Huawei has been accused of such things, time and again. But we haven’t heard of any grave consequences of such actions, and so, we cannot really say what Huawei’s up to. The accusations go from technology theft to fraud, to stealing military secrets from the US, to sabotage US infrastructure.  Also,  Meng Wangzhou , CFO of Huawei and Ren Zhengfei’s daughter, was  arrested in Canada (December 2018) , on the US orders, for bank fraud and technology theft. But, moreover, it was for her involvement with Skycom and doing business with Iran, which is against US sanctions. Both Huawei and Meng have denied the accusations, but this has led to rising tensions between China, the US, and even Canada!  The Reason  Now Huawei faces a lot of accusations, almost all of them from the US government. This may lead people to believe that it’s, in fact, the US govt. that is biased towards the company. But there are some valid reasons behind the accusations.  First, as aforementioned, Ren Zhengfei, the founder and CEO of Huawei, served in the People’s Liberation Army back in the days. Being the one behind developing technology for the army, and as the deputy director of the army, he has very close ties with the Chinese government. So, the US suspects the company of spying on other governments using their 5G technology in collaboration with the Chinese government.  Is that enough base to accuse a whole company of such charges? No. But the  Chinese government uses aggressive surveillance tools in their country  on the people and all other entities. So Huawei, being a Chinese company, is bound to be under close surveillance as well. In addition, Zhengfei’s close ties to the Chinese govt. only adds fuel to the fire.  If it weren’t reason enough,  China, back in 2017, passed the NIL (National Intelligence Law) . This law states that “ If asked, the Chinese companies and citizens must help the government and assist in National intelligence efforts”.\xa0 While China claims that is to safeguard their own security, it can be used to exploit Huawei’s data via the “secret backdoors” in Chinese 5G technology.  And why is this so scary? Apart from military secrets and data, the  application of 5G is much more than faster communication . 5G opens new areas like controlling water-reservoir dams, and national power grids, data centers, and every other significant national infrastructure. If Huawei is, indeed, guilty of all these, they will actually have the power to freeze the nations with a single snap! So, there is a good reason for paranoia, if you think about it.  However, Huawei claims that they have always maintained independence, and many of these accusations are a result of the  US-China Trade War !  The US-China Trade War  Now, this is something that has been going on for some time, and frankly, is very comprehensive. For the two strongest economies in the world, to have at it is, well, natural, I think. But president Trump complained about China’s trade practices before he took office in 2016. And after he did, well…  According to BBC , the US launched investigations into Chinese trade policies in 2017. Also, it imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese products in 2018. In addition, there was a hike in duties from 10% to 25% on over $250 billion Chinese goods recently – not only to discourage the use of Chinese products inside the US but also to promote their own.  Beijing hit back with tariffs of their own on about $110 billion worth of US goods in their country. And so, the  biggest trade war  in history began. And many believe that this is why the US is trying to corner Huawei – as it’s on its way to becoming the leading telecommunications company in the world. Because Huawei’s 5G equipment is cheaper and has a more advanced tech. So, others might prefer Huawei over others. But, with these accusations in place, many countries are reluctant to use Huawei’s technology now. So, is this all a clever ploy?  We really can’t tell. But here’s the current scenario.  Present  Huawei faces a growing backlash from Western countries led by the US over the possible risks posed by its products in the next-gen 5G networks. The US leads the campaign against Huawei, both in terms of making the case about security threats it poses, and also legal cases alleging the firm of intellectual property theft and fraud.  And due to this,  many countries have restricted the use of Huawei’s 5G equipment in their countries . Japan, France, and the Czech Republic are already on board with this, while Germany is reviewing their policies. Australia already banned Huawei’s components last year and ZTE’s too. However, the UK is still positive about Huawei. The UK states that they will continue using Huawei’s equipment, but in a controlled way so that even if there’s a threat, they can monitor it themselves.  What’s interesting, here, is that the US, UK, and Australia are the 3 members of an  Intelligence Sharing Pact  called the  Five Eyes Alliance . And while New Zealand, one of the other members also banned Huawei, Canada is still on the fence. And with the UK supporting Huawei, New Zealand and Canada might even reconsider.  In addition, Huawei is trying to make amends. It is willing to sign no-spy agreements with governments as concerns over the security of its products used in the mobile network continues to grow. Of course, it’s not doing a good job of convincing them, as we can see. Huawei is already on the  US’s Entity List , which is also considered as the “Death Penalty”. Companies, in this list, cannot do business with any US companies or entities. ZTE was in this list too, which was revoked after  ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine  and close surveillance to the company.  The Android Scenario  Back to the topic at hand, here are the details regarding Google’s ban on Huawei.  This comes after the US sanctions following the accusations of Huawei spying and other allegations in place. It’s not only Google, but all US firms are restricted from doing business with Huawei. However, as this is the one which impacts the company the most, it receives the most attention.  Source: Twitter  Google, however, made it clear that Huawei’s current phones will continue working without any problems. They will get all app updates and Google services. It is because the present devices are already certified under  CTS (Compatibility Test Suite)  and  VTS (Vendor Test Suite) . Once a phone goes through them, the phone is fully functional in all aspects. Even the  Honor 20 , that launched very recently amidst the chaos is fully functional.  The only problem lies in the security patches and software updates that Huawei devices won’t receive. While Huawei runs on EMUI, it can create its own patches and updates, but it will take a lot of time. As Huawei responded saying they will continue providing sustainable software updates, it will, nonetheless, take time to arrive on Huawei phones.  This is because Google gives Android device makers their software fixes codes about a month before it makes it public about vulnerabilities in the current system. And this gives manufacturers enough time to check the patches so that it won’t cause problems for their own proprietary software and then package up a customized version of the fixes. But now, Huawei will learn of such patches at the same time as they’re released on the AOSP. So, security updates will be delayed.  Furthermore, a more grave problem lies for upcoming Huawei devices. The new phones, even if they can use the AOSP (Android Open Source Platform) to develop their own software, they can’t call it Android. Because  Android is actually a brand of Google  and with the revoked license, they don’t have the Android certificate anymore.  Not being able to call their software Android seems like it’s a minor inconvenience. But this means a lot more. Google is suspending all business activities with Huawei related to “non-public” transfers of hardware, software, and technical services. This means  Huawei won’t have access to :   The Google Play app store  Google apps like Calendar, Music, Google Photos  Google Assistant  Gmail and YouTube  Tools that allow 3rd-party services access to certain functions   Let’s break it down. First, no play store means no viable way of downloading all the apps that are on your phone. Okay, let’s say they create their own app store. But getting developers to create apps for them will require a lot of investment, which investors may not be willing to. Now there are alternative stores that can help you access apps like those. But again, Google prevents its own apps from being installed on uncertified phones, so, there’s that as well.  The 2nd might be just an inconvenience. They can easily replicate those apps. Also, Google Assitant is, right now, the best virtual assistant there is. But they might be able to create their own virtual assistant as well. So, no big deal.  Gmail and YouTube. Okay, I can’t imagine my life without those two. These two tools are part of my daily life, and not a day goes by without me using them. Granted, we’ll still be able to access them via a different mobile browser. But the experience is not just the same! This has to be the biggest let down!  Of course, a more serious matter is  the tools that make Android, Android . For example, Push notifications is something that enables apps like Facebook and Twitter to send notifications to your phone. So, without this, no more notifications! Also, there are many other aspects Huawei won’t be able to use…so, it seems like they’re doomed!  Furthermore, other companies like  Qualcomm and Intel will also stop business activities with Huawei . Now, Qualcomm’s restriction may not be that threatening. After all, Huawei makes their own chips. But Intel is their sole supplier for their laptop line, such as the  Huawei MateBook X . So, their laptop line up is under even more pressure.!  But this is, after  the 90-day ultimatum . This ultimatum allows Huawei to purchase products from these US firms to maintain their existing network. However, they cannot purchase equipment to create newer technologies.  Huawei’s Response   Huawei already responded to this, of course. They claim that they are not bowing down, and even praised the US firms for trying to convince the US authorities against this decision. Yet, they seem to be calm even under all this fire. They claim to have a stockpile of chips to last them months. And who knows? Until then, this might all be over too.  Also, they have a plan B in place. Plan B comes in the form of an entirely new operating system, that was, apparently,  in the works since 2012 . Huawei foresaw this situation might come someday, and started working on their own OS. And reportedly, the  new OS is called “Hongmeng” . If this comes into play, it could even change the whole smartphone market!  But as we already discussed, with a new OS comes new problems. A new ecosystem might not be appealing to all the people. They’ll have to make their own app store, which requires convincing developers and investors, too.  But my concern is will they be able to pull it off? A whole new ecosystem competing alongside Android and iOS. Because we’ve seen others try and fail! Nokia and Microsoft tried pushing Windows phones. They were decent phones, but they failed because they couldn’t convince developers to develop apps for their Windows stores.  Samsung developed its own  Tizen OS  because it claimed Android had a very large grip over everything. While Tizen OS only made it popular enough for their smartwatches, Android actually loosened its grip, because, maybe it sensed a threat! So, I have quite mixed feelings about the new OS from Huawei.  And a part of the mixed feelings includes suspicions, too. Because,  I f Huawei already foresaw this, that something like this was coming, were they really doing something not-so-good , and this is their contingency plan?  What’s Next?  Okay…so what’s next for Huawei and others?  In the short term , Huawei phones won’t sell well. That is all. Because who wants a phone without Android? Not many. As for Android Q, it is uncertain if it’ll make it to upcoming Huawei phones. Because, most of their source code might have already been shared, as such is the norm in the smartphone industry.  This is the result of only Android restriction. Not talking about other repercussions like countries banning Huawei technology. Because who knows what’s next for that? Things are getting way too political for taste, and let’s not step into that.  In the long-term , however, things might turn out good. Smartphone vendors might get a good reason to seriously consider the need for a viable alternative to Google’s Android! And at a time when Google’s pushing out its own Pixel brand! Right now, iOS and Android are the leaders. And starting with Huawei, other Chinese phones might rally behind a new ecosystem. This can be a turning point for the whole smartphone industry.  Winners and Losers  In any situation, there are always winners and losers. And in this, there are quite a few in both.  On the losing side, it’s, of course, Huawei and Honor that take the first hit. Phones not selling well to brand image going down, we know the consequences too well. Users, like us, might lose a good smartphone brand. Google themselves, are losing a major player. Android might face tough competition with a new ecosystem. And of course, component suppliers such as Qualcomm and Intel will need new customers as well.  However, there are winners. Xiaomi, which is the  4th largest smartphone company , might rise up to the occasion. Apple, of course, if this continues, might get back to 2nd! And then there are BKK subsidiaries like Oppo, Realme and OnePlus, who will be more than happy to fill the gaps created.  Rounding up & Opinions  So, what can we make of all this? Actually, there is just so much going around that we cannot come to a specific conclusion.  My first thought? President Trump and the US government is paranoid and biased. They’re using their power to corner one of the best smartphone companies in the world, and have a shot at their economy! What does that bring them? Money and Power, of course! Besides the US-China Trade War, this is also about the 5G Race!  It’s a race Huawei’s winning with its superior and more affordable tech . So, this is just another dirty trick to win the 5G race. Winning that would mean the  creation of 3 million jobs and a $500 billion dollar growth in the US GDP …which would ensure its position as the largest economy in the world. In addition, controlling 5G means controlling the world…in some way, as information is power these days. So, this is nothing but a clever ploy…  Because if they were really concerned about data privacy and security, what about Facebook? The company who stole and sold data of millions of people, of not only US citizens, but people all around the world? And the Cambridge Analytica scandal…  But again, I can’t say Huawei’s innocent either. The fact that they had a plan B since a while ago, for circumstances such as this, raises suspicions. And Huawei’s 5G equipment is receiving bans as it apparently has a backdoor on the firmware. This issue cannot be rectified with software, so, those who are using Huawei’s 5G services might really be exposed. And if this is, indeed the case, how can we believe that their new OS won’t be spying on us?  Yet, I, or any of us, cannot be pointing fingers. Because nothing is proven, yet. None of the allegations have been proven. And if we try to analyze a certain aspect, it goes in too deep. We’re better off not drawing conclusions. Let’s just hope for the best consequences for everyone. That is all!  But by the time you’re reading this, a lot could have changed, too!  Update 1:\xa0 Seems like Google revoking Huawei’s license is the least of its worries.  Huawei has its ARM cut off, too!  Update 2:\xa0 SD Association removed Huawei from its membership too. SD Association is a trade group that agrees on the standards of SD cards. But with the revoking of membership, Huawei phones will no longer be able to include microSD cards in their phones. One after the other, companies are banning the tech giant. However, this may not affect them in a very severe manner, as they are already developing their own proprietary nano-memory cards for their phones. Only their mid-range and budget lineup might suffer for a while until they come up with nano storage for those too!  Update 3:\xa0 And after SD cards, Huawei is also banned from the WiFi Alliance – which influences decisions regarding Wireless technology. WiFi Alliance is a group consisting mostly of American technologies, so, in compliance with the US Government’s decision, it has banned Huawei. However, the ban is temporary for now, and it didn’t revoke Huawei membership – just temporarily banned Huawei from influencing the decisions they make.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/huawei-ban-thanos.jpg']

Although Sony is yet to go all out and release the product, it has already divulged most of the feature of the upcoming Sony PlayStation 5.  The Japanese tech giant all in its audacity mentioned some of the impressive features about of the PS5 in its  Investor Relations Strategy Meeting (IR 2019) . The company did not even hesitate to compare the last gen of PlayStation (PS4 Pro) with the upcoming one (PS5). In the presentation by Sony Interactive Entertainment, a Sony official demonstrated the faster loading on the PS5. Compared it with the PS4 Pro, the PS5 was almost ten times faster on the load time.   Sony’s official video comparing performance of PS4 Pro vs next-gen PlayStation  pic.twitter.com/2eUROxKFLq  — Takashi Mochizuki (@mochi_wsj)  May 21, 2019         The official also continued the demonstration by showing the gameplay. In the PS5, the game ran without any noticeable slowdown and without any signs of lags and stutters. And it has been possible because of its highly powerful 7nm octa-core processor (from AMD) and a high-speed Solid State Drive (SSD). To offer more immersive gaming experience, Sony has also included a capable graphics card on the board (AMD’s Radeon Navi family). The device is said to support Ray Tracing, a technology to create surreal visual effects using dynamic lighting and reflections.   Apart from that, the upcoming gaming console is said to support 8K graphics. So the users will be able to make most out of their 8K TVs. The device also supports physical discs. So if the users don’t have storage left on the inbuilt SSD, they can use Blu-ray discs as well to play the games. The PlayStation 5 will also come with streaming support. Furthermore, the PS5 will come with a superior audio system to offer an immersive 3D audio.   Despite all the advancements, the new PlayStation will still be backward compatible. That means users can even play PS4/PS4 Pro games on the PS5. And bringing the PS5, Sony won’t give up on the PS4/PS4 Pro just yet. The company will still continue its support to the last gen devices for the next three years.   Although Sony has announced almost all of the features on the upcoming PS4, the company has still kept of the things under the veil. The price is still yet to be known. Also, there is no information about the countries, where Sony will roll out its next PS5. The Tokyo-based company has explicitly explained that the next PlayStation would support Ray Tracing games but the name of the games is still under the closed veil. That info will probably out on the official launch event.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sony-playstaion-5-teased.jpg']

Well, not Google, but Google’s camera – the  GCam , which is so kindly developed by some experts from XDA Developers, for other phones as well.  To see if your phone supports GCam or not, you need to download the  Camera 2 API app   and check it.

I tested the camera prowess of the device in 4 different settings – Normal Mode, Portrait Mode, Night Mode, and Selfies.        Normal Mode  Here’s the first image sample.

The GCam preserves the details and looks better than the overexposed image of the stock camera, but there’s some increased contrast and shadow details are crushed. Yet, it still looks better than the stock camera photo.      Normal Mode Stock Camera and Gcam   1  of 2               Gcam         Stock Camera                  With the 3 rd  image, it does the same thing. The Stock camera loses a significant amount of details. The texture on the roof is next to non-existent and the leaves on the trees look mushy. There are very fewer shadow details, and if you look at the central pillar inside, the texture is lost completely.      Normal Mode Stock Camera and Gcam   1  of 2               GCam         Stock camera                  By now, it should be evident that the stock camera sucks compared to GCam. Here, too, the textures of the bricks are lost, the leaves on the trees look very soft, and the electric wires nearby are wiped out.      Normal Mode on Stok Camera and Gcam   1  of 2               GCam         Stock camera                  Okay, here’s the last one of the Color test. Again, the stock camera fails to bring true colors in the images. But at least, here, the details are as good as the one on GCam.      Normal Mode Stock Camera and Gcam   1  of 2               GCam         Stock camera                  Portrait Mode on Gcam  Let’s move on to portraits now. The portraits on the GCam are zoomed in, by default but there’s an option in the camera settings to disable that.  Okay, here’s the first portrait on both. And it’s easy to see that the stock portrait looks fuzzy, has fewer details and washed out colors. But despite doing that well, the GCam suffers on the edge detection slightly. Contrast is also a bit too high, but since the facial details are there, GCam wins.        1  of 2               GCam         Stock Camera                  In this portrait, the colors are again, washed out on the stock camera. Just look at the shirt and jeans! The GCam, on the other hand, maintains a good amount of contrast and looks more natural, but again, suppressed highlights on the hair.        1  of 2               GCam         Stock Camera                  In this image, GCam’s deeper blacks make the colors look better. The skin tone and texture are well maintained too.        1  of 2               GCam         Stock Camera                  Here, with a harsh light on the background, GCam’s edge detection is poor. But it still manages to preserve details and maintain the natural skin tone.        1  of 2               GCam         Stock camera                  In low light portraits, there is not much difference between the two. But the image from GCam shot looks slightly brighter.        1  of 2               GCam         Stock camera                  So, I fairly like GCam’s portraits, and most of the results are fairly consistent. When used right, you can also get nearly perfect shots like this!        1  of 2               Gcam Portrait         Gcam Normal                   Selfies from Gcam  Moving to the selfie department, there’s the mirror effect on the GCam, and I couldn’t find any modes to turn it off. But if you can get past that, the GCam has better colors and details – from the natural skin color to the textures.        1  of 2               Gcam Normal Selfie         Stock Camera Normal Selfie                  The result is the same with portrait selfies too. Background blurs look more natural on the GCam as well.        1  of 2               GCam portrait Selfie         Stock Camera Portrait Selfie                  But edge detection is not always perfect on the GCam. If you look at this part, here, some part of the background is also in focus.        1  of 2               GCam portrait Selfie         Stock Camera Portrait Selfie                  So, it appears that the GCam is the clear winner here. But still, I wanted to compare these in low light, and since there’s Night Mode on both, why not?  Night Sight Feature on Gcam  And these are the first images in low light settings, but with Night Mode turned off on both. Here, the stock camera overexposes the highlights, and colors look washed out. In fact, the stock camera fails to capture the true colors, and gradients are nowhere to be found on the image from the stock camera.        1  of 2               GCam Low Light Sample         Stock Camera Low Light Sample                  Here’s another similar shot. The stock camera produces a mushy image, while the GCam manages to pull in better colors and more details while maintaining the contrast.        1  of 2               GCam No Night Mode         Stock Camera No Night Mode                  And then, here are some shots with the Night Mode turned on. The fact that a phone like Redmi Note 7 features a night mode is impressive, but how does this fare alongside GCam’s Night Sight? Let’s see.  This is a normal shot from the Stock Camera. The temple’s artifacts aren’t really visible and water painting effect is gone. With the Night mode turned on, there’s a slight improvement, but it still lacks details. On the other hand, the pictures on the GCam gets better with the Night Sight on.        1  of 4               Stock Camera No Night Mode         Stock Camera Night Mode         Gcam No Night Mode         Gcam Night Mode                        On this stock image, too, the highlights are overblown but seems a bit controlled with the Night Mode. There’s also an extra pinch of details on the Night mode image, but the colors are still faded. GCam’s Night Sight, however, has true colors but quite preserved the details and highlights.        1  of 4               Stock Camera No Night Mode         Stock Camera Night Mode         Gcam No Night Mode         Gcam Night Mode                        On this image, the level of details is more or less similar down to the colors, so, can’t really tell the difference between the two.        1  of 4               Stock Camera No Night Mode         Stock Camera Night Mode         Gcam No Night Mode         Gcam Night Mode 8                        Okay, this is the image where the stock camera seems to do a better job than the GCam. And so, I had to take this on the GCam twice to double check. However, in both the images, the highlights are overexposed while the stock camera controls it pretty well. The Buddha’s face is clearly visible here. However, GCam is still better in terms of colors.        1  of 4               Stock Camera No Night Mode         Stock Camera Night Mode         Gcam No Night Mode         Gcam Night Mode                        For all the high-res images,  Click here .  Conclusion  So, there you have it. From all the images in the comparison, it’s clear that GCam does better by bringing true colors, preserving details and maintaining good contrast. Portraits are also impressive and the selfies are remarkable. Although not perfect, with the GCam installed, you can actually turn the Redmi Note 7 into an amazing camera phone!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-review.jpg']

This launch comes amidst Huawei’s current issues with the US Government and Google which was not discussed on the event today. The officials didn’t even mention anything about the software of the devices, which was quite odd. But yes, they do have google applications preinstalled!  Honor 20 Pro Overview  Today’s launch event talked a lot about the design of the Honor 20 Pro, and I really have to say that it’s gorgeous. This device has a three-layered glass back that reflect a variety of colors when it hits the light. The names of the colors, the Honor 20 Pro comes with, is confusing, though. This device has a 6.26-inch IPS LCD punch hole display that has a decreased surface area than  Honor View 20 . With the size, this phone can be used with one-hand which is turning out to be a rarity as phones are getting taller.  The major focus of the Honor 20 series is the camera, and the 20 Pro has four of them. At first glance, the alignment reminded me of the  Huawei P30 Pro ‘s camera setup.         This device has a 48-megapixel f/1.4 primary camera that has the same sensor used on the  OnePlus 7 Pro . Honor boasted about the wide aperture and the sensor size of this primary camera at the event. There is a 16-megapixel wide-angle camera accompanied by an 8-megapixel 3x telephoto lens.  While other manufacturers opt for a depth sensor as their fourth camera, Honor has gone a different way equipping the 20 Pro with a 2-megapixel macro camera. This camera setup has received a score of 111 from DxOMark. For selfies, the phone has a 32-megapixel camera inside the punch hole.  The Honor 20 Pro runs on Android v9.0 Pie with Honor Magic UI on top as a skin. Honor has confirmed that this phone will feature google apps but the certainty of further updates is questionable due to the new trade war.   The Honor 20 Pro has a side-mounted fingerprint scanner that doubles as a power button. It comes with a 4,000 mAh battery that is supported by the 22.5W Honor SuperCharge fast charging technology. The company has claimed that it will charge up 50% of battery in just 30 minutes.  Honor 20 Pro Specifications   Display : 6.26-inches IPS LCD, Full HD+, 19.5:9 aspect ratio  CPU : HiSilicon Kirin 980  GPU : Mali-G76 MP10  OS : Android 9.0 Pie with Magic UI 2.1 on top  RAM : 8 GB  Storage : 256 GB  Rear camera : Quad – 48 MP, f/1.4 (primary) + 16 MP, f/2.2 (ultra-wide) + 8 MP, f/2.4 (telephoto) + 2 MP, f/2.4 (macro)  Front Camera : 32 MP, f/2.0  Battery : 4,000 mAh non-removable Li-Po battery, 22.5W Honor SuperCharge  SIM(s) : Dual SIM  Sensors : Fingerprint (side-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, and Compass   Honor 20 Overview  The Honor 20 is similar to the Honor 20 Pro in quite a lot of aspects but has a few subtle differences. It has the same 6.26-inch IPS LCD display with a punch hole on the top. The device is powered by the same HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset but comes with 6 GB RAM. It has the same software configuration as well.   The Honor 20 also has four cameras on the back. While three of those, the 48 MP primary, 16 MP wide-angle and 2 MP macro shooter, are the same, there is a 2-megapixel f/2.4 depth sensor instead of the 3x telephoto lens on the Pro model. The front-facing camera setup is the same as the 20 comes with a 32-megapixel selfie camera.  The Honor 20 is backed by a 3,750 mAh battery which is enabled with the same 22.5W fast charging technology. The device also features a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.

The device is quite cheaper than its siblings but doesn’t compromise on quality. The Honor 20 Lite is actually the  Honor 10i  that was launched in March.   The Honor 20 Lite sports a 6.21-inch Full HD+ display that surrounds a waterdrop notch on the top. This device is powered by the octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 710 processor aided by Mali-G51 MP4 GPU and 4 GB of RAM. The phone also runs on Android 9.0 Pie like the other two Honor 20 devices.  The Honor 20 Lite comes with triple rear cameras. There is a 24 MP primary lens with f/1.8 aperture, an 8 MP ultra-wide camera, and a 2 MP depth sensor. Up front lies a 32-megapixel selfie shooter embedded on the notch.  The Honor 20 Lite has a 3,400 mAh battery. There is a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner on the device.

Also Read:  MSI Laptops price in Nepal  Starting off with the specs, this one sports a huge 17.3″ IPS display with a resolution of 1920x1080px. The panel comes with a refresh rate of 144Hz and covers 100% of the sRGB color spectrum. It’s also pretty responsive at 3ms, something gamers will more than rejoice over. Sadly the display isn’t G-Sync compatible.        The display bezels are pretty tiny, and we mean XPS level tiny, 5.7mm to be precise on all three sides. This allows it to hold a footprint of a much smaller laptop while at the same time fitting a 17-inch display and inside your average backpack. Plus the webcam is still at the top.   Then there is the steel series keyboard with RGB backlit. There is a 51Wh battery which is pretty tiny for a laptop this big, so don’t expect good battery life. You get dual-band ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, and a nice set of ports selection.  Also Read:\xa0 MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8SF – Is RTX 2070 an overkill?

It’s a successor to the quite successful Core i7-8750H and boasts an improvement of somewhere around 5-10%.   The processor is paired by a dual channel 16GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM.

They literally have like 2 or 3 variants of the same product, especially, in the budget category. We’ve already seen phones like Redmi 4,  Redmi 4X , Redmi 4A,  Redmi 4 Prime … Well, you get the point. And similarly, we’re getting another variant of the  Redmi 7 , besides the  Redmi 7S , called the  Redmi 7A !  Redmi 7A Rumors  The Redmi 7A is, still, in its rumor stages, though. But I won’t be surprised if you haven’t heard of this, either. Budget phones such as this don’t get much spotlight, do they? More so, for a super budget phone, like this. Because the Redmi 7 is a budget phone as it is, and this is an even more toned down variant of that phone.  Source:  TENAA  Still, rumors are flying around about the Redmi 7A. Some images were listed on the Chinese site,  TENAA , with a bunch of specs. And according to that, we’re looking at a super budget phone.        The Redmi 7A appears to have a matte finish on the plastic back, moving away from that glossy finish. But it’s a super budget phone after all. It will also have a smaller display of  5.45″ with HD resolution , with a chin at the bottom with the Redmi branding. There will only be a  single camera of 13 MP at the back , and a  5 MP front camera . Also, this phone will be running on the  Snapdragon 435 , a considerable downgrade over the Redmi 7. In addition, it will come in  three RAM variants – 2 GB, 3 GB and a 4 GB model  with 16 / 32 / 64 GB RAM.  TENAA lists the battery at  3900 mAh , while some are claiming 4000 mAh. But of course, that is a pretty tiny amount of difference. The Redmi 7A will run on  MIUI 10 based on Android Pie , and I have my doubts if it will be able to perform all that well. There are no words on the price or availability yet. So, let’s see what this Redmi 7A will bring.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/redmi-7a-rumors.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy A70 review: A big phone with plenty of power!'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 20, 2019']",2019-05-20 09:53:30+00:00,"[""Samsung has been aggressively expanding its midrange lineup with the A-series. And in that wide variety of smartphones, we were particularly intrigued by the  Samsung Galaxy A70 . A tall phone with a big battery and plenty of features tucked in its svelte body. And that was enough to get us excited on the first glance. But has it pleased me over the course of 1 month of use? Well, we are going to answer that in this Samsung Galaxy A70 review.   Samsung Galaxy A70 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.7-inch Super AMOLED Infinity-U display  Resolution:\xa0 Full-HD+ (2400×1080 pixels); 20:9 aspect ratio  CPU:\xa0 octa-core (2×2.0 GHz Kryo 460 Gold & 6×1.7 GHz Kryo 460 Silver)  Chipset:  Snapdragon 675  RAM:\xa0 6GB  Storage:\xa0 128GB; Expandable up to 512GB (Dedicated SD Card Slot)  OS & UI:\xa0 Android 9.0 (Pie) with Samsung’s OneUI on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Triple camera – (32 MP, f/1.7, PDAF) + (8 MP, f/2.2, 12mm, (ultrawide)) + (5 MP, f/2.2, depth sensor), LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 32MP, f/2.0  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (under display), Gyro, accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 4500mAh with 25watt fast charging support; USB Type-C port  Colors:\xa0 Blue, Coral, and Black  Price:  Rs. 47,990  Rs. 40,799   Design  Let’s start the things with the design. The phone comes with a 3D Glasstic back and an aluminum frame wraps the device. And with this combination, the device looks awfully similar to the cheaper  Galaxy A30  and  A50  devices. At this price, we usually expect a glass back. But that’s not the case here. Nonetheless, the Glasstic back look quite pleasing with its shimmering rainbow effect.              1  of 4               Glastic Back with Shimmering Rainbow Effect         Ports         Power and Volume Buttons         SIM Card Tray                        Despite being a huge phone, the phone is relatively light when it comes to weight. But it does not feel that cheap when held in the hands. It is quite ergonomically designed that the weight is evenly distributed so as to offer convenience while holding it in the hands. All thanks to the glass-looking plastic material on the back. However, this Glasstic back is also a fingerprint magnet and gets scratched quite easily. So putting on a case is a must.  But what impressed me the most was the lack of camera bump on the back. Unlike the  Vivo V15 Pro  and  Oppo F11 Pro , the A70 has an ignorable camera bump so it does not rock in the plain surface. Not a deal breaker for the most, but there is that.  Display  Now let’s talk about the display. The phone comes with a tall 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display. With a big size of the display, the phone is primarily targeted at multimedia enthusiasts. The display also comes with a tiny U-shaped notch on the top, which is not as obtrusive. With the Super AMOLED panel on the board, the colors really pop on the device.  And the Full-HD+ resolution ensures sharp contents on the screen. However, the display on this device comes with a quirky 20:9 aspect ratio.   Samsung claims that the company has incorporated this weird aspect ratio to offer cinematic experience while viewing the contents. However, I couldn’t quite find the videos matching the aspect ratio. While viewing videos at univisium or 18:9 aspect ratio, I ended up with black bars on the left and right. And while viewing contents on an Ultrawide cinema or 21:9 aspect ratio, there were black bars on the top and the bottom. So I couldn’t quite experience the immersive cinematic experience Samsung promised.   But while browsing other contents, there are no issues whatsoever. With a tiny notch on the top and thin bezels, the screen looks immersive. The chin is as thin as Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S10. So the Galaxy A70 certainly deserves the praise on this respect. Also, the display here is significantly bright. So even on the broad daylight, the contents on the screen can be viewed very easily. That means the A70 has got almost everything covered in the display department.   But the major missing on this device is a notification LED. So you have to make use of the Always On Feature to keep track of the notifications on the Lock Screen mode.  Performance  In the past, Samsung was quite stingy when it comes to performance. But that’s not the case anymore. Samsung has employed Snapdragon 675 chipset on this device, which is a capable processor in the midrange category. With this processor on the board, the performance was really smooth. Normal apps and games run without any hiccups. Since the phone comes with an ample 6GB of RAM, multitasking, and switching between apps is not a problem either.  I even played some graphics-intensive games on this device. And there is nothing to complain here too. PUBG is playable at high settings and during the gameplay, I did not notice any sort of lags and stutters. Even while playing Asphalt 9, there was no any sort of frame drops either.  However, in the prolonged sessions, the smartphone tends to get slightly warm. Since the temperature doesn’t rise to the level to cause discomfort on the use, I won’t really call it a heating issue. Also, I don’t exactly know if it is the poor cooling system or the scorching sun, which caused that slight rise in temperature.  Talking about the memory, the phone comes aboard with 128GB of internal storage. Well, that’s quite a lot and I could barely fill even half of the storage during my use. So if you are planning to get this device, you may not fall short on the storage front. Even if you do, there is a dedicated SD card slot and you can make use of it to expand the storage up to 512GB.  Samsung Galaxy A70 Benchmark Scores   AnTuTu v7 : 168,559  CPU : 78543,  GPU : 33564,  UX : 46985,  Memory : 9467    AndroBench :  Sequential Read : 509.66 MB/s  Sequential Write : 192.27 MB/s    Geekbench 4   Single-core : 2394,  Multi-core : 6492,  RenderScript Score : 6122    PC Mark   Work 2.0 : 7672    3D Mark   Slighshot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1:\xa0 975  Slighshot Extreme Vulkan:  1065     Software & UI  On the software side, you get the latest Android Pie out of the box. And like most of Samsung’s latest phones, this one also comes with Samsung’s custom skin One UI on the top. Although Samsung has designed the One UI for single-handed use, this phone is so big that it’s barely usable with a single hand.   However, the phone comes with tons of features on the board. And since most of them are customizable, you can easily tune the device to your liking. Among all the features inside, I am quite fond of the Night Mode. With this mode turned on, the notification shade and the setting run on a black theme. So in addition to saving some battery juice, the phone will save you from some eyestrain too. There is also a Bluelight filter option, which further prevents your eyes from the dark effect of blue light.  For the people with the kids, Samsung has also included a dedicated kid mode. Turning on this mode lets you use only a few limited apps. So even if your kids accidentally press some buttons on the phone, you won’t have to worry a bit. I don’t have kids in my home but those who do, it might come in really handy.   Continuing with the software, let’s talk about the bloatware now. Unlike most of the custom skins out there, the one on the A70 comes with just a few bloatware. And since most of them can be uninstalled quite easily, I have nothing to complain here. But I am not quite satisfied with one thing though.  I have already complained about it in a number of Samsung phones and I will complain on this one too. Yes, it’s about the Icons. The Icons on this device looks cartoonish. And with the cartoonish UI, the smartphone looks like a cheap knockoff. So I hope Samsung will release an update and fix those icons.  Camera  Let’s talk about the camera now. The phone comes with a triple camera setup at the back. Among which the primary one gets a 32MP sensor. There is also an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens and a 5MP depth sensor, which promises a fair bit of versatility.   Images from the main camera look decent. The colors look close to natural so the images are usually pleasing to the eyes. However, the images don’t look particularly sharp when it comes to the details. Despite having a 32MP sensor, the phone captures 12MP images by default. So I thought that was the reason for the reduced sharpness. But even when I took full-res 32MP images, I did not find much of a difference in terms of images quality. The phone also quite suffers when it comes to the dynamic range. Most of the times, the device fails to preserve the shadow details.        1  of 11                                                                                                                                Talking about the ultra-wide-angle camera, it does a decent job. When I reviewed the Galaxy A50, there was a color-shifting issue while capturing images from the primary camera and ultra-wide-angle camera. But that’s no longer a case here. The colors look good here and it generously stretches the field of view. So I have nothing to complain about here.      Normal Vs Wide-angle mode   1  of 12               Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode                                                When it comes to the portrait images, it has quite got better when compared to the A50. But still, it’s not perfect. The phone still struggles to detect the edges properly. So even the artifacts of the subject are blurred most of the times. And it’s more pronounced in the hair part. While looking at the smartphone screen, you may not be able to notice it. But if you zoom in slightly, you can easily find it. I hope it will get better with the software updates.        1  of 5                                                                    Nonetheless, the portrait mode on the device is really playful, I really enjoyed taking some artistic portrait images. Apart from adjusting the amount of blurs into the images, you can also give a different perspective to the background. There are Spin, Zoom and Color Point effects, which makes the portrait images look quite cool.      Images in low light   1  of 6               Night Mode Normal         Night Mode Wide-angle         Night Mode Normal         Night Mode Wide-angle         Night Mode Normal         Night Mode Wide-angle                              Low light images are not particularly great either. Colors look faded in the low light and noises and grains are also quite evident. But since the phone supports Gcam, you can use the Gcam’s Night Sight feature to enhance the colors and to subdue the noises.      Gcam's Normal Mode vs Night Sight Mode   1  of 6               Gcam Normal         Gcam Night Sight         Gcam Normal         Gcam Night Sight         Gcam Normal         Gcam Night Sight                              Selfies look good on the A70. The phone quite preserves the skin tone so the normal selfies look natural. But on switching to the portrait mode, the phone slightly smoothens the skin and whitens them. And talking about the background blurring, it is also not the perfect one. It also fails to detect the edges properly through the images look decent most of the times. However, taking portrait group selfie is kinda tricky here. The phone focuses on one face and blurs all the other faces, which could really be annoying. Although there is not an extra wide-angle lens on the front, there is a wide-angle selfie. It slightly extends the field of view. Although I didn’t find it particularly useful, it might come in handy if you are with a group of friends.        1  of 10               Normal Selfie         Normal Selfie         Wide-angle Selfie         Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Normal Group Selfie         Portrait Group Selfie         Portrait Group Selfie                                          Also, there’s Slow Motion and Super Slo-Mo features. With these features, you can record abrupt moments up to 480fps at 720P resolution. But what’s not acceptable here is its normal videos doesn’t have any kind of stabilization, not even EIS. The Color reproduction and focusing are good, though.  So, to sum up, the camera, it’s not a great camera, it’s slightly better than the much cheaper Galaxy A50, but it will do for the most part.  For high res images,  Click here .  Audio   Now let’s talk about the audio. Since the device is targeted at the multimedia enthusiasts, I was quite expecting a stereo speaker setup but that’s not the case here. The device comes with a single bottom-firing speaker, which is just an average performer. Loudness is on par with most of the midrange devices out there. And it often tends to get distorted while playing audio in loud volumes. Even when it comes to the audio quality, there is nothing extraordinary here. So there is nothing to be excited here.  However, there is a treat for the people, who love listening to music via headphones. The phone comes with Dolby Atmos support, which can be turned on only if the headphones are connected to the phone. With the Dolby Atmos turned on, I noticed quite a boost in the audio volume. In addition, there was also a better separation between the left and the right channels. You can also quite notice the depth in the music. So if you are an audiophile, the phone won’t disappoint when listening to music via headphones. Samsung has also included a pair of headphone on the box but they are not quite impressive. Though, it does a fine job while making some voice calls.  Security  On the security side, the phone gets a fingerprint scanner and the Face Unlock feature as the biometric means of unlocking the device. The fingerprint scanner on this device rests underneath the display. So with the under-display fingerprint scanner on the board, the A70 looks fancy. But it’s not quite on the level of flagship S10 devices. The phone uses an optical scanner contrary to the ultrasonic one on the  Galaxy S10 .  Although it’s good to see such type of technology in the midrange devices like the A70, the tech is not quite polished on this one. Previously, the fingerprint scanner took more than 1 second to unlock the device. The scanner also had a bad record of recognizing the fingerprint. And it was absolutely frustrating. But recently, I received the May security update, which came with enhancements on the fingerprint scanner. The scanner is slightly faster now. But still not quite on the level of Vivo V15 Pro. The  Vivo V15 Pro  uses the same technology but is very quick to unlock the device. The fingerprint scanner on the V15 Pro unlocks the device in just 0.37 seconds, which is a lot faster than the A70.   I noticed that the device is quick to unlock the device when the screen is on. So if you are bothered by its slow speed, you can use that trick as well. And as I have been regularly receiving updates, I hope Samsung will software updates to enhance the unlocking speed even further.  There is also a Face Unlock feature in this phone. The Face Unlock feature uses just the front camera to register and authenticate the face. So it’s not quite accurate. The unlocking speed of this feature is not that fast as well, especially if you compare it with the smartphones like  Oppo F11 Pro  and Vivo V15 pro. But since it’s faster than the Fingerprint, I find myself using it more often.  Battery  Now let’s head on to the battery part. In its slim form factor, Samsung has surprisingly packed a massive 4500mAh battery. As you can expect from smartphones with a big battery, it provides prolonged endurance. On the normal use, a fully charged A70 can easily provide two days of backup. You can even extend the battery life by turning the Power Saving Mode and Ultra Power Saving Mode options.   Despite having a huge battery, charging the device is still hassle-free. The phone comes with a 25-watt charger in the box, which helps to refill the battery really fast. And it’s quite surprising that Samsung has included a 25-watt fast charger on the box of A70 whereas the flagship S10 devices still come with 15-watt chargers. Taking about the charging time, you can get your device fully refilled in around 1 and half hours using the 25-watt stock charger.  Conclusion  The Galaxy A70 is really a device for multimedia enthusiasts. With a big vibrant display and a big battery, it is quite an ideal phone for multimedia consumption at this price range. With the clean UI and the capable processor on the board, the device is also swift and smooth. And the camera is also on par with the competition, if not the best.  Although the under-display fingerprint scanner has improved in terms of speed and accuracy with the recent update, it’s still not as good as its competitors. So if you want a slightly better camera and faster fingerprint scanner,  Vivo V15 Pro  (Rs. 50,390) might please you. But note that, the UI on the V15 Pro is not everyone’s cup of tea. Other than the fingerprint scanner and camera, the A70 is on par or better than the Vivo V15 Pro in almost every aspect.  Samsung Galaxy A70 Pros and Cons  Pros:   Big and vibrant display  Capable processor on the board and fast memory  Big battery with fast charging support  Clean and smooth UI   Cons:   Slow fingerprint scanner  Cameras not up to the mark""]",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/samsung-galaxy-a70-review.jpg']
['Scientists developed a wearable band that can keep your body at a perfect temperature'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 19, 2019']",2019-05-19 14:02:30+00:00,"['It’s quite hard to cope with the freezing cool in the winter and scorching sun in the summer. And some of us might have even struggled with colleagues and siblings to maintain the temperature of AC, fan, and heaters according to our liking. But running the AC, fan, coolers, and heaters to obtain comfortable working temperatures is also creating quite a loss of energy loss. Such type of heating/cooling system heats/cools the entire room to make the people inside it comfortable, which is not by far an efficient means. More than 10% of the global energy consumption goes on heating and cooling the buildings. So as a means to develop an efficient means of maintaining an individual’s body temperature within comfortable limits, researchers created an Armband, a wearable band which can keep your body at a perfect temperature.  The armband works as a personal heater/cooler that heats or cools the body temperature so as to maintain a comfortable temperature of the body. The patch of the armband can lower the body temperature up to 10-degree Celsius (or 50-degree Fahrenheit). With the capability to maintain a constant temperature during various circumstances, scientists claim it to be an efficient and simpler solution to the central heating/cooling system.         Thermoelectric alloys are equipped in the arm patch. These materials use electricity to create a temperature difference. Researchers have built this kind of patch by soldering small pillars of the thermoelectric alloys into the thin sheets of copper electrodes. These are then assembled into two stretchy elastomer sheets. A battery has been included in the system to inject the power. The electric current from the battery flows across the pillars of the armband, which drives heat from one sheet to another. When the heat goes to the sheet closest to the user’s skin, it raises the body temperature. If it is transferred to the sheet furthest away, warmth is removed from their skin and they cool down. In a test performed on a person, the patch was successfully able to maintain the body temperature at 32-degree Celsius when the background temperature was varied from 22-degrees to 36-degrees.   The armband uses a 5cm patch, which happens to be flexible and lightweight. They are said not to cause any sort of discomfort on the use. Researchers further say a patch uses 26 watts of power to cool the body temperature in a hot day. However, the scientists also said that around 100 of such patches will be required to cool an individual in extremely hot days. And for that, it will require a vest to cover the cover and cool the parts of the body like back and neck, which are susceptible to overheating. However, this would cause hundreds of pounds to manufacture a single unit. And this surely won’t be affordable to most of the population. So the scientists are now more focused on the ways to develop the product, which could cut some manufacturing costs.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/armband-to-control-body-temperature.jpg']

And this time because of the recent hardware thing they developed. Dubbed as ‘Car Thing’, the device is an audio device for the cars, which can be controlled via voice commands.  The number of smart voice assistants is burgeoning. Because of their AI-packed capabilities and their voice commands recognizing prowess, they have somewhat made our tasks hassle-free. Since most of the smart voice assistants are also integrated with the Spotify, there seems barely any use of the Car Thing. And the company has also explicitly mentioned that this device won’t make a debut commercially. The music platform also clearly implied that they have no intentions of bringing hardware devices. The company says that Spotify will primarily focus on being the top music platform.  But why is the company spending so much of fund into a product that won’t release commercially? Well, the Spotify is trying to learn the music listening habits of people while they are driving. And to study the behavior, the company will be giving the device for some of its premium users for free.        How does Car Thing work?  The device plugs into the car’s 12-volt outlet for the power. It does not have its own data connection so it requires Bluetooth to connect with the user’s smartphone to access the music library. The device also pairs with the audio system inside the car. So if the users want to listen to the music using the audio setup inside the car, the Car Thing will allow that too.  Like most of the voice assistants, the Car Thing is easy to use. It can be triggered with the voice command “Hey, Spotify”. And according to the users’ needs and desire, they can play any specific music, skip it or pause it.  In terms of design, the device comes with a tiny remote. But unlike a remote, it comes with a circular screen at a side, which shows the music or audio track being played. Alongside the display, there are also four buttons, which can be used to access playlist presets.  The test is supposed to start within the next few weeks. Spotify has mentioned that the test will only run in the US as of now. Although there is not a specific timeline about the test period, the test is said to be small and may not take place for a long duration. Apart from the Car Thing, Spotify has also trademarked Home Thing and Voice Thing. Since the company has already explicitly explained that it has no plans to release hardware devices commercially, we are still unsure how the company will use these test devices in the future.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/spotify-car-thing.jpg']

This year, there has been quite an expansion in Oppo’s A-series lineup too. Till the date, we have already seen the devices like  Oppo A1k ,  A5s ,  A7n , and  A9 . And this time, the company has added a new handset, Oppo A9x in their portfolio.  Overview:  In terms of specs, it looks vaguely familiar with the Oppo A9, which was launched last month. The smartphone comes with a  6.53-inch display  with a  water-drop notch  on the top. The display on this device comes with a  90.7% screen to body ratio  and features  Full-HD+ resolution  to ensure sharp contents.

On the storage front, the Oppo A9x flaunts  128GB of onboard memory , which can be expanded up to 256GB via micro SD card. Understanding the burgeoning gaming craze, Oppo has also included a  Game Boost 2.0 feature  to enhance the performance during gaming sessions.         In the imaging part though, the A9x has received a fancy upgrade over the A9. The rear camera on this device comes aboard with a  48MP main camera , which comes paired with a  5MP depth sensor . And a  16MP selfie shooter  dwells on the notch up top.  Like most of the recent Oppo phones, this one too also gets a sizable battery. With a humongous  4020mAh battery , the phone promises a prolonged endurance.

And Oppo – the company that gave us the slider cameras with the  Oppo Find X , decided that it was too much work. So, they opted for a pop-up selfie camera just like everyone else. And here’s the phone which did that – the F11 Pro. But other than the selfie camera, what are the striking features of the phone? Let’s find that out in this Oppo F11 Pro review.   Oppo F11 Pro Specifications   Display : 6.53-inch LTPS IPS LCD Full HD+ display, 19.5:9 aspect ratio  CPU : Octa-core MediaTek Helio P70  PU : Mali-G72 MP3  OS : Android 9 Pie with ColorOS 6 on top  RAM : 6GB  Storage : 128GB, Expandable up to 256GB via SD card  Rear Camera : Dual: (48MP, f/1.8,\xa01/2″, 0.8µm, PDAF) + (5MP, f/2.4, 1/5”, 1.12µm), LED flash  Front Camera : 16MP, f/2.0; Motorized Pop-up camera  Sensors : Fingerprint (Rear-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, Compass  Battery : 4,000 mAh with VOOC 3.0 Flash Charging technology; Micro USB charging port  Price : Rs. 47,990 (Regular version) | Rs. 49,990 (Marvel Avengers Edition)   Design and Build  On the design front, Oppo has done it again – fooled me into thinking that it was a glass back, even though it’s plastic. Maybe it’s the color scheme, that looks different even though it follows a triple-gradient color pattern. This, here, is the Thunder Black, which comes in a pretty unique color pattern – a blue, black purple blend. And this does look stunning. I liked it, but if I had my way, I’d definitely go for the  Marvel Avengers edition , which is a tad bit expensive.         The rest of the design is pretty standard, though. A rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, volume rockers on the left and a power button on the right. There’s a headphone jack and a micro USB port. I disdain the micro USB port, but I don’t get it why the companies like Vivo and Oppo are still on it.        1  of 3               Ports         Buttons         Sim Card Tray                      Build quality is pretty standard for a plastic phone. It’s got some heft, and an okay feel in the hands. The plus side, here, is the pop-up camera comes with a Fall Protection – if it’s out, it just slides back in case you drop it!  Camera  The design is one of the phone’s strongest suits. But here’s something it missed out – cameras. The F11 Pro packs a whopping 48 MP primary camera and a secondary 5 MP depth sensor. But while every other mid-ranger these days are packing an ultra-wide angle sensor, this one doesn’t. And, for a company that prides itself in having one of the best cameras around, they missed out on that. Is it deliberate? I don’t know. But I just think that they should have made some kind of upgrade from the  Oppo F9 . After all, the F9 had the same camera configuration.   Still, I had quite a bit of expectation from the camera. Too bad, I was somewhat let down. Don’t get me wrong – the camera is not that bad, it’s just my expectations, because when we did a camera comparison between the  Oppo F9 ,  Nova 3i , and the  Vivo V11 , last year, Oppo was the clear winner. But now, I doubt the F11 would perform the same way.   Some images come out good enough in well-lit conditions. But for others, the dynamic range is not very good. Many photos come out over-processed, and for some reason, it kind of messes with the intensity of blacks. That is not really noticeable, though, only when you compare it with other phones, for instance, the  Vivo V15 Pro . Bright colors like greens and reds can come out a bit too over-blown.        1  of 9                                                                                                            However, close up shots in well-lit environments can be great. Similar is the case with portrait shots. The colors are good, details are there, and the edge detection is better than what you regularly see on phones of this caliber. The blurs and subject focus on the bokeh is on point, and so, the portrait images are better than your regular images.        1  of 5                                                                    There is, however, a dedicated Night Mode. And just like any other, this is a long exposure shot of about 5 seconds. The colors it produces are a bit too smooth, but it kinda lacks some details and texture. But of course, that is to be expected of a Night Mode in a camera.      Normal Vs Night Mode   1  of 6                                                                              As for the pop selfie camera, it is a 16 MP unit. And the selfies are a lot better than the normal photos.   Selfie images pack good details, good colors and the dynamic range is balanced too. Portrait selfies, even though they’re purely software is pretty good too. My only complaint is that it cannot recognize multiple faces in a portrait selfie.        1  of 5               Portrait Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Normal Selfie         Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie                           As for videos, it can record Full HD videos at 30 frames per second – not even 60. And this is something that is available in other more affordable devices as well. So, nothing impressive here. Also, the video quality is not something I’d like to go on about – the details are about average, colors are the same…sometimes, even unnatural. The low light video quality is even worse. However, there is Electronic Image Stabilization, so, this is your better-than-average video camera, to be blunt.  For high res images,  Click here .  Display  With the pop-up selfie camera, the display here is notch-less and bezel-less. There is a small chin at the bottom, but nothing I can’t live with. And as it is with these full-screen displays, it was fun to use. You get a lot of room to work with, for almost anything – watching videos to playing games, or just casual browsing.   The display is big, too. A 6.5 inch IPS LCD display with a 19:9 aspect ratio greets you and I’ve loved the sheer size of it. There’s just so much room. And with 90% of screen to body ratio, the phone does not feel so big in the hands. The screen has some good colors, great viewing angles, and ample brightness. The pixel density, is great too, but what I will say, though, is the competitors, in similar price range, offer AMOLED or at least OLED displays. This doesn’t and so…it feels like a letdown.  Performance  Now, let’s talk about performance. And here’s a bit of a downer. This because it still packs  MediaTek Helio P70 processor , which can be compared to the Snapdragon 660. But the competitors like the Galaxy A70 is packing a Snapdragon 675. And that kinda bothers me.  Go by the benchmark scores, and you’ll find other phones with better benchmarks out there. Of course, the scores are not the whole story. Regular performance is snappy. Apps open and load fast, and you can also do multitasking with a lot of apps in the background. Gaming is also pretty breezy. It will handle all kinds of games unless you want to play PUBG in the highest settings, it’ll do for the most part.  It’s just that for the price, there are other options out there. So, for me, the performance is a mixed bag.  Software & UI  And making it more of a mixed bag is Oppo’s not-so-good UI. Oppo’s phones are not known for their UIs, they’re mostly horrible, but this time it’s a bit different. Based on Android Pie with Color OS 6.0, the user experience has improved quite a bit.   There are small improvements like an app drawer option, and it also allows you to access the Developer mode without the constant reminder that you’re on Developer mode and you need to turn it off. To say the least, the UI, although bad, is not an eyesore this time around.  Battery  Also, the battery is the phone’s strong suit. With a 4000 mAh battery, you can get 2 days of battery life easily with normal usage. And even under extreme usage, you can end up with about 25 to 30% battery left at the end of the day.   What’s more impressive is the charging times – the VOOC Charge 3.0 does a great job when it comes to charging. The phone charges from like 2% to 90% in under an hour. The only thing is, I’d have liked to see a USB-C port.  Extras  So…what did I miss? Ummm…the speaker quality is good. It’s a mono speaker, but it sounds good actually. It gets 128 GB of storage, which is good. But in case you need a micro SD card, you have to sacrifice your second SIM. Also, the fingerprint sensor is quite fast. Given that it is a traditional physical sensor; it works as expected. The Face Unlock with the pop-up camera is fast, too, and apart from pitch black conditions, it works almost all the time.  Conclusion  As it stands, the Oppo F11 Pro is a good phone, with respectable performance, a good display, okay cameras, great battery, and some great design choices. For a standalone device, it is a good phone, no doubt. But when you start comparing it with others, that’s when things don’t look so good. It’s rivals, in the same price category, offer many other traits – like AMOLED displays, better processors, in-display fingerprint scanners and one that I miss the most – an Ultra-wide angle lens.  So, this is something that you won’t go wrong with. It’s just that it kinda fails to transition from the traditional to the modern trend in some ways.  Pros and Cons  Pros:   Good design  Full View display  Fast charging battery   Cons:   No AMOLED display  Micro USB in 2019  No ultra-wide angle lens']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/oppo-f11-pro-review.jpg']

But it didn’t show up…at all. Even when two other new phones showed up, the Xperia 10 and the Xperia 10 Plus, this phone didn’t see the light of day. That is, until now. A very similar device dubbed the  Sony Xperia Ace  is now available in Japan.  Sony Xperia Ace Overview  The Sony Xperia Ace, as Sony promised, is a compact phone. Well, compact in the sense that it still has a small footprint and decent hardware. But of course, this looks nothing like a 2019 phone…or even 2018 for that matter.         Because, what you get is a  small 5″ screen , with the huge bezels, top, and bottom. The display is  Full HD resolution  with  18:9 aspect ratio . But the large bezels house Sony’s dual speakers, which are well-known in the smartphone world. However, the Sony Xperia Ace features single cameras, both front, and back. The rear camera is a  12 MP sensor  whereas the  front is an 8 MP  one. So, I guess cameras are not a strong suit.  Internally, it runs on the  Snapdragon 630  alongside  4 GB RAM  and  64 GB storage . The storage is expandable via microSD card. However, the battery is pretty flimsy at  2700 mAh  and there’s no word on Fast Charging. But despite its 2016 – 2017 looks, it has NFC, USB-C, and  water-and-dust resistance  as well. In addition, there’s a fingerprint sensor on the right side.  Pricing and Availability  The phone is not available anywhere else, except for Japan. And that, too, is courtesy of the company’s network Docomo. But even if it was available, I doubt it would be anyone’s favorite at a  price tag of JPY 48,600,  which is equivalent to  over $440 . Because, well, there are better devices, for cheaper. For instance, the  Google Pixel 3A.  Maybe, it would be more affordable if it was launched globally. But that, is only a guess, after all.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sony-xperia-ace-1.jpg']

But their smartphones don’t get enough recognition, probably because of their poor software. And maybe, most of them fail to stand out in any way. But that’s all in the past. Because with the  ASUS Zenfone 6 , it actually teaches the big players how to rock an all-screen display!  ASUS Zenfone 6 Overview  Upon first look, the ASUS Zenfone looks like any other flagship of today – a  glass body  with a rear-mounted fingerprint screen and a big screen with that edge-to-edge display. There is no selfie camera on the front. You must have guessed it, but the way it achieves it is very interesting. This ain’t your regular pop-up camera…it’s more like a “ Flip Camera “. This means, that its  rear camera module flips out to double as the selfie camera!         This concept is not new, though. The  Samsung Galaxy A80  introduced this, but it was a slider and a rotating mechanism. This, however, looks much cleaner. In addition, the flip camera has got quite a few tricks up its sleeve! First, the camera setup is a  48 MP primary  and a  13 MP ultra-wide setup . Getting to use the same for your selfies is great enough, but you can also control the angles of the camera. Meaning, you can use it to take  panoramic shots without moving  and some weird-angled selfies, if you so fancy. Furthermore, you can also take  4K videos at 60 fps , which not all flagships can give you.   The rest of the phone seems pretty standard. It checks all the boxes for a flagship. There’s  Snapdragon 855 processor , with  up to 8 GB RAM , and  up to 256 GB storage . Plus, there’s expandable memory in the form of a triple-slot, which allows you to store dual SIMs and a microSD card. Also, it packs a  mammoth 5000 mAh battery  and has 1 8-Watt Fast Charging . That’s not the fastest, especially, for a battery that size…but it’s good enough. Software-wise, it runs on  Zen UI 6 . And while Zen UI wasn’t received well, this iteration is one of the closest to Stock Android experiences you’ll get.  And all of this is at the starting  price of €499 , for the base model…which starts at 6 GB RAM configuration, and 64 GB storage. That’s just a bit higher than the  Xiaomi Mi 9  but considerably less than other flagships. For all that it packs, it’s certainly a very interesting combo, to say the least.  ASUS Zenfone 6 Specifications:   Design : Glass body, aluminum frame, Flip-camera module, rear-mounted fingerprint sensor  Display : 6.4″ IPS LCD all-screen display with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2340 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio, Gorilla Glass 6 protection  Rear Camera : Dual, 48 MP primary with f/1.8 aperture, PDAF, EIS, Auto-panorama + 13 MP Ultra-wide with f/2.4 aperture  Front Camera : Motorized Flip Rear camera module  Processor : Qualcomm Snapdragon 855  CPU : Octa-core (1×2.84 GHz Kryo 485 & 3×2.41 GHz Kryo 485 & 4×1.78 GHz Kryo 485)  GPU : Adreno 640  RAM : 6 GB / 8 GB  Storage : 64 / 128 / 256 GB, expandable via microSD  OS : Zenfone UI 6  Battery : 5000 mAh with 18-Watt Fast Charging (Quick-Charge 4.0)']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/asus-zenfone-6-launched.jpg']

And so, another cashback offer, or simply, discounts on phones are upon us. They’re offering discounts on three of their products, and some of them, are indeed heavy discounts!  Samsung Galaxy A7 (2018)  The first discount is on the  Samsung Galaxy A7 (2018) . And this phone is something I had high expectations with, back when it was launched. Yet, it didn’t really deliver. And at 2019, I doubt it’ll be able to do so. Because, well there are other phones, even from Samsung themselves, that are better.         After a New Year’s discount on the same phone, it was available for Rs.33,990. And with this latest  cashback of Rs.3000 , the phone is available for  Rs.30,990 . Just after a few months of the offer, for another offer to come up should make it obvious that there are other better phones out there. I’d rather get the  Galaxy A50 , even for a slightly higher price!  Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018)  Here’s another phone that promised a lot of fancy stuff when it came with 4 cameras. And back in 2018, 4 cameras were a big deal! And yet, the  Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018)  failed spectacularly in our review. Its 4 cameras proved to be nothing but gimmicky features.   Well, after the negative reaction on the cameras, we had hints that after software updates, the camera has improved a lot. But still, a cashback/discount of Rs.10,000 kinda means the phone is not really selling. I wonder why… Anyways, the phone,  initially costing Rs.53,990 is not up for grabs at Rs.43,990 . This large discount only proving that this phone is not that good. Because for a little more, you can get the  Galaxy A70  itself, or the  Oppo F11 Pro !  Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5  Tablets are, well, already growing less and less popular. Despite that, Samsung launched the  Galaxy Tab A 10.5  last year, for quite a heavy price. For all that it packed, the price seemed too high, both internationally, and here, in Nepal as well. Because who’d pay around Rs.55000 for something with a plastic body and  Snapdragon 450 processor ?   And I guess, that’s the reason it didn’t really sell well. And here, it is now, after a  discount of Rs.12000!  That makes its  new price Rs.42,490 ! And yes, the amount of discount and the new price makes it appear tempting. But remember, this one is more like a flop product, and also last year’s…plus not something you can call powerful.  Samsung Super Summer Offer only seems to be providing discounts on those products that didn’t sell well. And even though these discounts are large, there are a lot of other better phones out there to buy!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/samsung-super-summer-offer.jpg']

And the new  Apple Watch Series 4  has just landed in Nepal.  Apple Watch Series 4 Overview  The Apple Watch Series 4 sees quite a bit of improvement over the Apple Watch Series 3. For starters, the design and build quality are also a lot better as it’s got a  ceramic and sapphire back  that helps in better conduction of radio waves, which makes for better connectivity. Also, it features a  30% bigger display  than the previous generation at 1.78″. The  LTPO OLED Retina TouchScreen display  also supports 3D Touch functionality, and brightness can go up to a 1000 nits!

The most notable features in this one are Wireless charging, bigger battery and hands-free “Hey Siri” support.  Apple AirPods 2 Overview  At first look, you might not be able to differentiate between the previous generation and this generation’s AirPods. The design is uncannily similar, except for a small  LED indicators  on the outside that denote battery life.         The functions and internals carry most of the difference. With  Bluetooth 5.0  this time around, wireless connectivity has improved by a lot. Also, what helps for a more stable and better wireless connection is the new  HI Headphone chip . According to Apple’s claims, the performance on this one is 2X faster, i.e. while switching between active devices. The chip is, supposedly, also responsible for better battery backup. Since there’s no specification for battery (classic Apple), we’ll have to make do with their info that it gives  5 hours of music playback  and 3 hours of talk time.  Nonetheless, this time, they come with a Wireless Charging Case as well. Wireless Charging is Qi standard and will work with any Qi-supported chargers. Plus, there’s quick charging in it, so, with 15 minutes of charging, it’ll last you for 3 hours.  New features include  hands-free “Hey Siri” support . Which means you don’t have to tap on the earphones to launch Siri, but just say so and it’ll launch. Dual beaming microphones make for better call quality, but just like before, there is no noise cancellation of any sort.  Pricing and Availability  The Apple AirPods 2 come in two variations – one with a Wireless Charging case, and the other without. And there’s actually quite a bit of difference in their prices.

Of course, I wouldn’t call that display small, but still, that aspect ratio, while being wide, is not very useful is it? Contents are barely getting used to that 18:9 aspect ratio.         Anyways, another notable thing about this phone is its selfie camera. It chose to employ a punch-hole style camera seen on the likes of  Galaxy S10 ,  Galaxy S10e  and  Nova 4 . And it packs a nice  25 MP camera  on the punch-hole. As for the rear camera, it packs a standard  dual camera setup . That setup compromises of a 48 MP primary lens and a 5 MP depth sensor. Also, that 48 MP sensor uses  pixel binning  to take 12 MP photos. However, there’s some AI magic in the camera for shot optimizations and a Night Mode.

And it is exploring the potential  use of hydrogen fuel cells  as an environment-friendly power source for aircraft. If successful, this can lead to all-electric airliners with zero greenhouse gas emissions!  This development program is under the code name  CHEETA . And that stands for  Center for Cryogenic High-Efficiency Electrical Technologies for Aircraft . This program focuses on developing a fully electric aircraft platform which uses cryogenic liquid hydrogen as an energy source. Doing so, instead of hydrogen gas can generate clean power without using heavy pressurized storage tanks.        Also, that solves the weight problems in aircraft. And at the same time, it can bring feasible hydrogen power to large aircraft for the first time. And this…might be able to revolutionize the aviation industry.  How does it work?  Source:  University of Illinois College of Engineering  The aircraft is electrically powered. But the electrical power itself comes from Hydrogen fuel cells.  Hydrogen chemical energy is converted into electrical energy  through a series of fuel cells. And this drives the  ultra-efficient electric propulsion system . Hydrogen fuel cells are in use in cars and trains. But enough heavy pressurized tanks that store the hydrogen gas means quite a bit of weight. And that is a bane for large aircraft.  But by using liquid hydrogen, CHEETA claims it will solve the problem. At the same time, the low temperatures needed to run the liquid hydrogen fuel power supply allows for the use of high-efficiency superconducting energy transmission technology and high-powered motor systems.  It works in the same principle of MRI machines in hospitals. They use liquid helium to cool the machine’s magnets until they gain superconducting properties that generate high-intensity magnetic fields.  The only problem, right now is that there are no technologies needed to connect such power sources to electrically-driven propulsion technologies and apply them within a large aircraft. But the CHEETA project aims to bridge this gap to create fully electric airlines in the future.  Present Scenario  Many recent advances in non-cryogenic machines and drives are bringing electric propulsion of commercial jets closer to reality. But practical cryogenic systems remain still remain a benchmark for large aircraft. Now, there occurred a lot of improvements and advances in aircraft engine and design. That has made aircraft more efficient than before.  But still, they run largely on fossil fuels. And due to that, air travel remains the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, relying on fossil fuels also means large operating costs for airliners. So, to minimize both expenses and the impact on the environment, this needs to work.  The CHEETA team is pretty confident about this. But since this will take over 3 years to fully develop, only time will tell.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/electric-aircraft.jpg']
['Intel reveals flaw in its chips making it vulnerable to ZombieLoad attacks!'],"['Processors', 'Intel']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 15, 2019']",2019-05-15 11:23:49+00:00,"['This might come as an alarm…or not, depending on how paranoid you are. Intel has had a grave flaw in its chip architecture from as long as 2011. This security flaw allows  hackers to steal any data  that’s recently passed through the processor. And this can also affect cloud servers which can allow attackers to steal information from other virtual machines running on the same computer.  This flaw makes your computers vulnerable to three kinds of attacks:  RIDL, Fallout , and  ZombieLoad . The first two are not as concerning, but ZombieLoad is the most critical of them. It works by  exploiting the design flaw of Intel chips  to leak sensitive user data. The vulnerabilities are termed as  MDS (Microarchitectural Data Sampling) . And MDS, under certain circumstances, can provide a program the means to read user data, which is not usually accessible. But this is a very complex process, and MDS itself is no threat. It only becomes one if hackers can figure this out and use it. Nevertheless, the fact that attackers can use it is a concern.         How does ZombieLoad work?  It works by exploiting a process called  Speculative Execution . In it, processors predict what data or process will an application need in the future. And hackers can access the buffers in the processor’s components through malicious code. Having to design a malicious code to do so requires quite a bit of work. But apparently,  it’s easy to bypass the security mechanisms in the Speculative Execution system of the chip and funnel the data being transmitted like passwords, keys, accounts, tokens , etc.   In technical terms, “zombie load” means the kind of data that the processor can’t understand properly or process. So, it asks help from the processor’s micro-code to prevent a crash. Applications are usually only able to see their own data. But, this design flaw allows the data to run through the apps’ boundaries. So, ZombieLoad will leak any data currently under process. I.E. if anyone decides to look for it, in this case, hackers.  Of course, it’s not always that users enter passwords and such in their computers. And since hackers have no way of knowing that, an attack has very less chance of returning any worthy data. But programs can be designed to do tasks repeatedly. And if they can execute it in such a way, hackers can gain some data of worth out of a number of attacks.  How to Solve it?  This is, apparently, a flaw in Intel’s processor design itself, and it goes back to 2011. So, if your computer came from after 2011 to any recent years, you are vulnerable. However,  AMD and ARM Holding’s chips and computers are not vulnerable  from this particular flaw.  A team of  researchers from Graz University of Technology  found this out and disclosed it to Intel. They also designed an  online tool  to check if you have been attacked. But this is very complex and needs a computer geek to successfully run it! Intel has, since then, issued a warning and a patch tool to fix these issues. But first, manufacturers have to implement the tool in their systems and then users have to install them to be safe.  Intel is already rolling out updates to operating systems  and hypervisor software to fix it. Also, Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all released patches to fix these issues for now. In addition, Microsoft will be releasing more fixes through future software updates. So, if you receive software updates, you should download it this time. Furthermore, Intel said it will release future processor with necessary hardware changes to fix the issue as well.  Still, there is no data on any attacks as a result of this vulnerability. Maybe, no one really knew about it before this. But since it is information now, there are chances of hackers exploiting this.  If you’re someone who carries out a lot of transactions on their computer or handles classified information, you should probably update . As for the normal layman, there may not be a reason to worry about much.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Intel-9th-Gen-Processors.jpg']

The company has strived in providing devices with good value for the price. The phones from Realme pack quite a lot of features for a cheap price. Continuing with that trend, Realme has just launched the Realme X which can give even some of the flagship phones a run for their money if its specifications are concerned. However, the phone is not launching in Nepal.  Realme X Overview  The Realme X continues the trend of phones featuring tall displays with a 6.53-inch Full HD+ display that has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. This screen is an AMOLED panel which is an amazing addition for the price the phone comes with.  Under the hood, the Realme X is powered by the 10nm octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 processor. The company has unveiled three RAM variants of the device – 4 GB, 6 GB, and 8 GB. The 4 GB and 6 GB variants have 64 GB of internal memory while the 8 GB version comes with 128 GB of storage.         In terms of the optics, the Realme X has dual cameras on the rear. There is a 48-megapixel primary lens accompanied by a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The 48-megapixel camera has the same Sony IMX586 sensor the new  OnePlus 7 Pro  comes with which is quite surprising for the fact that the 7 Pro costs $669 in the USA.

['Seven Things You Might Not Know About The OnePlus 7 Pro'],"['OnePlus', 'Opinion']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['May 15, 2019']",2019-05-15 08:17:36+00:00,"['OnePlus unveiled the  OnePlus 7 Pro  yesterday. It’s a device that doesn’t look and feel like a phone from OnePlus, but it is something that really looks like value for money. You’ve probably come across a lot of reviews on the device but you might have missed a couple of little and big things about the phone. While OnePlus talked about its new device in detail at the event itself, there might have been a few things you have missed. So, let’s talk about that here.  Camera Sensor  The OnePlus 7 Pro is the first OnePlus smartphone to house triple rear cameras. There’s a primary, a wide-angle and a telephoto lens on the setup. This primary camera measures 48-megapixel. I mean wow! This has to better than the 40MP one on the P30 Pro right? Well, not really. This lens on the OnePlus flagship has the Sony IMX586 sensor, and if it sounds all too familiar, it’s because this is the same sensor the  Redmi Note 7 Pro , a phone that’s dirt cheap in front of the OnePlus 7 Pro, has. Other devices such as the (to-be-launched)  Realme X  and even the  UMIDIGI S3 Pro  also pack the same sensor. This primary lens on the 7 Pro does the same  pixel binning  resulting in a 12-megapixel image.         The real-life scenario could be slightly different with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855’s processing power, but if you go for the specs, it’s not all too good for the new ‘flagship killer’.  Display  One of the most eye-catching features of the new device is the display. It’s quite tall, and like the flagships from Samsung and Huawei, the display ends on curves on the sides. This is why the phone is not like any previous OnePlus device.   This display has Quad-HD resolution, but the main talking point here is the 90Hz refresh rate. With this feature, the smoothness of loading up images and videos, and also scrolling comes second to none. The users will definitely love this feature, and other smartphone manufacturers will certainly take note for their future phones.  Pop-up camera  To remove the bezels and notches on the display, OnePlus has taken the route of Oppo and Vivo. The company has included a pop-up camera on the top of the phone.   Now, this has certainly brought in criticism from the purists, but there are a couple of positives. For starters, this camera takes only half a second to show up which is quite faster than other devices. And OnePlus has claimed that this pop-up camera can lift nearly 50 pounds of weight. So, yeah, even with the mechanical part, this phone looks quite sturdy. However, the 300,000 opening and the Free Fall Detection feature OnePlus bragged about is what  Oppo  and  Vivo  have already done implemented on their phones.  UFS 3.0  While taking a look at a smartphone, we don’t really go into depth regarding the storage driver it holds. Even with a huge amount of memory, phones can be slower at times. However, that’s not the case with the OnePlus 7 Pro as it has UFS 3.0 storage inside. Universal Flash Storage or UFS is a storage driver meant for phones, cameras, and other digital devices. And the new flagship comes with the best of UFS. This new tech has blazing fast read and write speed, and with that at the helm, capturing 4K videos won’t be troublesome to the phone.  OnePlus 7  The OnePlus 7 Pro may have overshadowed a few smartphones already, but the phone that is completely eclipsed is the OnePlus 7. No one has reviewed the smartphone yet, and a lot of people still think the company only launched one phone this time. The OnePlus 7 is like this sibling who gets no attention from their parents.   But still, the OnePlus 7 is a capable device. It has a new processor and dual stereo speakers. It does share a few features with the 6T but that’s not a bad thing at all. And although the phone is a bit pricier in the UK, it’s cheaper than what the  OnePlus 6T  was available for in India!  The price is one of the things that I don’t like about the 7 Pro which brings me to my final point, the pricing of the OnePlus 7 Pro.  Pricing  The OnePlus 7 Pro costs $669 in the USA. So, why did I just complain about its pricing? Well, it’s the pricing elsewhere that I am not satisfied with. The phone runs of Rs. 49,000 in India which is a bit more considering the neck-to-neck pricing the older models had. And don’t get me started regarding its price in the UK. The base model of the 7 Pro costs £649 in the UK which converts to nearly $840. So, even though OnePlus has nailed the pricing in the USA, the company hasn’t lived up to what it actually stands for in other countries, and that’s a little bit disappointing.  Zen Mode   There are a lot of phones these days that have the ‘Digital Wellbeing’ feature on their devices. OnePlus has done its own take on the feature with its Zen mode. The Zen mode doesn’t control the use of applications but bars the users from using the phone altogether. It only lets users make calls and use the camera, but other than that, you don’t get to do anything on the OnePlus 7 Pro. This will come in handy when you have an assignment to complete.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/oneplus-7-pro-launched.jpg']

Of course, this was already teased when the Galaxy Active launched, but now it’s official.  Samsung Galaxy Fit e Overview  The Galaxy Fit e went official quietly. It’s basically, a smart fitness band which is a stripped down version of the Galaxy Fit. It’s got many of the same features as that one, but not all of them.

When it is fully unfolded, you can connect an external keyboard via Bluetooth and use it as a “laptop”.         Also, this device supports a  Wacom stylus , which clips onto the side. Starting to sound more and more like a tablet, isn’t it? Nonetheless, this 13.3″ laptop, being foldable is even more portable than your regular ultra-books.

However, this is the first time a Pro variant has launched alongside a regular variant. And there are some notable differences between the two. OnePlus always makes headlines because they provide the best value for money. And there are no two opinions about it.  This time, with the tagline “ Go Beyond Speed “, the phone launched simultaneously from 3 different places around the world – London, New York, and Bangalore, India. This is the first time the company has done so, but going by the popularity of OnePlus devices in recent times, it is plausible. Anyways, let’s see what these two phones bring us.  OnePlus 7 Pro Overview  Since this is the first time a Pro variant has launched, OnePlus 7 made sure to beef it up! It has a premium glass design, the standard for flagships, of course. But as usual, it comes with no IP rating. And judging by OnePlus’  CEO Pete Lau ‘s tweets, this feature is highly unlikely to arrive on upcoming OnePlus phones as well. Also, the OnePlus 7 Pro has a pop-up selfie camera to get that bezel-less display. The phone also features  Dual Stereo Speakers with Dolby Atmos sound .         The display on it is a large  6.67″ Fluid AMOLED panel  with  QHD+ resolution  and  90 Hz refresh rate . This is quite a different approach from the one the company usually takes, but a really welcome one! Because it’s the fastest screen on a mobile phone! Also, this also supports  HDR 10+ content . In addition,  DisplayMate gave OnePlus 7 Pro its highest rating  as well! In addition, it features Horizon Lighting, which is similar to Samsung’s Edge Lighting, that lights up the curved edges of the screen when you get a notification. What’s more? Its in-display fingerprint sensor  unlocks the phone in 0.21 seconds  – the fastest on any smartphone right now!  This phone has a  triple camera set up  at the back – a 48 MP primary camera, a 16 MP ultra-wide angle lens with 170-degree field of view and an 8 MP telephoto camera with 3X Optical zooming! The selfie camera rests at 16 MP on the pop-up module and has acclaimed durability of 300000 pop-ups. What’s more interesting is that DxO Mark has given it the 2nd highest camera rating of 111 after  Huawei P30 Pro  and  Samsung Galaxy S10+ 5G .  Internally, the OnePlus 7 Pro runs on the  Snapdragon 855  with  6 / 8 / 12 GB RAM  options. Plus, there’s RAM Boost feature which claims to load your frequently used apps faster. Storage options are 128 GB and 256 GB \xa0 with UFS 3.0, making it the first phone to do so. There’s Liquid Cooling inside it as well, so, heating is not an issue. The battery is a large  4000 mAh  with its  30-Watt Warp Charging,  which can charge your phone from 0 to 50% in 20 minutes! Oxygen 9.5 runs the show on top of Android Pie, and they promise\xa0 2 years of software updates and 3 years of security updates.  With the display and sound combination, it makes for one of the best media consumption devices. The phone is available in  three different colors : Almond, Nebula Blue, and Mirror Gray. And since the Pro model is the more expensive one, the  pricing starts at $669 for the base model . The 8 GB / 256 GB costs $699 while the 12 / 256 GB costs $749. That’s actually a lot better than European pricing, though, which demands £799 for the highest end model!

While the 7 Pro receives most of the beefy specs, the regular 7 doesn’t look much different than the  OnePlus 6T  – down to the design and display front. It’s because OnePlus 7 has the same design footprint of the 6T with the water-drop notch on it.   Its display is also smaller at  6.26″  and also employs an  Optic AMOLED panel . Also, it only has a regular  60 Hz refresh rate  and does not support HDR 10+ content either. There are only  two cameras  at the back – the primary 48 MP camera and a 5 MP depth sensor. At least, the camera megapixels stay the same. This is also the case with the  16 MP selfie camera .  However, it doesn’t skimp out on power. The OnePlus 7 runs on the  Snapdragon 855  and starts with  6 GB RAM  and 128 GB storage, and also an 8 GB / 256 GB variant. Also, this phone packs a slightly  smaller battery of 3700 mAh .

And out of those two, the Vivo V15 Pro is clearly the better sibling – both in terms of cameras and other aspects. The only problem could’ve been the price, here in Nepal. At a price of some Rs.52,500, this lies more on the expensive side. But, now, with a price drop, I think the V15 Pro is a deal sealer!   Vivo V15 Pro Overview  The V15 Pro features a  6.39″ Super AMOLED display  on a shiny plastic body. The display is a  Full HD+  one, with no bezels or notches.

The V15 Pro runs on the  Snapdragon 675 processor , which is pretty zippy. And combined with  6 GB RAM , that is enough power for most of your tasks. In addition, you get  128 GB storage  onboard by default. Furthermore, with a battery of  3700 mAh  and  Dual-Engine Fast Charging , this phone looks pretty good, doesn’t it?  Of course, the only problem, compared to its competitors like the  Galaxy A70  and the  Oppo F11 Pro , was its price. But now, it has received  Rs.2100 price drop!  With that, now, this phone is  priced at Rs.50,390 . Also, companies like Oppo and Vivo provide some discount while purchasing them, so, you might get it for lesser.

Of course, for mobile photography, it’s the  Huawei P30 Pro . For DSLRs, there are quite a number of cameras and lenses offering that. However, it could be the  Panasonic DC-FZ80K Lumix 4K  with 60X zoom offering the best long-range zoom. But of course, all of that is going to shame with this latest invention, an Ultra long-range AI camera that can  capture human subjects from up to 28 miles away !  Yes, that is correct. Scientists in China developed this camera which uses Lasers and AI technology. So, you can tell, this is not your typical commercial camera. This has broader usage than zooming in and spying on your neighbor or taking close up shots of the moon.  Source:  National Laboratory for Physical Sciences, Shanghai  This camera uses  LIDAR technology , which means  Light Detection and Ranging . Now, this technology has already been used in other types of imaging, but these images contained a ton of noise. But this time, the advanced computer image processing helps mitigate them.\xa0 According to the researcher Zheng-Ping Li’s paper, this camera can also cut through smog and other pollution elements using a mixture of laser imaging and advanced AI software.        This camera uses a laser to  judge the distance of a subject by recording the time taken to reflect back to the machine , the new software can also help ignore everything else that falls out of that time. Also, this feature helps the camera set specific distances.  In addition, this machine uses an infrared laser at a  wavelength of 1550 nanometers , which makes the camera safe for use without any side effects to any creature. Furthermore, it also guards the image against solar photons that interfere with the camera resolution.\xa0Ultimately, the new AI software uses the sparse data collected by the machine to help form a recognizable image.  This kind of technology can help achieve high-resolution, fast, low-power 3D optical imaging over ultralong ranges, and has a broad set of applications. It opens new venues for  advanced surveillance, remote sensing, and GIS .']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ultra-long-range-ai-camera-2.jpg']

With their new A-series and M-series smartphones’ lineup, Samsung has quite handsomely populated the midrange territory. Amongst all the smartphones launched so far, not all of the handsets are available for purchase in India. Since India is a leading smartphone superpower, Samsung wouldn’t want to lose a land of 1.3 billion population. And a new teaser leak supports the statement. The leaked teaser hints that the smartphone giant seems to be striding to launch a new phone in India.  A new poster with Samsung branding came into limelight, which originated from the Twitter account of an Indian tipster Sudhanshu Ambhore (@Sudhanshu1414). The tipster claims that the poster is a teaser, which Samsung seems to be working on to announce a new upcoming phone in India. The teaser contains the text “#OMG” followed by “Coming Soon” right below it. In the #OMG, the “O” is highlighted with a slight green accent, where the rest of the texts are plain white. From this subtle design, we draw a conclusion that the upcoming Samsung smartphone in India would come with an Infinity-O display. Infinity-O is the fancy name for the displays with a punched-hole display like that on the flagship  Galaxy S10 devices .   This is a leaked teaser from  @SamsungMobileIN  about an upcoming device.

The first one is the  Samsung Galaxy A60 , which was launched in China a few weeks back. There were rumors that the Samsung Galaxy A60 would be China exclusive phone. But with the teasers like this, we cannot be entirely sure about that.  Another possible option would be the  Samsung Galaxy M40 , which is yet to make an official debut. Nonetheless, the phone leaked on numerous occasions. Also, there were a fair number of speculations regarding its imminent launch in India. So that could also be another possible guess.  If we ignore the accented-O and focus on the rest of the text, we can deduce that Samsung is going to launch a phone in India, which could leave everyone awe-inspired. And among the vast list of Samsung phones, one of them is possibly the  Galaxy A80 . The A80 comes with a full-view display without any sorts of notches or punched-hole cutouts.

But these days we can see some decent phones in the market available under $100 price mark. And I was always suspicious regarding such phones since we can see manufacturers making a ton of compromises to keep the prices low. But how different is the Samsung entry-level Galaxy A2 Core from the rest? And how good of a performer is it when it comes to real-life use? Let’s find out in this Samsung Galaxy A2 Core review.   Samsung Galaxy A2 Core specifications   5-inch (540 x 960 pixels) qHD TFT display  1.6GHz Octa-Core Exynos 7870 processor with Mali T830 GPU  1GB RAM, 16GB storage, expandable memory up to 256GB with microSD  Android 9.0 Pie (Go edition)  Dual SIM  5MP rear camera with LED flash, f/1.9 aperture  5MP Front-facing camera  Dimensions:141.6 x 71 x 9.1mm; Weight: 142g  3.5mm audio jack, FM Radio  4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2 LE,\xa0GPS  2600mAh battery  Price:  Rs. 9,390  Rs. 8,999   Design  On the side, the handset looks vaguely similar to the last year’s J2 Core. The plastic material on the back and thick bezels on the front with the Samsung branding on the chin is barely distinguishable. But what sets the A2 core apart is its glossy plastic back, which is non-removable this time. And since most of the entry-level devices come with the dull and cheap looking plastic material, the glossy finishing here has made the device somewhat elegant than the rest.              1  of 5               Back         Bezels                Ports         Buttons                           With glossy back, phones are usually slippery and they fall from the hands quite often. But that’s not the case here. The phone comes in small size and it rests comfortably on the hand. That’s why the device never slipped through my hands on the normal use.  But the thing I am not convinced about is the navigation buttons. Despite having a thick chin on the button, Samsung has included the navigation button on to the screen. I think Samsung could’ve done better than that.  Display  When it comes to the display, Samsung has employed a 5-inch qHD IPS panel here. Not the Quad-HD like the  Galaxy S10 and S10+  but a quarter-HD, which is less sharp than the HD display. So you can’t quite find crispy details on its screen.  Redmi Go  has implemented HD resolution on its screen so I expected the same from Samsung. But that’s not the case here. But since it’s an entry-level device, we cannot really complain much about that, can we?   And talking about the brightness, you might have to struggle a little in the scorching sunlight but most of the time, the screen is legible. But since the device doesn’t have an ambient light sensor, users have to adjust the display brightness manually on time and often.  Camera  Now let’s talk about the camera. The phone comes with a 5MP camera on both the front and on the back. When it comes to the image quality, I found the rear camera surprisingly good for its price. Colors look good and the images have a good amount of details in the good light. Focusing can get tricky here though. So have to keep your hands steady while capturing the images.        1  of 14                                                                                                                                                              Also, dynamic range is not something to fuss about in an entry-level segment but if I had to speak about it, I would say it’s not that great here. Shadow details are completely crushed, so you have to manage with the details of the highlights only.  When it comes to the low light, the images look mushy and have quite a lot of noise on them. So they are mostly unusable.        1  of 3                                                Talking about the selfie camera, it’s decent and does the job well most of the time. In ample light, the selfies look good with a decent amount of details. But in artificial light and low light condition, selfies look soft with the missing facial details. I don’t know if it’s really that important, but the phone also has a beauty mode.        1  of 5               Selfie in Ample Light         Selfie in Artificial Light         Selfie in Ample Light         Selfie in Artificial Light         Selfie in Ample Light                           On the videography side, both the cameras are capable of capturing 1080p videos at max.  For high res images,  click here .  Performance & Software  The phone comes with Android Go version of the Android Oreo. With the Android Go on the board, you can see the Go or the Lite version of apps as well like the Gmail Go, Files Go, YouTube Go and so on.  When it comes to the performance part, the A2 Core really nails it on the entry-level segment. It comes with Exynos 7870 chipset and has 1GB of RAM under the hood. Since the Android Go is really optimized, the phone does well even with 1GB RAM. And with the Exynos 7870 chipset on the board, it handles most of the workloads pretty fluidly.  I couldn’t play PUBG and Asphalt 9 but when I played some heavy titles like the Dead Trigger 2 and Asphalt 8, I didn’t face any major lags or stutters.  On the storage side of things, the phone rocks with a 16GB of onboard memory. It also comes with a dedicated SD card slot for memory expansion. With more storage, the A2 Core seriously has an edge over the Redmi Go. And I was also quite happy with this generosity on a Samsung phone.  Battery  Now the battery. The phone comes with a 2600mAh battery, which is not much according to the recent standards. But given the low-res display and the power-efficient chipset, the phone provides a good endurance. On my use, the phone always backed me up for more than a day on the normal use. At the end of the day, I was always left with 35% or more charge left on the phone. Standby backup is also pretty good here. So you have nothing worry here.  But I cannot say the same when it comes to charging the device. The phone comes with a 3.5-watt charger on the box, which you can already guess takes a significant time to charge the device.  Conclusion  So the Samsung Galaxy A2 Core is a great phone with amazing performance, a good amount of storage, good design for its price and obviously it’s budget-friendly price. It goes super easy on the wallet and does most of the job really good.   I would have loved to see an HD display and a faster charger but I think that’s some cutdowns Samsung made to keep the price low. And that sort of downsides are usually evident on the entry-level devices. So if you are thinking of buying an entry-level smartphone for your old folks or even for yourself, you can’t go wrong with the A2 Core.

['Google Pixel 3A and 3XL Impressions – Not enough value for money'],['Google Pixel'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 10, 2019']",2019-05-10 12:33:25+00:00,"['So, for the last couple of days, the new  Google Pixel 3A  and 3A XL has gathered quite a lot of attention, and obviously for good reasons. The same great  Pixel 3  camera for some half the price! Sweet, right? But they’re not the best value for money devices!  Why? Let’s start with the “same camera” on both. There’s actually a slight difference. The hardware is the same – both use the same  Sony IMX363 sensor  and have Google’s all-powerful photography computing, however, the image processing is a bit slower on the 3A.         Compared to Pixel 3, the 3A takes some 2 seconds more to produce a final image after processing. That’s because the 3A lacks the  Pixel Visual Core Camera  – which is a dedicated image processor on the high-end Pixel devices. So, the 3A devices depend solely on the ISP (Image Signal Processors) of the chipset – in this case, the  Spectra 250 , due to which it takes a longer to produce the final image output.  Still, compared to the  Huawei P30 Pro  and  Galaxy S10 Plus , the camera outshines both. Because, who are we kidding? It’s the same camera sensor and software…apart from that tiny detail. Plus, you get Google’s full-fledged  Night Sight feature  on this device. So, needless to say, the camera on this device is absolutely amazing…you just have to live with slower processing.  The front camera, however, has been toned down. It is, now, an  8 MP camera , which still, produces great results. For videos, you get OIS and EIS support, so, they’re definitely going to be stable.  But what’s great here, is the software. Being Google’s devices, they run on the latest version of Android Pie, not to mention they’ll get the latest of software updates and security patches till October 2021.   The display on these differs from the Pixel 3 devices, too. The  3A has a 5.6” display  and the  3AXL has a bigger 6-inch display . However, what’s different, here, is the display panels. Pixel 3 devices came with  P-OLED panels , which meant plastic OLED screens. This time, around, they went with  gOLED . And as much as I’d like to know what gOLED really means, Google hasn’t really specified what it stands for.  But whatever that may mean, the display with  Full HD+ resolution  still look sharp and vibrant. Although, it comes with a less popular DragonTail glass protection on top. However, despite the good displays, Google didn’t seem to care enough to reduce the bezels on these. It still rocks the old school design – at a time when water-drop notches or punch-hole displays are the trends. In this crowd, it looks like a phone straight outta 2017.  But then again, maybe Google wanted to differentiate it from others. And since it’s a toned down version of Pixel 3, maybe they didn’t want to deviate from their signature design. I’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Also, on the design front, it goes fully polycarbonate from the glass back. But for the price, a plastic body seems like a bit too less.  Another step down here is the performance. It runs on the Snapdragon 670, which is a decent performer, but competitors, for similar pricing are packing more powerful chipsets – like the  Pocophone F1 ,  Realme 3 Pro , and the  Redmi Note 7 Pro . So, maybe, they should’ve gone with a Snapdragon 730, or even 675?  Again, another letdown is the storage. There’s  64 GB onboard , but  no expandable option . 64 GB, in 2019, feels like the bare minimum, and there are no other variants with larger storage. What’s more disappointing is that you don’t get to store your original images in Unlimited Storage – only a high-quality version.  While we’re still talking about letdowns, the battery isn’t that great, either. The Pixel 3A gets a  3000 mAh battery  while the 3AXL has a  3700 mAh battery . Although its bigger than what we saw on both the 3 and 3XL, it isn’t much compared to the likes of Samsung, Realme and Redmi mid-rangers. So, the endurance takes a hit, too.  With all these, I can’t exactly say these are great phones. Actually, they do seem good…it’s just the competition seems better. Of course, the camera prowess is unmatched, but the price is, too. For a starting  price of $39 9 in the US, it might be a good deal. But, the pricing is not the same in every country.  And If you look at the price in India, they cost like  INR. 40,000  and  INR.45000  respectively, for which, you can get the upcoming Oneplus flagship with fancier designs, bigger displays, and better processors.  And not to mention, Phones like Redmi Note 7 Pro and Realme 3 Pro come at half the price! Moreover, Realme X and Redmi K20 Pro are launching soon, so I would rather wait for those phones.  What Google’s selling, however, is the brand name, those crisp stock Android software updates and the cameras of course. But still, for the price, the Pixel 3A and 3AXL don’t look all that appealing to me.  In the end, it comes down to what you prefer…if you want to have a standout Google device, you won’t really go wrong with them, but if you prefer value for money, I just think there’s plenty of fish in the sea!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/google-pixel-3a-xl-specs.jpg']

I mean…really wowed…not just thought “Well that’s cool!” but really fascinated by? For me, I can remember two moments – one when the  OnePlus 2  came out, and next when the  Google Pixel  was launched. Now, of course, there have been moments far more revolutionizing – like the 1 st  iPhone, for instance, but I was too young to remember that.  The First iPhone   But the first iPhone was a revolution, no doubt. Before that, the concept of a multi-touch screen was wacky. The first iPhone, however, limited by its inability to record video or having no selfie camera, was a big step for mankind in smartphone technology. Today’s phones, however, with giant vibrant touch-screens and four or five cameras, seem like nothing but add-ons.        And that makes me think “Did we go wrong somewhere?” Because even after having the most powerful of processors, and featuring everything from flashlights, wallets, music players, alarms, and what-not, phones are not as exciting as they used to be.  All about additions  Reviewing smartphones were exciting. These days…it’s not the phones that excite me, but only certain features in them. The point is, there hasn’t been any drastic changes/upgrades in smartphones, especially in recent years. New phones launch year after year, and despite millions of them selling around the world, phones are becoming more similar to one another than ever. All we see, in the latest iteration of phones are faster processors, more RAM, more storage, and more cameras.   This might sound hypocritical because our smartphone reviews seem exciting. But the reason is, some features of new smartphones are really exciting. For instance, the cameras of the latest  Huawei P30 Pro  and the new Dynamic AMOLED displays in the  Galaxy S10  series, are fascinating. But even so, smartphones are going from aspirational to inspirational!  Smartphones don’t solve problems anymore!  What I mean is, we’ve actually run out of actual problems for smartphones to solve. These devices have matured to something that does almost everything we want them to? And so, we’re instead creating new problems and running around trying to solve them?   What am I talking about? Well, was a full bezel-less display really necessary? Because to solve that very problem, we employed notches to tear-drop notches to punch-holes and pop-up cameras! And some phones like the  ZTE Nubia X  removes selfie cameras completely for dual screens! What is really the point?  One of the reasons for such crazy development is that we’ve reached the innovation ceiling. Where do we go from here? And so, companies are bringing out features, not innovation. Smartphones are becoming so good, they’re boring now. Everyone is introducing the latest and the best. The race is over…everyone’s winning! But the thing is, when everyone becomes special, no one really is!  Some are still trying…   Again, some are trying really hard to stand out! Foldable phones were but a concept. And now, we have the  Royole Flex Pai ,  Galaxy Fold ,  Huawei Mate X , and a bunch more to come! See what I mean? An idea is not much of innovation because, everyone will sooner, or later, come out with the same stuff. In a few years, we will be bored with foldable phones too!   Then there’s the  Energizer Power Max P18K , trying to sell a phone attached to a massive battery. Kudos to them for trying, but that is too crazy of an idea for us to get behind!  What we can all agree on, however, is that smartphone innovation has come to a crawl. Smartphone makers are having a hard time justifying the yearly upgrade cycles, and people are upgrading their phones less and less. Smartphones have become great at lasting longer – because they’re actually quite good!  What are the reasons?  The reason we don’t really see anything drastically new is that companies come up with, or rather HAVE to come up with new smartphones every year. One year may not be enough time to create something really innovative…but if they don’t, their market share takes the hit…and the competition is really tough!  Another reason is profit maximization. Of course, companies need profit to exist, but I believe that this has led to companies doing the bare minimum when it comes to phones. They just slap on a subtle improvement over the same phone, brand it as something else, and off it goes into the market. Take the  Redmi Y3 , for example – a newly launched device, but it’s basically the  Redmi 7  with a 32 MP selfie camera!  In addition, since there isn’t much room to improve on the hardware front, it’s the software that companies are starting to focus on. For example, Huawei’s all about that AI experience – using AI in everything – from the camera, to performance and well, almost everything. Samsung shoots out raw power, while Apple focuses mostly on its ecosystem. And while good software does lead to better user experience, it isn’t a convincing factor for people to go and buy a new smartphone year after year.  What’s Next?  So, yes, smartphones have, I think, reached this ceiling…to go beyond that, we’d need something crazy, yet something that’ll also prove to be useful. Smartphones, right now, are about evolution, not revolution. And I don’t think any such revolution is right around the corner. More of the same is coming. And Key-Note speeches of new phones are already getting boring, and in a year or two, I don’t think I’ll even be interested in any of them.  Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars and work tirelessly to implement new tech, but what we have right now, is pretty good too. So, what happens next is anyone’s guess. Either we’ll have to live with what we have now…or go for something weird that’s coming.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Smartphones-getting-boring-feature.jpg']
['This is the new Night King! Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode'],"['Huawei', 'Phone Comparison', 'Samsung']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 10, 2019']",2019-05-10 10:26:59+00:00,"['The  Huawei P30 Pro ’s been gathering quite the attention with the cameras it’s packing. And comparing its cameras to the  GalaxyS10  or S10 Plus has been the hot topic these days. And most of these comparisons have been yielding the same result, people – the P30 Pro does better in some aspects while the S10 shines out in another. One of the aspects, however, was the low-light images, or the Night mode. And we compare both the phones in those aspects in Huawei P30 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode.  With the latest update on the S10 series, it  made the Night Mode on it a dedicated feature . Samsung devices previously had this feature as  Bright Light , which was under Scene Optimizer. But now, it’s right there in the Camera UI for convenience. And that was necessary because other rival flagships all have that feature.  Google Pixel 3  and the Huawei P30 Pro’s Night Modes have gathered quite a bit of attention from all the photography enthusiasts. And I thought, maybe the S10 stands a chance to be there with the champions, too. So, I tested out the new night mode on the Galaxy S10, and compared it with the P30 Pro as it is, right now, the “Night King”!        Huawei P30 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode Camera Samples  A bit of clarification here. I took some samples in a tough condition. There was just a tiny amount of light, and here’s the first image. If you need any justification to see the clear winner, check out the details on the shot from the P30 Pro.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 2               P30 Pro Night Mode         Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode                  In our daylight camera comparison, we did on the P30 Pro review, the S10+’s details were no match for the P30 Pro, and the same is the case here. Check out the area right below the gate, you can definitely see things clearly on the P30 Pro. As for the S10, well, the only thing that pops out on this first photo is the colors.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 2               P30 Pro         S10 Plus                  On the 2 nd  photo too, the S10+ brings in better colors than the P30 Pro. The P30 Pro has this tendency of whitening certain aspects of the image, or sometimes all of them, and you can see that too in some of the samples. What the P30 Pro does best, yet again, is the detail. And I for me personally, the sky looks better on the pictures from the P30 Pro as well. But if you want a more natural looking image, the S10 Plus seems a bit better.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus   1  of 2               P30 Pro         S10 Plus                  If you want to see the color thing I was talking about here’s the example. The blue color on this house here is more pronounced on the S10+, while the P30 Pro seems a bit washed out.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 2               P30 Pro         S10 Plus                  The 4 th  image in my comparison reveals the ugly side of the P30 Pro – how it massacres the natural lighting with its tendency to overexpose stuff. Galaxy S10+ on the other hand, does it better, by balancing it out. Here, too, the details from the P30 Pro takes the cake, but if you look at the overall image, the S10 simply does it better.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 2               P30 Pro         S10 Plus                  But here’s something that makes the difference between these two phones clear as day. Check out the background of this image. And check out that contrast on the photo. Wow, the P30 Pro can really shine in the night time! The details, the contrast, the exposure, everything is well done in this photo here, and it’s one of my favorites of the bunch. Here, too, the S10 does the colors well but fails in details and contrast.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 10               P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus                                          Here are some other photos for you to see. In all of these images, the difference is clear. If you look for colors, the S10 Plus does it better…but there are more elements visible on the P30 Pro. More details, and less noise. And I think, that is the point of having a Night Mode, isn’t it?      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 6               P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus                              One thing I noticed, however, is the P30 Pro does something with these small light sources. Check out the lamps, for example. The P30 Pro tends to throw some light beams around – making it kinda dance all over the image. The S10 Plus doesn’t do that…and yet if you look at this image, the P30 does the better job despite its “dancing lights”.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 4               P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus                        However, when it comes to human subjects, the S10 has the edge. P30’s tendency to apply this whitish effect on the images makes for a bit colder skin tones, while the S10 gives more natural looking faces. And if you want to take others’ photos at night, S10 is the way to go.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 6               P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus                              And, here are other images where the P30 Pro clearly shines. It has better details and better exposure. Granted, the colors look better on the S10 Plus, but there is still a bit of noise present in the photos. The reason for that is the S10 Plus detects the amount of light and decides its own time for a long exposure…while the exposure time on the P30 Pro is always the same.      Huawei P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 4               P30 Pro         S10 Plus         P30 Pro         S10 Plus                        If you look at this image, noise, and grains are seen on the sky on this photo. The S10+’s image looks a lot darker than the other one. The P30 Pro has done quite a work to handle the light sources too. Check out that light on the terrace.      Huawei 30 Pro vs Galaxy S10 Plus Night Mode   1  of 2               P30 Pro         S10 Plus                  Speaking of light, this image on the P30 Pro is really lighted up for something that was taken late in the night. But it looks a bit blur. This happened once or twice as the night mode pictures take several seconds to capture. It is what you have to pay to get a good shot during night time.  Conclusion  I’ll put it there right away. Even in the night mode, the S10 and the P30 Pro are winners in their own aspects and mostly tie up…mostly! But if you look at all the things, the P30 Pro is the winner, here – albeit by a small difference. \xa0Still, the Galaxy S10 did a commendable job – even after receiving the Night Mode update only recently. And it’s a first generation feature on a Samsung device, so, needs to improve.  Huawei, however, brags about the P30 Pro camera’s night capability, and as much as they can prove it, they still need to improve some aspects. This was a camera that beat the Pixel 3 in this regard. Even in the dimmest of light, the lenses on the phone do great work in preserving the overall details of the images, all while controlling the noise and grains. But its tendency to overexpose and throw the lights around makes it take some strange night shots.  So, my verdict stands –\xa0 P30 Pro wins, however, the S10 is very close behind. If the trend continues, and Samsung improves on this, we might even see a new Night King down the line.  Also Watch: Samsung Galaxy S10 Review!

['Samsung announces 64MP and 48MP sensors for smartphones’ cameras'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 10, 2019']",2019-05-10 09:30:40+00:00,"['Since the beginning of 2019, we have been hearing about a number of smartphones, which features a 48MP camera. And sensor used by most of such smartphones had used Samsung’s sensors. It was highest of the resolution for any smartphone camera and Samsung was sharing this feat with Sony. But to leap further, Samsung is planning to launch higher resolution sensors. The South Korean tech giant has recently announced that the company would be launching 64MP Samsung ISOCELL Bright GW1 and 48MP ISOCELL Bright GM2 sensors to set the benchmark in smartphone photography. With the announcement of these two sensors, Samsung hopes to expand its 0.8μm pixel image sensors lineup.  Samsung ISOCELL Bright GW1 sensor (64MP sensor)  Let’s talk about the 64MP sensor first. Dubbed as Samsung ISOCELL Bright GW1, the sensor comes with a size of 1/1.72-inch. It is slightly larger than its earlier 48MP sensor, which comes at the 1/2.0-inch size. Although the sensor can capture images at a native resolution of 64MP, it can also shoot 16MP sharp and bright images making use of the  Tetracell technology (4-in-1 pixel binning) . With the pixel size of 0.8μm, the low light capabilities of the sensor could be a concern. But Samsung included the following statement in its press release to clear the doubts.  “To take pictures resembling the way the human eye perceives its surroundings in a mixed light environment, GW1 supports real-time high dynamic range (HDR) of up to 100-decibels (dB) that provides richer hues. In comparison, the dynamic range of a conventional image sensor is at around 60dB, while that of the human eye is typically considered to be around 120dB.”        Apart from that, the ISOCELL GW1 sensor also comes with Dual Conversion Gain or DCG. The DCG in the sensor converts the light received by the sensor into electric signals. And the amount of electric signals depends upon the intensity of light hitting the sensor. With the DCG on the system, Samsung promises that the sensor would efficiently utilize the light resulting in the brighter images. GW1 sensor also flaunts Super Phase Detection Autofocus Technology for smooth and jitter-free focusing. Furthermore, the sensor is also said to record Full-HD slow motion videos up to 480 fps.  Samsung ISOCELL Bright GM2 sensor (48MP sensor)  The second one to get announced is the Samsung ISOCELL Bright GM2 sensor. This look like the refreshed version of the ISOCELL GM1 sensor, which is found on the Redmi Note 7. Just like the GM1 sensor, this one also uses Tetracell technology to merge 4 pixels into 1 in the low light setting. The sensor also comes with DCG and Super Phase Detection Autofocus system, which was also existent on the GM1.  The sensors are currently in the sampling stage and Samsung says to start mass production in the second half of 2019. So before the end of this year, we may be able to see numerous smartphone flaunting high-res camera sensors.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/samsung-isocell-bright-gw1-gm2-sensor.jpg']

The Oppo A7 is such a phone, that catches your eye, but, sadly nothing else. It does look attractive, yes, but the price was not justified at all. And since its launch, it has received a few price drop. But, finally, with a major discount for the festival of Ramadan, will it be finally worth it after the Oppo A7 price drop?  Oppo A7 Overview   The Oppo A7, as aforementioned, does look attractive on first glance. It has a polycarbonate body, but shiny glossy finish. The display is a  6.2″ IPS LCD  panel with a waterdrop notch, which is the trend, anyway. But the resolution is only HD+, so, gotta live with that. However, it’s not the first time such a large screen had only HD+ resolution.        Furthermore, it packs a dual camera at the back – which seems like the base standard of dual cameras – a  13 MP primary lens  with a  2 MP depth sensor . However, the selfie-centric phone comes with a good 16 MP camera. And also, it’s got a huge  4230 mAh battery , which will last you two days on normal usage.  However, the phone runs on a low-end  Snapdragon 450 processor.  It’s got a  4 GB RAM , and  64 GB storage , but then again, the bottle-neck is already the processor. This is the main reason, the initial price was not good for this phone. But now, it gets Rs.5000 off! So, you can now buy this phone now, for  Rs.27,990 ! Still, with phones like Redmi Note 7 out there that provide much more for the price…I doubt this is worth it.

The rumors hinted the name of the device as  Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 . Although Huawei is yet to confirm the existence of the Y9 Prime 2019, the company seems to be rushing forward to launch another smartphone with the pop-up selfie camera. Huawei P Smart Z is the Huawei’s latest midrange phone, which recently appeared in Spain and Italy’s Amazon website.  Huawei P Smart Z Overview:  On the design front, the P Smart Z comes with a dual-tone finish on the back, which gives the vibe of the Pixel devices. But unlike the pixel devices, it comes with a dual camera setup at the back. The primary 16MP shooter comes alongside a 2MP depth sensor for better portrait shots. But the biggest highlight on the device is its camera on the front. There is a 16MP selfie shooter on the front, which pops up in a motorized fashion.         This motorized selfie shooter takes around 1 second to elevate fully from its resting position. The Pop-up camera is said to withstand a force of 12Kg and can last 100,000 cycles. It is quite low if compared with the Vivo V15 Pro. The  Vivo V15 Pro  is promised to last for 300,000 cycles of pop-ups. Both the front and back cameras on this device are AI-powered. With AI on the board, the camera can recognize over 500 scenes and can retouch the portrait shots.  And endorsing the elevating camera on the front, Huawei did away with the notches, which exists on most of their recent phones. Without the notch, the 6.59-inch display on the device looks immersive. The screen on the device is provided with Full-HD+ resolution.   Performance wise, the phone gets the HiSilicon Kirin 710F processor. Huawei P Smart Z also comes aboard with 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal memory. There is also an option to expand the memory using an SD card slot.  Powering the device is a 4000mAh battery. The phone comes with a USB Type-C port, however, there is no mention of the fast charging support. On to the software part, the phone boots on Android 9 Pie out of the box.

['Semi Flagship showdown – Samsung Galaxy S10e vs Huawei P30'],"['Huawei', 'Phone Comparison', 'Samsung']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 8, 2019']",2019-05-08 12:14:52+00:00,"['Smartphone companies are trying to one-up each other by releasing variants of their flagships. Samsung’s S10 series’ lowest-end model is the  Galaxy S10e , while Huawei has the P30. Now, these “lowest end” models don’t skimp out on power though. Both of these come with flagship processors and many of the flagship features. So, we thought it would be interesting to compare these two devices. Here’s our take on Semi Flagship showdown: Samsung Galaxy S10e vs Huawei P30!  Samsung Galaxy S10e vs Huawei P30 Specs Comparison:      Samsung Galaxy S10e  Huawei P30    Design  Glass body (Gorilla Glass 5), aluminum frame  Glass body, aluminum frame    Display  5.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED Full HD+ display, (1080 x 2280 pixels), HDR10+, punch-hole display  6.1-inch OLED Full HD+ display, (1080 x 2340 pixels), HDR10, water-drop notch    Rear Camera  Dual Camera setup, 12 MP primary lens with f/1.5 – 2.4 + 16 MP ultra-wide with f/2.2  Triple-camera setup, 40 MP Super Spectrum lens with f/1.8 + 16 MP ultra-wide with f/2.2 + 8 MP telephoto lens with f/2.4 (3X Optical Zoom)    Front Camera  10 MP with f/1.9, wide, Dual Pixel, PDAF  32 MP with f/2.0, wide, HDR    Chipset  Exynos 9820  Kirin 980    GPU  Mali-G76 MP12  Mali-G76 MP10    RAM  8 GB  8 GB    Storage  128 / 256 GB  64 / 128 / 256 GB    Operating System  Android 9.0 Pie with One UI  Android 9.0 Pie with EMUI 9.1    Color Options  Prism Black, Prism Blue  Breathing Crystal, Aurora Blue    Features  Fingerprint (side-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, ANT+  Fingerprint (under-display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, 3.5 mm headphone jack    Battery  3100 mAh, 15-Watt Fast-Charging  3650 mAh, 22-Watt Fast Charging    Price  $750 (Rs.94,000) / Available for Rs.74,000 online via sastodeal  €799 (Rs.84,900)     Design and Build  In terms of design and build quality, both these phones differ a lot. The Samsung Galaxy S10e has a glass back, which is  Gorilla Glass 5,  by the way, and is mostly safe against scratches and such. Plus, you also get the  IP68 Dust and Water   resistance . The P30, on the other hand, has a glass back, but it’s not Gorilla Glass, so, it’s more prone to scratches. And it is  only IP53 rated  against dust and splashes. So, the  build quality goes to the S10e!\xa0         Also, the S10e has a new design language than its predecessors and is a breath of fresh air. It’s small, compact, fits in your hands just right, and even if the buttons are a little out of place, it’s easy to reach with your hands. The P30 Pro looks and feels similar to last year’s  P20 …down to the dual-tone gradient color choice. It also fits in your hands quite well.   But when you keep these two, side by side, the  P30 just looks better than the S10e !  Display  The Samsung Galaxy S10e, being a bit smaller, packs a  5.8” Dynamic AMOLED  display while the P30 has a slightly larger  6.1” OLED panel . Now, Dynamic AMOLED is superior to regular OLED, in more ways than one. Dynamic AMOLED has better color reproduction, be more vivid and a  100% color accuracy in the DCI-P3 color gamut  coverage. In addition, nobody, to date, has done a better job at displays than Samsung! Playing HDR 10 contents on both on same brightness levels reveals S10e to be superior!   But, to my surprise, playing normal content (regular Full HD+ video) on both phones at max brightness led to the P30 being slightly better. If you don’t believe me, you can check that out for yourself. The Dynamic AMOLED doesn’t make much of a difference against P30’s regular OLED panel in this regard. Maybe, it’s the better brightness, but the P30’s looks better.  In terms of the viewing experience, both are more or less the same. Both of these phones have a similar amount of bezels on the side and a chin. As for the notch layout, the  S10e opted for a punch-hole  one, calling it the Infinity-O. The P30 sticks with a  water-drop style notch  in the center. However, the size of these notches is the same. Be it punch-hole or a water-drop, it’s only the position that differs. It’s just a matter of preference where you prefer it to be. While I think that the  S10e’s approach looks cleaner , the slightly bigger display of the P30 gives it an edge.  Cameras  Okay, now, the cameras. Now, there have been numerous camera comparison videos between these two phones, so, this is going to be quick. I don’t feel the need to talk about every little detail in length, so, here goes.    The S10e packs dual cameras at the back – a regular  12 MP camera and a 16 MP ultra-wide camera . Whereas, the P30 has an edge with its triple set up – a  40 MP regular camera, a 16 MP ultra-wide and an 8 MP telephoto lens  that gives you up to 3X Optical Zoom. And after clicking a lot of pictures with these two phones, here’s the conclusion:  The Samsung Galaxy S10e does a better job for your regular point-and-shoot photo sessions. The P30, on the other hand, has a lot of functions and modes to get that “right” picture to your necessity.      Huawei P30 Samples   1  of 4               Details         Cold skin tone         Whitish Color tone                                   Samsung Galaxy S10e Samples   1  of 4               Details         Accurate Skin tone         Vibrant color                               If we talk regular image quality, as you can see, the  S10e produces warmer colors  that look more pleasing to the eye. As for the P30, the color tone is as cold as my ex-girlfriend’s heart! However, none of these are quite that accurate though. The real look was somewhere between these two, but the  S10e tips more to the accurate side  on the scales. Also, you get a  more accurate HDR on the S10e .  However, both of them pack plenty of details. There’s no clear winner in terms of the sharpness and such. But if you talk resolution, the  P30 lets you take 40 MP images ! But it’s a shame that you cannot take ultra-wide shots or zoom in with that lens, and the default sits at 10 MP anyways.      Huawei P30 AI mode vs normal   1  of 4               Normal          AI Mode         Normal         AI Mode                            Samsung Galaxy S10e Scene Optimizer vs Normal   1  of 4               Normal         Scene Optimizer         Normal         Scene Optimizer                        S10e’s Scene Optimizer does a good job of keeping the colors balanced and stuff while the AI mode on P30 is a bit more aggressive. While the normal images look cold with a slightly greenish-pinkish tint, the AI mode is a burst of oversaturated colors, and it’s the greens that take a lot of hit on it. But some pictures simply look great with the AI mode on!      Huawei P30 Camera modes   1  of 3               Regular         Vivid Mode         Smooth Mode                     In addition, the  P30 has these various color modes  – Vivid Colors for deeper colors for some stunning DSLR quality images and Smooth Colors which, seems to me, a slightly toned down version of the Vivid Mode. But use these modes only according to necessity, because these can make for highly polished and unnatural-looking photos as well.      Huawei P30 Portrait Samples   1  of 4               P30 Portrait 1         P30 Portrait 2         Portrait effect 1         Portrait effect 2                            Galaxy S10e Portrait   1  of 4               Normal Portrait         Zoom Bokeh Effect         Spiral bokeh effect         Monochrome effect                        Portrait mode, on both, is great. Edge detection, on both, can be a bit of a hit-and-miss, as it is, with most phone cameras. The Galaxy S10 series offers  4 different effects on its portrait images  and lets you change the intensity of the background blur and effects post-clicks as well. It only suffers from edge-detection on the monochrome effect sometimes. The  P30 series gives you quite a few of those effects , and it’s difficult to tell the difference between some of them. But there is no monochrome filter, which I liked on the S10e.      Huawei P30 Ultra-wide   1  of 6               Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide                                  Galaxy S10e Ultra-wide   1  of 6               Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide                              In terms of wide-angle images, the  S10e gives you a wider angle than the P30 , but there is a fish-eye effect in those photos, which is not the case with the P30. Colors on both look great, but the  dynamic range on the P30 seems slightly better .      Huawei P30 Zoom   1  of 9               Normal         3X Zoom         5X Zoom         Normal         3X Zoom         5X Zoom         10X Zoom         20X Zoom         30X Zoom                                       And, the main advantage the P30 has over the S10e is its telephoto lens. With a  3X Optical zoom , which goes all the way to a 30X digital, you can get shots you never imagined. Of course, keeping the view stable beyond 10X requires you to have a gimbal, and all that zoom is not even useful, but it is kinda fun to use.      Huawei P30 Selfies   1  of 5               Selfie 1         Selfie 2         Portrait Selfie 1         Portrait Selfie 2         Night Selfie                               Samsung Galaxy S10e Selfie   1  of 5               Selfie 1         Selfie 2                       Night Selfie                           Selfies, for me, were simply better on the P30 . The  32 MP front camera  on it just packs more details in it than the  10 MP on the S10e . Also, even with the wide-angle option the S10e, it cannot get all that angle the P30 can give you. Portrait selfies looked good on both of the phones, but my money is on the P30 here, too.      Huawei P30 Night Mode   1  of 4               Normal         Night Mode on         Normal         Night Mode on                            Samsung Galaxy S10e Night Images   1  of 2               Normal         Night Mode (Bright Light) on                  The  night time is where the P30 shines! \xa0With its  Night shot , it can take images that are simply not possible on the S10e. Of course, under ample lighting at night, it’s the S10e that does a better job. But night shots like these are simply a good option to have, albeit with a bit of noise in them. Even without the Night mode, the P30 takes good night shots, thanks to the RYYB filter on the lens.  As for videos, both have great video quality. But the  S10e can take 4K videos at 60 fps while the P30 caps out at 30 . Plus, video stabilization on the S10e is slightly better, while its  Super Steady mode  is a lot better as well. Even for Super-Slow motion, the quality of the S10e is better. But, the P30 offers you a lot of other image options, like a Super-Macro shot, which is not possible with the S10e.  So, it’s kinda like this:  What the S10e offers, the P30 doesn’t have, and what the P30 offers, the S10e cannot give you.  Hence, some camera features are not comparable. But as I already said, the S10e is the better performer when it comes to regular point and shoot, but the P30 gives you a lot of options at your finger-tips.  Performance  Let’s discuss Performance next on Samsung Galaxy S10e vs Huawei P30 next. There’s not a lot to talk about it this regard, though. Both of them come with flagship processors – the  Exynos 9820 on the S10e  and  Kirin 980 on the P30 . And the performance on both is what you’d expect with flagships. They both fly through tasks, are super smooth and get things done without a hitch.     Tests  Huawei P30  Samsung Galaxy S10e    Geekbench 4  Single-core  3275  Multi-core  9795  Single-core  4378  Multi-core  9813    AnTuTu 7  291752  325888    Androbench  Sequential Read  823.69 MB/s  Sequential Write  193.47 MB/s  Sequential Read  787.02 MB/s  Sequential Write  194.06 MB/s     If we talk tests, however, the  S10e stands tall  with it decimating the scores on Geekbench 4 and AnTuTu scores. The P30 seems to have faster storage as shown by Androbench. But if you take a look at a speed test by Gary Explains, it’s the P30 that overpowers the S10e, because of the faster storage. Which is why… let’s not talk about them like these. After all, it’s the daily usage that matters.  And neither of them disappoint on that front. Both of them are zippy, and gaming goes without a hitch on any. I played as much PUBG on them, and both can run the game on ultra frame rates and HDR quality, without the slightest bit of stutter. Other games like Asphalt are a breeze as well, not to mention smaller games. However, the  S10e tends to heat quite a bit sometimes , but it doesn’t happen every time I game. There were instances when it heated for no reason even when it was inside my pocket.  The  S10e has a side mounted fingerprint scanner  while the P30 has the fancy  in-display one . However, the in-display scanner is still an Optic one, and not the Ultrasonic like on the S10 and S10+. Still, it’s as fast as the side-mounted sensor on the S10e. Of course, there will be some difference, but it’s not really noticeable. Face recognition, on both, is handled by the front camera, and are equally fast.  Software  Now, this is the one part that keeps me going back to the S10e. It’s  One UI is highly optimized , and just feels more user-friendly. The presence of an app-drawer is also another thing that I like. I like to keep my home screen clean, and that option is not there on the P30. It just makes for a cleaner user experience.      Huawei P30 UI   1  of 5               Home Page         Notification Shade         Quick Settings Toggle         Settings Menu         Multi-tasking                               Samsung Galaxy S10e Screenshots   1  of 7               Homecreen         Apps Edge         Apps Drawer         Multi-tasking         Notifications         Settings Toggle         Settings Menu                                 The P30’s  EMUI 9.1  is no slouch. It’s good too, and easy enough to use. The UI is so optimized that sometimes, you’ll feel it be faster than the S10e, despite the test scores. But there’s something about the One UI that makes me prefer that over this. Maybe it’s the boxy looking icons…but  One UI definitely seems better than EMUI 9.1 .  Battery  This, however, is a sensitive topic for the S10e. With a small  3100 mAh battery , the phone struggles to last a whole day between charges. You have to be quite skimpy while using the phone if you want to make it last until your bedtime. Power users need to carry their charger with them, and even for normal users, the phone’s battery life can disappoint. And so, even if it does have the Wireless Power Share, it doesn’t really make sense.  The P30 has a  bigger battery at 3650 mAh . But even for a not-so-big difference, the battery life is good on this one. It definitely lasts until your bedtime, and sometimes more. Maybe the reason is the software’s battery optimizer is very aggressive. It can freeze the apps in your background if not used for a while, but it does its job.  In addition, I also did a charging speed test. And guess who won? The  P30’s 22-Watt Fast Charger leaves the S10e’s 15-Watt Adaptive Charging in the dust! \xa0The S10e takes about 95 minutes to go from 0 to 100 while the P30 does it in about 75 minutes.  Conclusion  So, at the end of Samsung Galaxy S10e vs Huawei P30, there is no clear winner here. Not surprised? I wasn’t either. These two cannot be compared in all of the aspects. There’s always some kind of a trade-off between the features these two have to offer. S10e’s build quality is superior but the P30 looks better. Samsung’s new display technology is unbeatable, but the P30 does well in normal viewing.  On the performance front, it’s a mixed bag of scores, but in terms of normal usage, both did exceptionally well. And in camera performance, my view remains unchanged. Again…if you want that effortless point and shoot, the S10e is the one to pick, but if you want more features, the P30 is the way to go.   And as much of a difficult decision, it is to pick one between the two, I personally would pick the Huawei P30. There, you have it!  For me, the P30 is the better pick, mostly because of the battery life  while choosing its trade-offs. My perspective is that; I can get used to the slightly heavy software of the P30, but I can’t get used to the skimpy battery life on the S10e!  Also, when it comes to the camera, I tend to experiment with all those features at my disposal. Looking at the images from the S10e makes me want the same level of image quality and colors, but the trade-off is something I’m willing to make. Plus, the scores don’t matter to me as much as the regular performance does. As for the pricing, the S10e is slightly cheaper, but the slightly larger cost, I think, is justified, with the extra telephoto lens alone. So, yes, for me, it’s the P30 that I’ll pick over the S10e.  Of course, that is just my opinion. Yours might differ. Because the Galaxy S10e is a great semi-flagship, too. So, do let us know your thoughts on this.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/samsung-galaxy-s10e-vs-huawei-p30.jpg']
['Android Q – What to expect?'],['Android'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 8, 2019']",2019-05-08 11:03:05+00:00,"['While I have yet to receive an Android Pie update on my phone, the Android community is not really waiting around. It seems like yesterday Android Pie launched, but Android Q is already here. Right now, it’s still in its  Beta stages , but here are some major features that will make it in the final release of the Software.  All-Gesture Navigation  This might not come as a surprise for most. While other smartphones keep gestures as an option, the latest iteration of Android will make it the primary navigation feature. You’ll have to  say goodbye to the back button . That will be replaced by a tiny pill at the bottom of the screen. To go back, you have to swipe left or right from either side of the screen.  Source: 9to5Google  That is something we’ve already seen on other phones’ gesture navigations, though. So, it’s nothing new. Yet those who love the back button will have to make do. But of course, this is only for Stock Android. Other phone companies will have their own version of navigations, of course.        System-wide Dark Mode  Dark Mode is something that’s actually much sought after by phone users. It doesn’t sound like much, but having a dark theme on your phone can appear so cool! Of course, I don’t know about you guys, but I like it a lot…because that’s the closest I’ll get to being Batman!   Again, this is not an entirely new feature. Other phones do offer Dark themes in their own Operating Systems. But with Google doing it, now, this  dark theme will be supported throughout the apps as well . Of course, not all apps on your phone will do it, but it’ll start with Google Apps for now. So, yeah… you will be able to watch YouTube in black! How cool is that? In addition, you can turn it on / off easily through the Quick Settings toggle menu.  Live Caption  Ever been watching a video on your phone and wishing there were subtitles? It kinda happens to me a lot. Sometimes, it’s the video quality, while other times, there’s just too much noise around. But I have found myself wishing that I had subtitles on those videos quite a few times.   And now, with Android Q, you will have it. It’s called a Live Caption feature, and it can  provide real-time captions for just about anything  where someone is talking on the phone – which, of course, means mostly videos. But it can also work for voice recordings or messages. And the best part about this is that it happens locally on the device – no internet connection required.  This feat is made possible by Google’s Machine Learning which listens to the speech in real time and produces the closest subtitles. So, of course, it doesn’t mean a 100% accuracy or maybe not even multiple language support, but it’s a new step. It might be something along the lines of YouTube Auto-generated subtitles.  Permissions and Privacy  While most of us don’t give a second thought about why certain apps will ask for locations on our phone, it is actually a grave matter of privacy to many. And with privacy becoming a major concern over almost all social media and non-social media platforms, Android Q is also working to make it better.   At present, if some app wants permission to access our location, and we grant it, we have to turn it off by ourselves. But with Android Q, any app that asks for our location will also ask us if we want to grant it access all the time, never, or only when the app is open.\xa0In addition, the Permissions menu in the Settings is redesigned to reveal how many apps are using what kind of permissions, and enabling us to sort out the apps according to the permissions granted.  Quick Reply or Notification Action  This is another new feature that makes for more convenient phone usage.  When we get notifications, Android Q will ask you what you want to do with it . For example, when you get some kind of a message, you can long press on the notification itself, and it will greet you with some options to reply to it. What happens here, is the software is reading your message, and the AI will give you quick options to reply suitably to it.  In addition, if there is anything related to location, it will provide you an option to open Google Maps of that location as well. This, Google claims, will all happen locally, on your phone, and nothing gets shared. So, it also works when you have no internet connection.  Other Features  Besides these, Android Q packs a lot of other small features. For instance, Stock Android will get a  built-in Screen recording feature . This, of course, is already available in other Operating Systems like ColorsOS of Oppo, or EMUI of Huawei. But, this is, only now being made available in a system-wide fashion here.\xa0Other changes include  improved Share Menu , and  better support for Foldable phones  – because, after all, they seem to be the future.  Source: 9to5Google  So, these were about all the major features in coming in Android Q. The Operating System is now in its Beta 3 testing phase, so, there sure will be a lot of other features to come before it finally rolls out. But what I am most excited about Android Q is what it will be called. “Q” is a strange letter in the alphabet, isn’t it? And Android’s history of naming its OS after desserts, or sweet things, makes it all the more difficult. So, what do you think will the new name of Android Q be? Do let us know your thoughts.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/android-q.jpg']
['Google launches Pixel 3a and 3a XL: A camera-centric midrange devices from Google'],['Google Pixel'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 8, 2019']",2019-05-08 08:35:03+00:00,"['Source: CNet                  There have been several leaks and speculations regarding the  Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL . A midrange device with more or less the similar camera capabilities of the flagship Pixel 3 devices, well, that’s enough to get excited. And with the unadulterated version of the Android OS on the system, the phone surely deserved all sorts of attention. Although there were barely any new features left to reveal after the tremendous amounts of leaks, Google organized an I/O event and announced these devices.   Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL Overview  Since the Google Pixel devices always shine on the imaging department, let’s talk about its cameras first. Both the phones feature a single camera setup at the back, which uses a  12.2MP Sony IMX 363 sensor . It is the same sensor used on the flagship  Google Pixel 3 devices .        Source: Android Authority  In addition, these cameras also come with  Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)  and  Electronic Image stabilization (EIS) . Google has also generously added computational photography prowess in the device, which is almost in the same level of the flagship Pixel 3 devices. The Pixel 3 and 3a XL also comes with the Pixel 3 XL’s  Night Sight  and  portrait mode  prodigy.   On the front, however, the phone comes with a single selfie shooter. Pixel 3 and 3a XL sport an  8MP shooter  to capture the selfies. With the hardware like the flagship device, Google’s sales proposition goes as straightforward as saying, “This is the cheapest Pixel camera you can get.”  Talking about the display, the smaller one or the Pixel 3a comes with a  5.6-inch gOLED display  whereas the bigger one gets a  6-inch panel . Since we have never heard anything about the gOLED displays and Google didn’t divulge anything about it in the launch event, we suppose it to be a proprietary name for OLED screens in the Google Pixel devices. The display lacks any sort of notches or punch-hole cutouts. However, Google has incorporated thick bezels on the top and on the bottom, which looks rather antiquated. Nonetheless, Google has included  Dragontrail glass protection  on the top to prevent accidental damages during the falls.  Source: Android Central  On the performance part, the phone gets a midrange  Snapdragon 670 chipset . The chipset comes mated with  4GB of RAM  and  64GB of onboard memory . Sadly, there is  no SD card slot  on the phone. So expanding the storage is quite impossible. Also, the phone only comes in a 64GB variant, which is a bummer for the people who have to work with a large number of files on their phone.   Software-wise, the phone boots on  Android Pie  out of the box. Since the device is from Google itself, there won’t be any type of bloatware on the phone. Plus, Google also promises regular software update and security patches for a considerable amount of time. Talking about the battery, the smaller one boasts a  3000mAh battery  whereas the bigger one flaunts a decently big  3700mAh  one. The device comes wrapped inside a  dual-tone polycarbonate back  offering a strong resemblance with the flagship Pixel devices.

In India, the device has been priced at  INR 39,999  and  INR 44,999  for the 3a and 3a XL devices respectively.   The Pixel 3 and 3a XL are undoubtedly the best midrange camera phones. With their hardware setup and computational photography, they can even outdo some of the flagship devices in the market available right now. However, other than cameras then is nothing much to like about the phone. At almost half the price, there are more powerful devices like the  Realme 3 Pro  and the  Redmi Note 7 Pro . The Realme 3 Pro and Redmi Note 7 Pro also come with bigger displays, bigger battery and with an option to expand the storage. Although the Pixel 3a devices outweigh all of the midrange devices on the software front, it may not be an absolute deal breaker for the most.  Since Xiaomi is on the verge of launching a  Snapdragon 855 powered smartphone (maybe Pocophone F2)  and Realme is also striding to launch  Realme X (SD730 powered phone) , I guess it’s better to wait for those devices. Since Realme and Xiaomi have a history of pricing their smartphones aggressively, we hope Realme and Redmi offer better value for money than these Pixel devices. Apart from a powerful processor, the Realme and Redmi phones also usually come with better design and premium built, I think it’s worth the wait. Also, the upcoming  OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro  could be a better option at around a similar price (in India), which is launching on the 14 th  of May.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/google-pixel-3a-xl-launched.jpg']
['Huawei P30 and P30 Pro Review – Bringing out the big guns!'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 6, 2019']",2019-05-06 11:23:34+00:00,"['A few years ago, if anyone told me to buy a Huawei flagship phone, I’d be pretty skeptical. But now, if you think about the best phones money can buy – Huawei is right there somewhere at the top 3. Beating even Apple to the second biggest smartphone company, Huawei has done tremendous leaps and bounds when it comes to flagship phones. And the P30 Pro kinda proves it. The P30 Pro and the P30 are the phones that Huawei wanted to rewrite the rules of Photography with. And to do that, they certainly brought out the big guns!   Huawei P30 Pro and P30 Specifications:       P30 Pro  P30    Design  Glass body, aluminum frame  Glass body, aluminum frame    Display  6.47-inch OLED Full HD+ display, (1080 x 2340 pixels), HDR10+, water-drop notch  6.1-inch OLED Full HD+ display, (1080 x 2340 pixels), HDR10, water-drop notch    Rear Camera  Quad-camera setup, 40 MP Super Spectrum lens with f/1.6 + 20 MP ultra-wide with f/2.2 + 8 MP Periscope telephoto lens with f/2.2 (5X Optical Zoom) + 3D Time-Of-Flight Sensor  Triple-camera setup, 40 MP Super Spectrum lens with f/1.8 + 16 MP ultra-wide with f/2.2 + 8 MP telephoto lens with f/2.4 (3X Optical Zoom)    Front Camera  32 MP with f/2.0, wide, HDR  32 MP with f/2.0, wide, HDR    Chipset  Kirin 980  Kirin 980    GPU  Mali-G76 MP10  Mali-G76 MP10    RAM  8 GB  8 GB    Storage  128 / 256 / 512 GB  64 / 128 / 256 GB    Operating System  Android 9.0 Pie with EMUI 9.1  Android 9.0 Pie with EMUI 9.1    Color Options  Breathing Crystal, Aurora Blue  Breathing Crystal, Aurora Blue    Features  Fingerprint (under-display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, IR Blaster, Electromagnetic Levitation earpiece  Fingerprint (under-display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, 3.5 mm headphone jack    Battery  4200 mAh, 40-Watt SuperCharge  3650 mAh, 22-Watt Fast Charging    Price  €1099 (Rs.1,19,900)  €799 (Rs.84,900)      Design  I think it was Huawei who brought us dual-tone gradient color designs on smartphones, and while many others have adopted it, no one still does it better than Huawei themselves. Now, even when you think you’ve seen the design before, you have to agree that this looks stunning. Both the P30 and P30 Pro feature it, and while the Breathing Crystal color is what everyone talks about, I think you can’t go wrong with the good old Aurora Blue either.         Ergonomically, the P30, here, seems to be the better choice. It is small, compact and manageable in the hands. The P30 Pro has a lot more heft to it, and if you hold it alongside a  Galaxy S10 , it’s way heavier. Also, the P30 Pro has tapered sides and curved glass up front, which is prone to accidental touches and such. The P30 does not have that fancy design, but as I said, makes way for more practicability.      Huawei P30 and P30 Pro design   1  of 2               ports         IR Blaster                  In terms of design, we can see that Huawei is improving by generation. The P20 and  P20 Pro  weren’t very good to look at. But with the P30 series, they’ve done a good job. These two have quite a few differences. The most noticeable is the camera at the back –which we’ll get to later. Another is the  headphone jack at the bottom , which the P30 sacrifices. That’s a strange choice to make, but they did it anyway. Also, you  don’t get the IR Blaster on the P30 which the Pro has .  Plus (and this is a thing that goes mostly unnoticed), there is no earpiece on the P30 Pro. They embedded the speaker beneath the screen, and this is something called  Electromagnetic Levitation . And while the new tech sounds cool, and does make the Pro look cleaner, it seems a bit redundant. The call quality is no different between these two and I didn’t even notice the lack of an earpiece the first few days.  And while the P30 does have an earpiece, it doesn’t act as a secondary speaker. Both of these have only mono speakers at the bottom, but they are actually quite good. If you compare them with stereo speakers of the S10 series, they’re behind, but for what they are, they’re good enough.   The P30 Pro is also the one that gets the better build. While the  Pro is IP68 rated , the  P30 only has an IP53 rating  which keeps it safe from minor splashes only. The cameras protrude out slightly, on both, and are prone to damage. And by the way, there is no mention of any kind of protection on these phones. So, make sure to slap a case on them.  Display  While there were rumors surrounding the P30 series that they will use Samsung manufactured devices, it does not seem to be the case. Both these phones have  OLED displays  but support HDR 10+ content.   The P30 Pro has a larger  6.47” display  whereas the  P30 has a 6.1” display . Still, both have the  same resolution at Full HD+  and the same  dew-drop notch cutout . While these notches are small, and won’t affect your viewing experience all that much, this kind of feels cheap. Because, well, this kind of notches are found on all types of phones nowadays. And I feel like since these are top of the line phones, Huawei should have taken a different approach.  And while the  Mate 20 Pro  had a  QHD display , the P30 Pro doesn’t. I don’t expect the P30 to have one, but it was kinda expected on the Pro… To be honest, I don’t think a QHD is all that useful, though. I even turned it down on my S10, but the competition does have it, and they’re skipping it.  Anyway, the display still looks great! It’s vibrant, lively, and bright enough for outdoors as well. Of course, it’s not as good as the S10’s – they’re obviously the best in this regard. But if we’re making a list of top 5 displays, the P30 Pro might make it in the list somewhere. And what I like about this is that it has high brightness for outdoor usage as well as very low for using it in bed. The only disappointing this is that while the screen is scratch resistant glass, it’s  not Gorilla Glass  like on the S10.   Both of them also sport the  in-display fingerprint scanner . It’s an Optical scanner and not the Ultra-sonic one like that on the S10 and S10 Plus. But, these do a better job at unlocking your phone than those fancy ones. I felt these to be faster and they work 9 times out of 10, while on the S10, they worked only 7 times out of 10. So, you can say the in-display fingerprint has been greatly improved.  Battery  The battery life on both these phones is stellar. The  P30 Pro has a large 4200 mAh battery  while the  P30 has a good sized 3650 mAh . With regular usage, the P30 Pro lasts up to 2 days, and even with some heavy usage here and there, it will easily last you a day. The P30 might not last a full two days but does get close. Also, charging is pretty fast. The  P30 Pro has the 40 Watt Supercharge , which can fill up your phone in 58 minutes, while the  P30 only has a 22 Watt Fast Charging  that does the job in some 75 minutes.  Software and UI  This battery life is achieved, partly, by its well-optimized software.  EMUI 9.1  sees a bit of improvement over the EMUI 9. There’s a battery optimizer in there which is kind of aggressive and keeps reminding you if you have any kind of battery-intensive apps open in the background. Sometimes, it also closes apps in the background on its own.      Huawei P30 and P30 Pro UI   1  of 5               Home Page         Notification Shade         Quick Settings Toggle         Settings Menu         Multi-tasking                           Of course, there is some bloatware lying around. Many can be removed, but there is still a lot that stays. The UI is easy to use, and it’s user-friendly as well, but there’s something about Huawei’s UI that makes me feel like it needs a do-over. Maybe it’s the boxy looking icons or something, but the feeling is there.  Performance  However, the software well compliments the performance, which is fantastic. You get the  Kirin 980  chipset combined with  8 GB RAM  on both. And this chipset is indeed powerful. Now, if you go by the benchmark scores, the S10 series leave it in the water. Here are the benchmark scores:   Geekbench 4   Single-core:  3275  Multi-core:  9795    AnTuTu 7   291752    Androbench   Sequential Read:  823.69 MB/s  Sequential Write:  193.47 MB/s     But numbers don’t reveal the daily usage. And in those terms, I felt it doing as good as the S10. Gaming is pretty great, and multi-tasking is a breeze too. Actually, what it does better, even, is the loading of apps. The storage benchmark reveals that storage is faster on this one. And so, apps load slightly quicker on this one.  Speaking of storage, you get  128 GB as base storage  on both. But the one we get, here in Nepal, will come with 256 GB for the P30 Pro. Anyways, that is an ample amount of storage, but in the off-chance that you want more, you have no option other than to choose the  Nano-Memory card from Huawei . And I’d like to ask them, where is it? Because it’s not available as widely, actually, we don’t get that at all in Nepal, so…that is a bit of a problem. But the 128 GB will do it for most.  Camera  Now, the cameras are Huawei’s big guns. And the P30 and the P30 Pro also differ considerably in these terms. The P30 Pro packs a  quad-camera setup  at the back which comprises of a  40 MP Super Spectrum  primary lens, a  20 MP Ultra-wide lens , an  8 MP Periscope Telephoto lens  and a  3D Time of Flight sensor . On the other hand, the  P30 packs a triple camera set up \xa0at the back. It has the same 40 MP Super Spectrum primary lens, a 16 MP Ultra-wide lens and an 8 MP regular telephoto lens. However, the  Selfie camera is the same 32 MP on both .   Pictures from both of these are fantastic! The main lens, here, gets an  RYYB filter  instead of the regular RGB, which means it gathers more light, which makes for great low-light images. But otherwise, you get a bit cooler pictures and some have a yellowish tint to them. Still, the pictures are sharp, pack a lot of details and are just simply great!      Huawei P30 Pro & P30 regular camera samples   1  of 7                                                                                        By default, you take  10 MP pictures via  pixel binning , but you can shoot  RAW 40 MP pictures  as well. That won’t let you zoom in or out or such, and it doesn’t necessarily take better pictures. But the difference is visible when you zoom in for details after taking the pictures.      AI Mode   1  of 4               Normal          AI Mode         Normal         AI Mode                        Of course, there is the famous AI mode here, which amps up the colors and tweaks certain features based on its scene recognition. And while that may produce good results sometimes, it could be overwhelming at other times.      Huawei P30 Pro Camera Modes   1  of 5               Normal         Vivid Mode         Normal         Vivid Mode         Smooth Mode                           In addition, there are also these  camera modes – a Vivid mode, and a Smooth mode . The Vivid mode increases the intensity of the colors by a lot. And for some pictures, that looks too over-board. But, if you find the right settings, that can actually take some DSLR level shots. A bit of advice: Use it mostly for natural landscape shots, and not for others. The smooth mode here seems to be just a toned down level of Vivid mode.      P30 Pro Telephoto lens   1  of 7               1X zoom         5X Zoom         10X Zoom         1X Zoom         5X Zoom         10X Zoom         50X Zoom                                 The P30 Pro’s biggest weapon in its armory, is the Periscope Telephoto lens that offers up to  5X Optical Zoom, 10X Hybrid Zoom and up to 50X Digital Zooming . This lens has OIS, so, you still can take good stable images until 10X. The details are well preserved up to 5X, as it is, after all, Optical. And one of the benefits of this is if you want your subject closer, you don’t have to move forward – simply zoom in! As lazy as it sounds, it’s actually very handy. In good lighting, even 10X zooming gives you good pictures. But with a decrease in light, you will see slight muddiness in them. Anything after that is, well, not very useful, but it’s still fun to play around with. But I was still impressed with its ability to see major details after such zooming ordeals.      P30 Telephoto lens   1  of 9               Normal         3X Zoom         5X Zoom         Normal         3X Zoom         5X Zoom         10X Zoom         20X Zoom         30X Zoom                                       The P30, on the other hand, offers you only  3X Optical and 5X hybrid zoom , while it can go up to 30X digital. And as it is with the P30 Pro, images are sharp until 3X zoom, usable until 5X and anything after that requires very good lighting and ultra-steady hands. But some images are surprisingly good.      P30 Pro and P30 Ultra-wide   1  of 8               P30 Pro Regular         Ultra-wide         P30 Pro Regular         Ultra-wide         P30 Regular         Ultra-wide         P30 Regular         Ultra-wide                                    The Ultra-wide angle lens on both, is, more or less, the same. They pack a good amount of details, produce vivid colors, have good dynamic range, and are color accurate as well. Using this lens is mostly fun, and it comes in handy when you’re out there hiking or stuff. This lens is also useful for taking Super-Macro shots. But, one thing, which is easy to miss is there’s a separate  Super Macro mode  here for that… don’t just go about pointing the ultra-wide angle camera at objects…which, is what I did, at first!      P30 and P30 Pro Selfie Samples   1  of 6               Selfie                       Portrait Selfie                                            Selfies, too, are fantastic. There’s just a lot of details in there, and the selfie camera maintains better color tone than the primary. I like the selfie camera immensely for the details it packed, and even the portrait on the selfie camera is fantastic. The software does a great job of edge detection and offers quite a few background effects on portraits as well.      P30 Pro Portrait Samples   1  of 3                                                Speaking of portraits, the P30 Pro’s TOF sensor really does its job. The edge-detection has been greatly improved that what we saw on the Mate 20 Pro. It’s more consistent and is more accurate. The subject is well separated from the background, and it’s only a bit shy of DSLR quality portraits.      P30 Portrait   1  of 3                                                However, the P30 misses out on the TOF sensor. But nevertheless, its portrait images are great, too. Edge detection might take some hit, but otherwise, the software does a really good job. And like the selfies, you get quite a few background effects here as well.  In terms of videos, both the P30 devices can take  up to 4K videos at 30 fps . They’re stable and the video quality is really good. Colors are balanced, and the videos do well in most aspects. However, the rival S10 series can take 4K videos at 60 fps, so, this could be a weak spot for the P30 series.  Conclusion  So, to conclude, the Huawei P30 and the P30 Pro are fantastic top of the line phones. For me, I personally feel like the P30 is a better value for money, but for those who want all that smartphones cameras can give, the P30 Pro is the better choice.  Now, these phones might not have the best benchmark scores, but they deliver in terms of usage. The battery life and charging speeds are unmatched. And after playing with the cameras, overall, I’m beginning to favor the one of the P30 Pro rather than S10 – which was, by far, my favorite! Granted, the display is not the best we’ve seen, and the software is a bag of mixed feelings. But other than those two, Huawei has really nailed it with the P30 and the P30 Pro.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Huawei-P30-and-P30-Pro-review.jpg']

A tiny notch on the screen to get that edge-to-edge display. Then the  iPhone X  happened. And long story short, we’re now trying to get the most out of those screens. Be it by shrinking the notch to dew-drop styles, or employing a pop-up camera module, or punching a hole on the screen, we might have seen it all. But we all knew that the answer to the true bezel-less display was a camera under the display itself. It was only a matter of who would do it first. And Samsung stepped up!  Samsung, the Korean tech giant, confirmed that it has  an in-display camera in the works . The Korean media also confirmed this news. And so, it does look like we might be able to see a full-screen on a smartphone without any motorized parts or holes on the phone. However, this will only be the first step towards a full-screen display, as we might still have a long way to go.  Samsung’s Vice President for R&D, Yang Byung-Duk, put it this way “ Though it wouldn’t be possible to make a full-screen smartphone in the next 1-2 years, the technology can move forward to the point where the camera hole will be invisible, while not affecting the camera’s function in any way “.  Anyways, the tech behind it involves embedding all the camera sensors into the display without hindering the viewer experience. And as it stands, the camera might be visible while the selfie camera is an action. Also, it might have some similarity with the present in-display fingerprint sensors. But other than this, the company has not made any other details public.        So, what do you think? Will they really be able to pull it off? And is this full-screen display worth all this effort?

And the recently launched  Realme 3 Pro  is one of such devices to make a significant mark in the midrange territory. Along with the trendy features, Realme handsets also packs some powerful hardware on the inside. Since the smartphones with a high screen to body ratio is quite on the trend these days, Realme is also going with the flow and is on the verge of launching a notch-less and bezel-less smartphone in India. Dubbed as Realme X, a smartphone with the model number RMX1901 recently received BIS certification hinting an imminent launch in India.   The Realme X also recently went through TENAA, which revealed some of the key specs of the device. The major revelation that happened back then was the presence of the pop-up style selfie camera, which we saw on the  Oppo F11 Pro  and  Vivo V15 Pro . However, the resolution of the selfie snapper is still under the veil. Nonetheless, the reports suggest that there will be a dual camera setup at the back. The phone is said to embrace a 48MP main camera backed by a 5MP depth sensor. But it is yet to be confirmed whether the primary camera on this device would be a Sony IMX586 or Samsung’s ISOCELL GM1 sensor.        Performance has been the strong suit of Realme phones due to which they are leaving Redmi phones into trouble. The Realme X will come with the recently launched  Snapdragon 730 processor , which is supposed to go head to head against the yet unannounced  Redmi phone with the same chipset . The processor here will be mated with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. On the storage front, there will be two variants: 64GB and 128GB.   From the TENAA listing, we also found out that the device would feature a 6.5-inch Full-HD+ display. A sixth-gen optical fingerprint scanner is also said to reside underneath the display. This means that the display on this device will use an AMOLED panel. Rest of the rumors specs include the presence of a 3680mAh battery with support for VOOC 3.0 fast charging.  Reports suggest that the Realme X would launch in China on May 15 alongside the Realme 3 Pro. However, the Realme is said to launch the Realme 3 pro in its homeland as Realme X Lite.

['Samsung Galaxy A10 Review – Back to the basics!'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 5, 2019']",2019-05-05 07:06:15+00:00,"['When Samsung was revamping its budget and mid-range series, it received a ton of appreciation. And they kind of deserved it too. They came out with phones like  Galaxy M20 ,  Galaxy A50 , which were great in some markets. And in countries like ours, some of their phones are undisputedly the best in some price categories. But now, in a bid to give their consumers a lot of choices, Samsung is creating a confusing series of phones…again! The previous J-series was confusing, as it is. Now, the A-series is following the same footsteps. The A-series has a whole lot of phones –  A20 ,  A30 ,  A50 ,  A70 ,  A80 , and  A60 and A40s  in China, too. And today we have the Galaxy A10 – which is a budget phone. But I thought  M10  was supposed to be that. So what’s the real story? Let’s find that out in this Samsung Galaxy A10 Review.  Samsung Galaxy A10 Specifications:   Display:  6.2″ IPS LCD display with HD+ resolution (720 x 1520 pixels), Infinity-V notch, 19:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera:  Single, 13 MP with f/1.9 aperture  Front Camera:  5 MP with f/2.0 aperture  CPU:  Octa-core Exynos 7884  GPU:  Mali-G71 MP2  RAM:  2 GB  Storage:  32 GB internal, expandable via microSD card up to 512 GB  OS:  Android 9.0 (Pie) with One UI  Battery:  3,400 mAh  Colors:  Red, Blue, Black  Price:  Rs.14,190   Design  The A10 here is a bit more expensive than the Galaxy M10 and is a bit more toned up. Still, you can tell it’s your typical budget phone just by looking at its shiny plastic body. It does seem well-built but feels cheap in the hands. Of course, that is to be expected from a phone that costs so less.        1  of 3               Buttons         Charging Port         Glasstic Back                     There’s nothing worth mentioning about this phone, though. Nothing really stands out except from the awkward speaker placement at the back. That is a poor design choice in my opinion. Also, with a body such as this, it’s easy to get your finger smudges all over it .         Display  Upfront, its display is no hoot either. You get a standard HD+ display in an IPS LCD panel, but for the price, it’s okay.   Colors are slightly washed out, but it does have a warm tone all over at the same time. Also, the display can go from very low to very bright, but it’s not enough for good sunlight legibility.  There is an adaptive brightness feature but does not work that well. And turning it off just felt better.  Performance and Software  And talking about the performance, let’s just say it won’t let you down. It is smooth enough and it tries its best to run everything you throw at it.  The Exynos 7884 chipset is a lot better than what you get on the M10. Almost everything works…PUBG runs at medium settings with a bit of stutter here and there. At low settings, no such problems occur.   And Samsung’s One UI makes the experience a bit better. One UI, as we’ve talked quite a bit about, is more refined, faster and gives a user-friendly experience.  One thing I like about it, however, is, you still get 32 GB storage onboard. There’s also a dedicated microSD card slot to expand your memory.  The bottleneck, here, is the low 2GB RAM. And it hinders your user experience quite a bit. I mean, you should make sure that you turn off the notifications or alerts while gaming, because if you get a message on messenger while gaming, it cannot handle that! The Exynos 7884 would perform better if it had some more support.  Battery  Speaking of better support, Samsung could have also included a faster-charging feature on this one. It has a 5Watt charger included in the box which takes about 3 hours to charge. However, the 3400mAh battery does last you throughout the day, so, I stick to charging it overnight.  Camera  Now, all we are left to address is the camera on this device. But here, too, there’s nothing worth mentioning. This phone, has, only a single camera at the back which I feel is a step down from the M10 which had a dual camera, remember?   However, the camera is okay and slightly better than the M10. Under good lighting, it captures nice details. The color reproduction is average, there’s less noise and the sharpness are decent. Even so, it could use a bit more vibrancy, because sometimes, photos come a bit washed out. And it tends to lose focus easily while taking some time to focus on a subject.        1  of 19                                                                                                                        Low Light Sample         Low Light Sample         Low Light Sample         Low Light Sample                                                                     There’s also the 2X Digital zoom, which, just means regular zoom, and that’s pretty much useless. The same is with low light images. Photos are noisy, lacks sharpness, but at least, the images come out bright…so, there’s that!        1  of 8               Normal         2x Zoom         Normal         2x Zoom         Normal         2x Zoom         Normal         2x Zoom                                    And yes, there’s no portrait option in the camera app, which I think Samsung could have done with its software.   Selfies are also only just fine, and that is, under good lighting. Color reproduction is good, although, it could do with a bit more details. And under indoor light settings, the phone fails to capture good selfies. It is mostly blurry and lacks everything but noise.        1  of 5                                                                    However, you do get some fun stickers which are kind of fun. There’s also a beauty mode. But if I were you, I’d stay away from it.  For videos, the phone is capable of recording 1080p videos from both the front and back camera, and they’re usable. They’re not good, but not bad either, so…it’s just average.  For high res images,  Click here .  Extras  Talking about the extra’s, you get a Bluetooth 5.0 version. But you don’t get a 5 GHz WiFi support and also, no gyroscope. And since this is a budget phone, it also lacks a fingerprint sensor. But there is, a Facial Recognition, which I must say, is pretty slow. Also, it’s not that reliable. So, you’re stuck with the old school patterns and PINs.  Conclusion  So, what do I make of Galaxy A10? Well, I don’t know what to say. This phone is a better version of the M10. But it lacks the extra wide-angle camera which the M10 offered.  And while I think, a price of Rs.14, 190 or some US$130 is a bit too much to ask for some old-school features, there aren’t other offline oriented smartphone brands like Huawei or OPPO or VIVO who can give what Samsung is offering at this price point. So, if you are looking for a budget phone, you just can’t go wrong with the A10.  So is it better than the Redmi 7’s 2 GB variant? Actually, yes. Because both offer the same camera output and more, or less, similar performance. But the A10 offers more storage and a better design compared to the Redmi 7. So, yes.  Samsung Galaxy A10 Pros and Cons  Pros:   Display: Just overall a better viewing experience compared to the M10  Battery Life: Almost 2 days of normal usage under a single charge  Performance: One of the best performance you can get for the price  UI: A lot more refined, reliable, up to date and simple UI   Cons:   Charging time: Takes about 3 hours to fully charge  low RAM: Only 2GB RAM option, which is pretty insufficient by today’s standard  Adaptive brightness: No ambient light sensor']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/samsung-galaxy-a10-review.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy M40 spotted on Geekbench with SD675 and 6GB of RAM'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 5, 2019']",2019-05-05 02:43:29+00:00,"['Samsung commenced its budget and the mid-range lineup of smartphones for 2019 through the announcements of  Galaxy M10 ,  M20 , and  M30 . After that, the company focused on the A-series devices and announced almost a dozen of them. With so many smartphones already in the market in the first half of the year, we presumed Samsung is done releasing the smartphones for the year. But looking at the recent progression, Samsung does not seem to be on rest. A new Galaxy device recently appeared on Geekbench and the listing hints the device to be the Samsung Galaxy M40.  The new Galaxy device appeared on Geekbench with the model number SM-M405F. And looking at the naming convention of the Samsung smartphones, it is supposed to be the Galaxy M40. The listing also showed that the phone would have SD6150 processor, which is the code name for the Snapdragon 675 chipset. The phone will also have 6GB of RAM on the board. However, there is no information regarding other RAM variants of the device.         The Geekbench listing also shows that the Galaxy M40 will have the Android Pie on the software front. The software will be flavored by Samsung’s latest custom skin, the One UI on the top.  More details regarding the device are scanty but earlier speculations suggest that the phone will get 128GB of onboard memory. The recent naming convention of the Samsung devices cues that the M40 will be superior to the Galaxy M30. So the display on this device is expected to be bigger than the Galaxy M30. Nonetheless, it has been clearly mentioned that the device will come up with a Super AMOLED display with U-shaped notch on the top. Rumors also highlight that there will be a fingerprint scanner underneath the display.   On to the imaging part, the Samsung Galaxy M40 will have a triple camera setup on its back. However, there is no information regarding the resolution and type of lenses used. On the front, there will be a single selfie shooter residing on the notch. Reports also suggest that the phone will get a 5000mAh battery just like the M30.  A while back, a Samsung smartphone with the same model number was spotted on the websites of Bluetooth SIG and Wi-Fi Alliance. And the sudden listing on the Geekbench suggests that the new phone could make a debut really soon. Since Samsung is fiercely launching smartphones in quick succession, it won’t be a surprise if the South Korean giant unwraps the device next week.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-a70.jpg']

Oppo A1K Overview  Going by the specifications, we can firstly see a 6.1-inch IPS display, which comes with HD+ resolution. The display also comes with a tiny waterdrop style cutout on the top just like on the recently launched Oppo F11. Oppo A1k also flaunts Gorilla Glass 3 protection on the top, which protects the device from minor cracks and scratches during the falls.  Performance-wise, the phone gets the  MediaTek Helio P22  chipset, which comes along with  2GB  of RAM. In terms of storage, the phone enjoys  32GB  of onboard memory. The storage can be expanded up to 256GB and Oppo has included a dedicated slot for the purpose.        The major highlight on the device has to be its humongous battery. The phone flaunts a sizable  4000mAh . And owing to its low-res HD display, the device promises a prolonged endurance.   Moving on to the camera, there is a single shooter both on the front and on the back. The rear camera comes with an  8MP sensor  capped with an f/2.2 lens. A  5MP selfie shooter  rests on the notch up top. Apart from capturing selfies, the front shooter also comes into action while unlocking the device via Face Unlock feature.

['Huawei P30 Lite Review: P30 Legacy on a Budget!'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['May 2, 2019']",2019-05-02 15:53:24+00:00,"['It is really a nice concept of smartphone brands bringing a ‘lite version’ of their flagship devices. So, that makes those phones neither flagship nor they have mid-range specs entirely. Same is the case with the  Huawei P30 Lite . Some things it borrows from the high-end P-series and some from mid-range Nova phones. And it makes for a really interesting combination! But how much of the features has it borrowed from its flagship sibling? And does it really carry the legacy of the flagship P30? Let’s find that out in this Huawei P30 Lite review.   Huawei P30 Lite Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.15-inch IPS LCD display  Resolution:\xa0 Full-HD+ (2312×1080 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio @ 415PPI  Chipset:\xa0 HiSilicon Kirin 710  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU: \xa0Mali-G51 MP4  RAM:\xa0 6GB  Storage:\xa0 128GB; Expandable up to 512GB via SD card slot (Uses SIM2 Slot)  OS & UI:\xa0 Android Pie (v9.0) with EMUI 9 on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Triple camera – (24 MP, f/1.8, PDAF, wide-angle) + (8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, 120-degree field of view) + (2MP, f/2.4, depth sensor), LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 32MP, f/2.0  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 3340mAh non-removable Li-Po battery with 18W fast charging support; Uses USB Type-C  Colors:\xa0 White, Blue, Black  Price:  Rs. 39,999   Design         Let’s start the things with its design! The P30 Lite has a premium looking glass back with gradient finish just like all of Huawei’s phones in 2018! But I am not complaining, it looks really good. But since it has a glass body, it can be a bit slippery but, again, it’s kind of a trade-off you have with a glass body.  But I still like the design especially because it’s ergonomic. I really liked the  Galaxy S10  as it fits in my hands like it’s made for me and the P30 Lite gives me a similar feeling. And it has that right amount of heft to it and feels premium which, I think it has inherited from its flagship brothers.  I have used it without a cover because I like it that way and it has held up pretty well. Not major noticeable scratches have appeared. You get the phone with a screen protector already there, so Huawei has saved me the hassle of getting one.   Moving on, the buttons are placed in the right spot and you get that good tactile click on pressing them. The back of the phone looks minimal. While we are talking about the back, the fingerprint sensor is easily reachable and fast to my liking. So, I have to say that Huawei has done a pretty good job in the design aspect.  Display   Moving up front, the P30 Lite has a modest 6.1 inches display and I think it’s a good size. With all the phones growing to the size of tablets, this one’s a breath of fresh air. It’s an FHD+ screen that has enough brightness and good colors.  It’s an IPS LCD, so you won’t get those deep AMOLED blacks, but for a display this one is, you will have no complaints, I have had none.  Also, I am not known about Huawei including any gorilla glass protection on the screen though! So, do yourself a favor and slap on a protector on it.   Likewise, you cannot notice the notch on top. It’s a regular U-shaped notch with a speaker grill above it that has a tiny LED notification. It’s a bit dim, but I am just happy that it’s still there. You do have an option to hide it, but I guess I have finally accepted notches, so I used it like that. So, nothing to complain about the display either.  Camera   Now, the cameras. Don’t get me wrong when I said you get some flagship features in the P30 Lite, I was not talking about the cameras. Of course, we cannot expect P30’s cameras here! This one has what other mid-rangers offer at a similar price. It’s a triple camera setup consisting of a 24 MP primary camera, an 8 MP ultra-wide-angle lens and a 2MP depth sensor.  And judging by the pictures, it follows what other Huawei smartphones tend to do, oversaturate images a little bit! But that does not necessarily mean the images are bad. They look good. Take the below-attached samples as a reference. These pictures look good. And the pictures don’t miss out on details, they are sharp and on point!        1  of 10                                                                Wide Angle Mode                                                        And if you are wondering about the wide- angle pictures, here are some samples of it too. They have good colors and look vibrant. Of course, the primary sensor has managed to pack in a lot of details, but if you look closely, colors are better reproduced in the wide-angle shots.      Normal Vs Wide Angle Mode   1  of 14               Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode         Normal Mode         Wide Angle Mode                                                      Anyways, while we’re at it, let’s talk about portrait shots. Umm, they are not the best seen in a device of this price. The edge detection seems off and the blur is not very natural looking. Maybe Huawei should improve it by a software update. You also get different types of blurs, which are getting more popular on smartphones these days.        1  of 6                                                                              However, I used to ponder why there are two modes for portrait images, the aperture and the portrait mode. But it so happens that in pictures taken from the portrait mode you cannot change the depth of field and focus point but in the aperture mode, you can! Huawei could have included both in the same place as to make it simpler though.  Similarly, you get tones of camera features that need some serious digging in. They are not the most useful normally, but good to play with sometimes. However, what I liked is the night mode here. It’s not as good as the P30, but helps preserve details well and also makes the images brighter.      Huawei P30 Lite Night Mode   1  of 6               Night Mode Off         Night Mode On         Night Mode Off         Night Mode On         Night Mode Off         Night Mode On                              The AI mode is less aggressive than what we previously got on Huawei phones. However, it does oversaturate pictures like you can see in this flower, but in this image, the AI works really well.        1  of 6               AI Mode Turned Off         AI Mode Turned On         AI Mode Turned Off         AI Mode Turned On         AI Mode Turned Off         AI Mode Turned On                              Selfies, on the other hand, from the 32 MP camera are impressive. Although, not the most natural, but not bad either. They are colorful and bright and will not disappoint you in any way.   Portrait selfies are an outcome of software but good enough to like them overall. There are also various portrait lighting effects which are fun to play around with.  Also, I like to keep the beauty mode off all the times because I like my pictures to look natural. However, I have seen some of my friends to have a liking for it. So, here are some samples of beautified selfies I clicked to check how it works. Do, let me know in the comments below if you like it.      Different Selfie Modes   1  of 10               Normal Selfie         Normal Selfie         Normal Selfie         Normal Selfie         Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Beauty Mode Turned On         Beauty Mode Turned On                                          One thing I seriously love about the cameras is the videos it can take. The phone has Gyro- EIS that makes the videos very stable. You have options of shooting in different resolutions, but I suggest you do it in 1080p@30 fps for the best quality and stabilization. And if you are into vlogging on a budget, this one might be for you!  So, summing up the camera part, except for the portraits, you are getting a very good deal here!  For high res images,  Click here .  Performance  The P30 Lite runs on the same Kirin 710 chipset that we saw on last year’s Nova 3i and Honor 8X.\xa0 In a similar price range, you do get better chipset for sure. Just look at these benchmark scores we compared against similarly priced Galaxy A50 and Poco F1.  Seems like Huawei needs to bring another mid-range chipset to compete in this segment or they could have just given the Kirin 970.  Having said that, we know how that Kirin 710 performs, it’s not bad by any means. It can handle almost everything you throw at it from multitasking to high-end gaming. Although you won’t get to play PUBG in the highest of settings like the A50 or Poco F1, since the Nepali government has put a ban on it, there are very limited days of playing it anyways! I have tested playing Asphalt 9 too and it runs well so nothing major to worry about.  Here are some benchmark scores:   Geekbench 4:   Single-Core: 1526  Multi-core: 5346  Compute: 2596    AnTuTu:   127833    3DMark Sling Shot Extreme   OpenGL ES 3.1: 945  Vulka: 1354    PC Mark   Work Performance 2.0: 6532    AndroBench   Sequential Read: 292.39 MB/s  Sequential Write: 154.3 MB/s     So, if performance is your topmost priority, you do have an option to get the Pocophone F1, which is unbeatable for the price but if you feel your needs are not very comprehensive, the Kirin 710 will do just fine. Plus, you are getting 6GB of RAM and 128 GB storage inside, which is good to see on a midrange phone.  Software and UI   The phone runs on Android 9 Pie with EMUI 9.0.1. And I love how EMUI has evolved over the years. The experience is now smoother and better than before and I have very less problems with it. And I also like how Huawei lets users make customizations as per their liking which is good to have.  You do get a fair share of bloatware in it but most of them can be uninstalled, so no worries here. And although EMUI has its perks, One UI feels lighter and easier to operate.  And Huawei is getting better with updates these days, so think this one will receive Android Q update as well. Having said that, I haven’t received a system update on my use, just hope that it’s on the way! However, the latest security patch is dated February 2019!  Battery   The Huawei P30 Lite has a decent 3,340 mAh battery packed inside which is good enough. And as compact the phone is, the battery size does nothing but compliment to it.  Talking about the battery life, you get a day of use. And my usage is above an average person. It will give you 5 hours of screen on time with 2 hours of watching videos, an hour of gaming, and 2hours of social media.  And although the phone has a relatively smaller battery, you get an 18-watt fast charging adapter inside the box along with a Type-C cable. It takes around 1 hour 45 minutes to charge from 0 to 100%.  Extras:   Moving on to the extras, the single firing speaker at the bottom is a good one and is moderately loud. There’s a headphone jack too, which I am thankful to see.   But you have to sacrifice on a SIM slot to expand the memory if need be because this one has a hybrid SIM slot. Although 128 GB will be enough for most, I guess.  As already mentioned, the fingerprint sensor at the back is swift and gets it correct all the time, except for when your hands are greasy. The facial unlock is fast as well and is done by the primary camera so might not be the most secure!  Conclusion:  The Huawei P30 Lite seems to offer good stuff to the table overall. The main competition to it right now is the Galaxy A50 especially because of its superior AMOLED display and slightly better performance. But other than that, you are getting a very appealing design, more storage and an impressive set of cameras with the P30 Lite.  If you ask me, personally I have liked using the P30 Lite as my daily driver these last 2 weeks. And as I said earlier I love how it is a breath of fresh air in the world of large smartphones. So, buying the P30 Lite is not going to be a regret, that I can tell you for sure!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-p30-Lite-review.jpg']
['Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL leaks again: This time with the color options and price'],['Google Pixel'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 2, 2019']",2019-05-02 12:32:12+00:00,"['Ahead of the launch of  Google Pixel 3 and 3XL , there have been too much of leaks. And its midrange sibling is going through the same fate. The upcoming Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL are slated to launch on 7 th  of May. But a week ahead of its launch, there has been quite a big leak. And this recent leak has divulged the color options, storage variants and the price as well.  The renders came through  Droid-Life , which spilled the color options of the device. The renders show the Pixel 3a/3a XL devices in White, Purple, and Black color variants. And alongside that, there were some promotional images confirming some of the specs and features of the devices.      Color Options   1  of 3               Black         Purple         White                     The website primarily confirms that the smaller of the two will get a 5.6-inch display. And the Pixel 3a XL is said to come with the 6.0-inch panel. On the battery side, Pixel 3a will have a 3000mAh battery and the ‘XL’ variant will feature a 3700mAh one. Apart from that, both of these devices are said to come with similar features. Both of them will flaunt a 12.2MP Dual Pixel rear camera, an 8MP selfie shooter, which might be similar to what we saw on the flagship Pixel 3 Duo. Furthermore, these phones will support the infamous Night Sight mode in the camera app. These phones will also come aboard with portrait mode, Motion Auto Focus, and unlimited Google Photos storage.        Even on the midrange device, Google seems to be generous this time. Both of these devices will come with fast charging support, which is said to inject the power to in such a speed that it will back the device up for “7 hours with 15 minutes of charge”. Evidently, the phone will come with Android 9 Pie out of the box with a promise of security and OS upgrades for 3 years.  Additionally, the phone will come with 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard memory. But a new leak from a tech YouTube channel named “ This is Tech Today ” has highlighted that there will be 128GB storage options as well.   The YouTuber also went ahead with the information about the devices and revealed the prices of the devices as well. According to  This is Tech Today , the base variant of the Pixel 3a will cost $399. The ‘XL’ variant will be $80 more expensive than the smaller version at $479. The presenter, Brandon Lee also mentioned that there will be Snapdragon 670 chipset on the board. However, he did not quite explicitly say that it will be on Pixel 3a or 3a XL or both. Earlier leaks suggest that the 3a will have Snapdragon 670 and Snapdragon 710 on the  Google Pixel 3a XL . But we probably have to wait till May 7 for the official confirmation of the specifications.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/google-pixel-3a-xl-specs.jpg']
['Facebook Developer Conference 2019 – Facebook is changing for better or worse'],['Facebook'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 2, 2019']",2019-05-02 12:11:31+00:00,"['Facebook ‘s largest annual event, Facebook Developer Conference or Facebook F8 2019 went by. And this year, they had quite a lot of announcements to make. To sum it all up, Facebook is changing – for better, or worse! Some changes might be welcome, while some…we’ll take some time getting used to. So, here are some of the announcements that matter in the event.  “The Future is Private”\xa0 or is it?   For a company that people, these days, look upon with distrust, this is a bold announcement to make. From the  Cambridge Analytica  scandal to other frequent  allegations  related to privacy, the company is not really doing well in the privacy department. But, Mark Zuckerberg seems to know all about it. He claimed that things were going to change.        Facebook will be making major changes in its policies. The social media platform will, apparently, now be more privacy-focused and secure service. It will highlight  6 major components  – private interactions, encryption, reduced permanence, safety, interoperability, and secure data storage. The company is also going lengths to provide end to end encryption to Messenger’s, Instagram’s and WhatsApp’s video and audio calls. However, this version of Facebook won’t roll out soon…could take almost a year.  Facebook gets a make-over   This might be a mixed bag of emotions for some. The Facebook we’ve come to use and, maybe love, will soon be no more. It’s getting a massive redesign – both in the desktop browser version and the mobile app. It will be a more “cleaner” design, with the layout having a more white look. But it will have a dark mode too.  The “cleaner” look means not only the color but your News Feed will take a hit, too. The new Facebook, or, FB5, will  emphasize more on Groups and Events  and less on the News Feed. This is supposed to help people expand their social circles. I, for one, don’t really like this approach (not a social butterfly), but some might like it, though.  Messenger at Lightspeed!   For a messaging app, Facebook’s messenger seems a bit too, heavy, doesn’t it? And you’ll notice it more so when you’re maybe playing a heavy game, and a message pops up. Then, your phone will become somewhat unresponsive for a second. It’s not the same for all phones, but many struggle. And so, the company is taking steps to re-build the messenger app entirely, so that it’s  size is reduced to less than 30 MB ! This means the app will open and run faster.  Also, a  standalone desktop Messenger app  is in the works. So, if you don’t want to open Facebook on your browser every time you want to check your messages, this is good news. But you can also use the Opera Browser, with messenger built in! (Just saying!)  Another addition to the messenger app is that you can also directly interact with your “Close Friends”. This feature will be there, both on Messenger and Instagram, but it’s not yet clear how it’ll work exactly. But the idea is similar to that we have on Instagram, share your status messages and such in a more private and tighter friend circle.  Instagram Camera Redesign and new Mode   Instagram stories are one of the most used features of the app. But Instagram’s own camera is not as good as your real one. Granted, it won’t ever be…but the company’s trying to improve the camera on it so that you can improve the quality of your stories and posts.  Also, the camera redesign means the filters and camera modes appear in a wheel, making it easier to navigate and look for. There will also be dedicated buttons for broadcasting and such. In addition, there’ll be a new  Create Mode\xa0 which will allow users to create posts without adding images or videos to it.  Furthermore, they’re adding  Shopping Tags\xa0 feature which enables influencers to add tags related to various products on their posts. And people can click on the tags to directly buy the products if they like it. This feature is only open to influencers like artists, athletes, creators, publishers, and other public figures.  Facebook Dating enhanced  Facebook’s online dating feature – Facebook Dating, introduced last year, is seeing some upgrades. Now, it has a feature called “ Secret Crush “, which allows you to create a secret list of friends you have a crush on. And if your crush thinks the same of you, and has you on their list, you’ll match! So, dating is more within your circle now…  Unfortunately, this is not available everywhere. This feature is now extended to 14 more countries, bringing the total to 19. It’s a shame this feature is not available here… I sure could use it!  Other Features  Besides these, there were a lot of other announcements made at the event.   In summary, Facebook is also trying to compete with Amazon – by improving its marketplace. It will be adding buying and shipping features allowing users to purchase goods directly from Facebook. But that feature is only in the U.S. right now.  Facebook’s online video calling through smart displays service,  Portal , has been available in the U.S. since launch. And now, it will also be available internationally. The Smart Displays will also support WhatsApp calling with end-to-end encryption as well.  In addition, Facebook also launched two new products – two new VR headsets –  Oculus Quest  and  Oculus Rift S . These headsets will both go for sale starting May 21, will ship to 22 different countries for some $400 each!  Apart from all these, Facebook is also improving it’s AI and machine learning to  recognize Hate Speech  and effectively filter them out. It’s a nice step from the company to minimize online bullying and shaming. Furthermore, Facebook is also training it’s AI to recognize images of things – i.e. it might soon be able to tell if you’re selling marijuana or vegetables using its services. The only problem with that is it might also be able to recognize you almost instantly. So much for privacy, right?  So, that was all the major stuff the social media giant announced at this year’s Facebook F8 2019. Yes, Facebook is changing, for better or worse. While some features mentioned above might not make it to our country just yet, it will soon be there. What do you think about these? Do let us know.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Facebook-F8.jpg']
['Full specs sheet of the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro are out'],['OnePlus'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 2, 2019']",2019-05-02 10:40:03+00:00,"['OnePlus’s upcoming flagship phones,  OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro are launching on May 14 . DisplayMate also said that the  OnePlus 7 Pro would have one of the best displays  on any smartphones out there. Apart from that, most of the specs were under the veil. But thanks to the leakers, some of the major specs of the device have recently come into the limelight ahead of its launch.  OnePlus 7 specifications (Leaked)  The leaks went far ahead so we now have the exact dimension of the device as well. The phone measures 157.7 x 74.8 x 8.1mm. So the device will have a similar form factor of the  OnePlus 6T . However, this time the phone will get a 6.2-inch display. So we can expect a slight increase in the size of the bezel. The phone will bring the reminiscence of the 6T, as it will have a tiny water-drop style notch on the top. The screen here will have Full-HD+ resolution and 60Hz refresh rate. OnePlus 7 will also have a fingerprint scanner under the display.         As expected, the phone will get the latest Snapdragon 855 chipset with 6GB of RAM. On the software front, OnePlus 7 will flaunt Android Pie (v9) out of the box with its custom skin OxygenOS on the top. One of the major highlights on this device will be its big battery. While the major smartphone players like Samsung and Huawei are being parsimonious on the battery front on the lower flagship variant, OnePlus went all out and provided a sizable 4150mAh battery on the standard OnePlus 7. Plus, the phone will have 30-watt Warp Charge technology to refill the battery really fast.  Higher megapixel count in the smartphone cameras is being the new trend of 2019. And like most of the Chinese phones, the OnePlus 7 will also come with a 48MP primary camera. However, the leak hasn’t specified the type of lens and resolution of secondary camera. Likewise, we do not yet know the resolution of the front camera. But as far as the rumors go, the front camera will reside on the notch.  The leaks went further unveiling the price of the device. Giztop, a Chinese e-commerce website has listed the OnePlus 7 in its website with the  price tag of $569 . If the phone launches at this price, there are high chances that the device will clench the title of the best flagship killer once again.  OnePlus 7 Pro specifications (Leaked)  Measuring at 162.6 x 76 x 8.8mm, the Pro variant will be slightly bigger and thicker when it comes to the size. Unlike the regular OnePlus 7, the Pro variant gets 6.64-inch notch-less AMOLED display, which refreshes at 90Hz. OnePlus has also upped its game this time by including Quad-HD+ resolution, which is quite an upgrade over the Full-HD+ resolution on the OnePlus 6T. With curvy edges on the sides, the display on this device will house a fingerprint scanner underneath it.   On the camera front, OnePlus has segregated the pro version from normal one by including an extra camera on the back. That means, just like the  Samsung Galaxy S10/S10+  and  Huawei P30 , the OnePlus 7 Pro will come with camera triplets on the back. The primary 48MP shooter will be accompanied by an ultra-wide-angle camera and a telephoto camera. On the front, the phone will have a pop-up style selfie camera just like the  Vivo V15 Pro  and  Oppo F11 Pro . However, there is no information regarding its resolution.   Powering the device will be snapdragon 855 with 8GB of RAM. The device is also expected to come with 10GB of RAM and we have seen benchmark leaks of the device with 12GB RAM. So we can expect three variants of the device in terms of RAM amount. The Pro version will get a slightly smaller 4000mAh battery and like the regular one, it will have support for 30-watt Warp Charging.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/oneplus-7-oneplus-7-pro.jpg']
['MSI PS42 Modern 8RA Review – A regular ultrabook…but from MSI!'],"['MSI', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['May 2, 2019']",2019-05-02 07:06:31+00:00,"['When you see a dragon logo on a laptop, it’s mostly meant for hard-core gaming. But this one, with the same kind of dragon logo ventures quite a different territory. MSI is a household name when it comes to gaming, and it’s not been very long since the company charted to the ultra-book territory. This is a line that’s mostly dominated by the likes of Apple and  Dell XPS , or HP and stuff. But they have their Prestige lineup comprises of ultra-books, and there are quite a few laptops in there now. Among them, the  MSI PS42 Modern 8RA   is the latest – a refreshment to last year’s PS42 8RB.   MSI PS42 Modern 8RA Specifications:   Design : Aluminum body, brushed metal texture, subtle white Dragon logo on the lid, 1.2 kg  Display : 14″ Full-HD matte display (1920 x 1080), 72% NTSC Color Gamut  Keyboard : Island-style full-size keyboard, 4-level back-lighting, No num-pad  Trackpad : Glass surface trackpad, Windows Precision Drivers, Fingerprint sensor with Windows Hello  Ports : 2 x Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 1, 2 x Type-A USB 3.1, 1 x HDMI, 1 x audio jack, 1 x SD card reader  Wireless connectivity : 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth V4.2  Processor : 1.8 GHz 8 th -gen Intel i7-8565U WhiskeyLake  RAM:  16 GB DDR4 @ 2400 MHz (single channel, dual slot)  Graphics : NVIDIA MX250 graphics, 2 GB VRAM  Battery : 4-cell 50 Watt-hour  Storage : 512 GB NVMe SSD  Price : Rs.149,000    Buy Here  Design         This laptop really gives a good first impression. Packed in a very sleek and compact box, it’s very different from what we’re used to seeing from MSI. But of course, it doesn’t really stand out from other ultra-books. Still, the fact that this one is an MSI ultra-book is enough excitement.   With an all-metal build and a subtle white MSI logo up top, it looks like your typical ultra-book too. Except that this one looks somewhat more elegant and classier. Maybe it’s the brash look or the brushed texture on the outer aluminum lid, or even the color, I can’t really say. But it just looks kinda different from other such ultraportables. Also, the brushed metal texture on it doesn’t really attract fingerprints, which is another plus for this laptop.  This laptop also weighs very less, about  1.2 kg , and is pretty comfortable to carry around. Build quality, though, takes a slight hit. The keyboard deck area is pretty sturdy, but the lid flexes quite a bit.   The back has air vents on each side, so even if this is an ultrabook, they did consider including a good cooling system. And yes, it does have dual fans inside that does the job well.   When you open the laptop, the first thing you’ll notice is this vent or grills up top that surrounds the circular power button, that appears to be the speakers. I, too, mistook it for the speaker, but they’re actually located underneath on both sides. This just seems to be some kind of an air vent, or a strange design choice, hard to tell which.  Ports and Connectivity  The port selection is, pretty standard. You get  two USB As , an  HDMI , an  audio jack , and an  SD card slot . What’s noteworthy is you get two USB-Cs. But it’s a shame that none of them supports Thunderbolt 3 or can be used to charge the laptop with. However, there are these LED indicators for battery, WiFi and power.      MSI PS42 Modern 8RA Ports   1  of 2               Left         Right                  As for WiFi, you get the standard  802.11 ac WiFi , and there’s  Bluetooth 4.2 .  Keyboard and Trackpad  Being an ultrabook, this laptop misses out on the number pad. But otherwise, you have a full-sized keyboard. Of course, I mean that in the sense the keys are larger and well-spaced than some other ultrabooks. The keys, however, are a bit mushy for taste, and with very  less key travel (0.9 mm) , typing doesn’t feel very good. But since the keys do give off that clicky feedback, it makes up for some of its shortcomings.   But one good thing is that you get full-sized arrow keys, which are rare for ultra-books. Another good thing is the backlighting. It’s only white, but there are 4-levels to it, and so, this helps immensely. However, this is not a new feature by any means.   The trackpad, here, too small for taste. And that is made even smaller by the curved edges of the top. There just isn’t enough room to move around. The only good thing about this is that it has Windows Precision Drivers, so tracking and gestures are fairly accurate. Plus, you do get a fingerprint scanner, which is a nice addition. And that works pretty well, too.  Display  The Prestige lineup boasts about good displays. And upon first look, it does appear so. There are minimal bezels around the sides, making the display almost edge to edge. But with small bezels comes the awkwardly placed web-cam, which points straight to your nose. And as usual, the webcam quality is nothing to go on about.   Anyways, back to the display, the  Full HD panel  looks good. I mean, with the  IPS LCD , it is your de-facto display for ultra-books and does not look anything extraordinary, but it is good nonetheless. Brightness is good enough at about  300 nits , and dark scenes in movies (for instance, Game Of Thrones Season 8 Episode 3) are visible enough that you don’t have to squint to see them.  And since it’s a  matte display , it’s pretty visible outdoors too. The  14-inch display  has enough crispiness for good video and multimedia experience, and the color range is also another plus point about the display here.  With an acclaimed  100% sRGB  and about  72% NTSC Color Gamut Coverage , this can be a suitable machine for content creators as well. But of course, this is not the most ideal laptop for that. You get other laptops with much more color accuracy than this one. Still, this, for an ultra-book is pretty good. And since it enables you to change the color modes right from the desktop itself, that’s another plus point.  Performance  The MSI PS42 Modern 8RA is a great performer. It packs the latest  8 th -gen Intel i7-8565U Whiskey Lake processor . And these new Whiskey Lake processors are capable of getting more performance on demand. The base clock remains the same about  1.8 GHz  but the  boost clocks can go up to 4.6 GHz,\xa0 which is actually higher than some other gaming laptops can go.  And that, apparently, helps during heavy workloads. However, all of that is on paper. In real usage, I never felt a lot of difference. Also, even though this is a U-series processor, made for power efficiency, it seems to handle everything fine. Light 1080P Video editing and stuff run quite well, while a whole lotta tabs on Google Chrome is also not enough to slow it down. There are slight instances of lags, here and there, but that is nothing beyond expectations.  Maybe it’s partly due to its  16 GB DDR4 RAM  – which is quite a good amount for an ultra-book. Also, it’s got  two RAM slots  but only a single stick inside, so, if you want to upgrade it, you can. But, again, if they had made it a dual channel with 8GB RAM on each slot, that would’ve offered better performance.  A dedicated graphics card helps gaming and video editing. It’s nothing high end – just an  Nvidia MX250 graphics  with 2 GB Video Memory. And when I say gaming, do not expect anything high end. You’ll be able to play CS: GO or Dota 2 or FIFA 19 on high settings and still get good frame rates. Games like Fortnite do run at medium and you’ll be able to play games like Assassin’s Creed Unity, but that’s about it. But even so, this is actually good enough for a non-gaming laptop.  Storage wise, you have a  512 GB of NVMe SSD , which is pretty good. Most ultra-books shy out at 256 GB. However, this doesn’t, and that helps a lot for content creation. The storage speeds are also decent enough, so, yes, these are the makings of a laptop for content creators.  I didn’t really feel this laptop struggle in the thermals department, either. During gaming and heavy workloads, it does kinda get warm, but heat management is really good – thanks to the dual fans and this ventilation on top. When it does get hot, it is concentrated towards the top vents, so, the keyboard area remains cool enough.  Battery  \xad\xad\xad\xad\xadMoving on to the battery, you get a  4-cell 50 Watt-hour battery , and they claim up to 10 hours of battery life. However, as these claims by laptop companies go, this is not true at all. During office workloads, when your usage consists of normal spreadsheet and occasional web browsing, it will last  slightly over 7.5 hours .   With vigorous browsing and media consumption, you’ll get close to 6. And if you’re doing some heavy editing and stuff, expect no more than 3 hours. But still, it will last a typical work day for you, so, that’s still good enough.  Conclusion  To sum up, MSI’s venture into ultrabook territory looks somewhat promising. With this PS42 Modern 8RA, it has improved from the 8RB. Yet, there is a lot of room for improvements. The build quality still needs work, while the keyboard and trackpad need to see improvements as well. I’d like this laptop better if it had a dual channel RAM. And the speaker quality needs more improvement than anything else.   Good things about it include performance, display, battery life, and overall design. So, you can say this is a pretty good laptop. Maybe, I had high expectations from this one, because, it’s an MSI laptop after all. But after using it, all I can say is MSI has not done as good a job as it does with its gaming rigs. But, I’m still positive that MSI will improve in this sector as well.  The MSI PS42 Modern 8RA is priced at some  $1300 for the base model , which comes with 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage. There are quite a few configurations available, so, prices are set accordingly. Our particular model costs about  Rs.149000  in Nepal, and as far as ultrabooks go, this one seems priced well enough.  However, if this is too much money to spend, there’s also a smaller sibling – the  PS42 Modern 8 MO . That one doesn’t have a dedicated GPU and is an i5 model. But most of the things remain the same. And that comes at a price of  Rs.115,000 .  So, strictly speaking, the MSI PS42 Modern 8RA is not the best one out there. But it certainly gets the work done.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/msi-ps42-modern-8ra-review.jpg']

['Samsung Galaxy A20 Review: Samsung’s New A-Lister?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 30, 2019']",2019-04-30 12:35:02+00:00,"['If you don’t know by now, Samsung is in line to create a football team of its own. No, it’s not for the Premier League or any other league. It’s a team to tackle the likes of  Redmi ,  Realme , and  Honor . Up until last year, Samsung was constantly criticized for its lack of answer to the budget-oriented Chinese brands, however, 2019 seems to be its year, as the Korean giants have already come up with quite a lot of ‘winners’. Hoping to clinch that same title is the Galaxy A20, a budget phone, that costs Rs. 20,500 in Nepal.   Samsung Galaxy A20 Specifications   Display:  6.4-inch (1560 × 720 pixels) HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-V display  Processor:  Octa-Core Exynos 7884 (Dual 1.6 GHz + Hexa 1.35 GHz) processor  RAM:  3GB  Storage:  32GB, expandable up to 512GB via micro SD card  OS:  Android 9.0 (Pie) with Samsung One UI  Rear Camera:  13MP\xa0 with LED flash, f/1.9 aperture, 5MP secondary camera with f/2.2 aperture  Front Camera:  8MP, f/2.0 aperture  Dimension:  158.4 x 74.7 x 7.8mm  Others:  3.5mm audio jack, FM Radio,\xa0fingerprint sensor  Connectivity:  Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 5, GPS + GLONASS  Battery:  4,000mAh  Price:  Rs. 20,500   Design  Now from the time I have been holding the Galaxy A20, I have always wanted to talk about its feel on hands. Yes, this is built from plastic. And well, if you still think budget phones cut cost on the build quality, think again.        This phone is light, yet is sturdy, I didn’t bend it like Jack from JerryRig would, but still, it can definitely take a hit! There is no hollow feel, you know, the one that a couple of devices have. It’s not glass like the one on its closest competitor the  Redmi Note 7 , but it still holds its own ground.   However, the back material catches a lot of fingerprints. Even the blue colored A20 I reviewed is quite a magnet. You will definitely need to carry a cloth to clean it as Samsung hasn’t included a case inside the box. And that has added in another problem, as I didn’t invest in a case. This glastic body is prone to scratches. Even when I kept the phone nowhere near keys or any hard objects, the back has developed a lot, a lot of scratches.  Display  Let’s talk about the display now. The Samsung Galaxy A20 has a tall 6.4-inch display bordering a small v-shaped notch on the top. This display is a Super AMOLED panel and the bezels aren’t that pronounced as well. While all of this is impressive and everything, the thing that Samsung hasn’t included here is full HD resolution. But with the Super AMOLED panel, that hasn’t really been an issue at all.   Apart from the issue of searching for that perfect sharpness while viewing videos or reading articles, this display is quite bright and quite colorful. The default wallpaper looks great and I haven’t yet changed it. Weird, I know.  Software and UI  What you will use most on the Samsung Galaxy A20 are the customizations the software offers. While the  Galaxy M10  and  M20  came with the older Android Oreo out of the box, the A20 runs on Pie with Samsung’s kind of new One UI on top. I recently reviewed the  Galaxy S10 , and the A20 has almost the same software experience as the flagship.   Although Samsung has the double tap to wake, I still think it has to include double tap to lock. I know, I’m nitpicking. What’s nice is the 100 GB of storage you get with OneDrive. The Microsoft apps obviously can’t be uninstalled, but I think I will take that for the extra cloud storage.  If this was a few years ago, reviewing a budget phone meant bashing about the software from Samsung. However, that has changed a little. The One UI, as I said, is light, but still, the apps take a little bit of time to open and the scrolling could have been a lot smoother on the phone.  Performance  The raw performance on the Galaxy A20 is smooth. The phone has the Exynos 7884 chipset inside. This is the mini version of the Exynos 7885 chipset that was used in a few Samsung phones like the  Galaxy A8+  last year. And like its elder brother, it is a capable processor.  Even gaming on it is not that bad. I played PUBG on a medium setting, and there is only a couple of instances of lags on a single game. Once, a match did start with lags here and there, but once I got to the game, there were one or two minor stutters.   Also, while we are talking about performance, just like the  A30 , this device too has the messenger issue while gaming. If you’re playing something and you get a text message, the whole thing just slows down.  Except for these issues, there aren’t any. The RAM management is good, as I have had no issues with running 6-7 applications at the same time.  But still, for similar pricing, you get the Redmi Note 7 with a more powerful SD660 which is around 1.5 times better in terms of performance than what the A20 offers. So, if you are after performance, I won’t wait for the conclusion part to say this, the Redmi Note 7 is better than the A20, and if you are into performance, get the former!  Camera   The front-facing camera on the Galaxy A20 rests on the water drop notch up front. It measures 8-megapixel, and if we talk about the selfies, well they look great, that is if you don’t zoom into them as the photos will lose a lot of details. But still, the overall color is great and not overpowering.        1  of 3                                                If you are in a bright area indoors, the selfies are good too but say the light isn’t that bright, then the above photo is what you get.  The front camera is also capable of capturing portrait selfies. It’s all the software that’s doing the work, and it isn’t doing that work well. The blurring is not on point, so I stayed away from the live focus of the selfie camera.        1  of 3                                                Let’s talk about the rear cameras now. Like the M20 and A30, you get dual cameras: A 13MP primary lens and a 5MP wide-angle lens.  The best use of the camera, at least for me, has been while capturing wide shots from the smallest of the angles and to capture the scenery. The colors we get here is accurate when compared to the primary camera.        1  of 4                                                          Talking about the primary camera, the first thing you will notice is that it lacks details. The colors are great and everything but it lacks sufficient details. And if you take pictures that have bright colors, you will notice oversaturation. Samsung and oversaturation go a long way and it’s no different this time too.        1  of 4                                                          The images also are not that good in terms of dynamic range. But I do like how the photos are brightened up a little bit making the whole thing pop.        1  of 2                                      Like the front camera, the rear camera also does software blur. And just like the front camera, the background blur is not that good, as the cutouts look unnatural. It misses the strands of the hair of the subject too. The same goes for the portraits shot on indoor lighting.        1  of 2                                      However, one thing that bugged me with this phone is that the live focus mode has only worked on people. Anything else, it just shows up a tab with Finding Face written on it.  During night time, the photos have a lot of noise on them. You will also notice grains. While the day time shots have a warmer color tone to them, the night shots have a colder tone. And they are exposed if there is a source of light hitting on them. The shots also lack details, just like during day time but the saturation makes the photos pop if there are shades of colors on them.        1  of 3                                                And finally, the videos. This device shoots full HD videos at 30 fps. And those videos are a bit wobbly as they lack any kind of stabilization. The colors are natural though.  Security   For security purpose, the Samsung Galaxy A20 has both the fingerprint and face unlock option. The fingerprint sensor is placed on the back of the phone and it is easily reachable. With the screen locked, the phone unlocks in around one second. However, with the screen on, the sensor can unlock the device in a snap. I have seen this issue on a couple of other devices too, and I think Samsung can improve this with a software update. For Face unlock, the A20 uses its front-facing camera. The option works great but takes a bit of time.  Extras   On the bottom of the phone lies a headphone jack along with the speaker grill. The sound from this mono speaker is clear but it’s not very loud. For storage purpose, the Galaxy A20 packs 32 GB of internal memory with an option to expand it via a dedicated microSD card slot.  Battery  The best part about this phone right here is its battery. The A20 has a large 4,000 mAh battery inside which has become a trademark on almost all the Samsung phones. At the very first, I talked about the A20 sporting HD display. And that couples well with the battery.   In my use of gaming for a while, watching videos on Youtube, going through a lot of websites, and using social media applications, I got a screen on time of around 6 hours and 30 minutes. How does that reflect on real life and the real day? Well, if you are a heavy user, who does a lot of things on their phone, the A20 will last you for a day, and if you are a moderate user who doesn’t do heavy tasks and doesn’t play games constantly, the phone will run for a day and a half easily. So, in terms of battery life, Samsung has definitely a winner on the Galaxy A20.  This battery takes around 1 hour and 40 minutes to go from 0 to 100% with its included 15W fast charger.  Conclusion  The Samsung Galaxy A20 is a member of Samsung’s huge lineup of the A-series. While it is more budget oriented, the device is definitely good at doing what it does although Samsung has cut a couple of corners for that. But still, it has a sturdy build and a vibrant display. The battery life is great and the camera, for that price is quite decent.  However, if we talk about performance, if you can add some money, you get the Redmi Note 7 which definitely performs better than the A20. So, if you are performance-centric users, you might want to take a look at that phone, otherwise, the A20 will handle your day-to-day usage quite easily.      Pros  Cons    – Good build quality  – Performance could be better    – Vibrant display  – Glastic back scratches easily    – Great battery life  – Lack of details on photos']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-A20-Review.jpg']

Fancy design, new and trendy technology and the best in class performance, that’s been on the OnePlus devices since its first phone. But apart from that, the Chinese smartphone maker also maintained its pace on improving other internals. Last few years, we saw some significant improvements in the camera front. Now seems like the company is taking a new leap on the display front. The phone just got the DisplayMate’s highest-ever A+ rating.  DisplayMate is the popular benchmarking platform, which tests the display of digital devices like TVs, Projectors, and smartphones. And this benchmarking platform recently announced that the yet unreleased OnePlus 7 Pro earned the ‘A+’ rating, which is the highest-ever rating DisplayMate provides. However, the benchmarking platform has not yet published the in-depth display shoot, which describes the attributes of the display used on the phone. Nonetheless, DisplayMate has promised to release it on May 14, the day  when the phone is supposed to get official .

But DisplayMate is yet to announce that if the handset has surpassed any of these players on the leaderboards.  Going by the rumors, the upcoming OnePlus 7 Pro will come with 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with curvy edges on the left and right. And this straightly points at the Samsung. Since Samsung is supplying its displays to big companies like Google and Apple, it won’t really be a surprise.  The screen on this device will be Quad-HD+ (1440 x 3120 pixels) in terms of resolution. If that happens, it would be the first time OnePlus opting for the resolution above Full-HD. The phone may come with a 90Hz refresh rate, which surely is would be a huge upgrade over the OnePlus 6T.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oneplus-7-pro-displaymate.jpg']

Considering the upsurging price of midrange phones, this is quite a good deal.  Overview:  The phone comes with a 6-inch Optic AMOLED display. With Optic AMOLED panel on the board, the contents on the screen look all punchy and vibrant. The display also comes with Full-HD+ resolution because of which contents look sharp. 5T also comes with narrow bezels on the top and bottom without any sorts of notches and cutouts. The display also comes with Gorilla Glass 5 on the top to prevent scratches and scratches during the accidental drops.  Performance wise, the phone gets the Snapdragon 835, which was a flagship chipset two years back. But despite having an old processor, the handset outperforms the smartphones with top-tier midrange processors like the SD675 and SD710. The performance is complemented by 6GB of RAM, which suffices the needs of most of the hardcore gamers. On the storage side, the phone enjoys 64GB of onboard memory. However, there is no SD card slot for storage expansion.         Even on the camera front, the handset doesn’t disappoint. It comes with a dual camera setup at the back, which embraces a 16MP primary shooter backed by a 20MP secondary shooter. The secondary shooter comes with an Intelligent Pixel Technology to enhance the imaging capabilities during the low light scenarios. So apart from portrait images, you can also obtain some sharp shots in the low light.  On the software side, the phone comes with Android Pie with OxygonOS on the top.

"['Nubia Red Magic 3 with 90Hz display, Active cooling technology & big battery launched']",['Nubia'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 29, 2019']",2019-04-29 14:15:00+00:00,"['The gaming community is flourishing and the number of people getting involved in the e-Sports is burgeoning. Although PC gaming and console gaming is flourishing, gaming smartphones are not getting similar popularity. But that does not stop smartphone companies from launching gaming-oriented phones.  Razer , ASUS, and  Xiaomi  have already tested their luck in the gaming arena. In that race, Nubia also stepped ahead with the value-packed gaming phone. Dubbed as Nubia Red Magic 3, the handset comes with industry’s first cooling fan, ICE 2.0 cooling tech, flagship processor, big battery, and connector pins for accessories.  Performance is always a thing of a concerned in the gaming devices. And the Nubia Red Magic 3 has that all covered. The smartphone flaunts the powerful Snapdragon 855, which comes along with up to 12GB of RAM. On the storage side, the phone gets up to 256GB of UFS 2.1 storage. With this setup, the Red Magic 3 is undoubtedly one of the best performers. If the handset leads the AnTuTu benchmark chart, it won’t be a surprise.  Being a gaming phone, the device also packs a plentiful of gaming features. Firstly, there is a dedicated noise cancellation mic, which helps to subdue to background noises for a better conversation with the gaming buddies. The phone has also been provided with two buttons on the top of the device. The fingerprint on this device also acts as a button and can come handy while gaming. Apart from these dedicated buttons, Nubia has included 4D smart shock feature. This feature understands various scenes in the games and adds vibrations to match the scenario.         But such capable hardware also produces quite a lot of heat while playing graphics-intensive games. For that Nubia has incorporated an actual fan to keep the temperature to lower and adjustable values. The phone is first of its kind to have such type of active cooling technology. The handset has also been provided with a second-generation ICE liquid cooling technology. This cooling combo lowers the temperature of the phone by 16 degrees Celsius. Nubia says the cooling effects offered by this cooling hardware can provide up to 500% heat distribution. The manufacturer also boasted that this cooling mechanism covers 32,000 sq. mm, which is said to keep the phone cool even in the extremely heated circumstances.  The Red Magic 3 comes with a geometric design, which screams all gaming. On the back, there is a V-shaped element, on which resides a pentagon-shaped camera. There is also a hexagonal fingerprint scanner just beneath the venting grills. Furthermore, there is an RGB LED strip, which gives an unadulterated gaming vibe. And despite having an actual fan inside the device, the phone is IP55 water and dust resistant.  The phone also gets a special gaming dock pins on its left. Making use of these dock pins, users can attach various gaming-oriented accessories including the Red Magic e-Sports box. This special type of box accessory has the ports for a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB Type-C, and an Ethernet port for fast and uninterrupted internet connection.   Talking about other features, there is a 6.65-inch AMOLED display on the front, which comes with sizable bezels. There is no any type of notches or hole-punch cutouts. The display comes with Full-HD+ resolution and is decently bright at 430 nits. The phone also comes with a 90Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch response rate. The 90Hz refresh rate is quite impressive but also devours a significant amount of battery juice on the go. So Nubia has included an option with which users can switch the refresh rate from 90Hz to 60Hz or let the phone switch it automatically understanding the scenario. Furthermore, there is a DC Dimming feature, which helps the users from eyestrain during the prolonged gaming sessions.  On the imaging part, the phone flaunts a 48MP Sony IMX 586 sensor at its back. There is no secondary camera here. Maybe Nubia assumes that the gamers don’t have an affinity toward the portrait images. Nonetheless, the phone supports 8K recording and super slo-mo recording up to whopping 1920fps. The phone comes with a 16MP shooter on the front.   Even on the audio part, Nubia has been extremely generous. The phone features a dedicated 3.5mm headphone jack, DTS 7.1 channel, and stereo box 3D surround sound speakers. Software-wise, the phone boots on Android Pie out of the box with Redmagic OS 2.0 on the top.  Even on the battery front, the handset is pretty monstrous. It gets a massive 5000mAh battery, which also has support for 27-watt fast charging. Nubia claims that 10 minutes of charging lets the user play the games for 1 full hour.

Going into this laptop sure I was excited, I mean it costs A LOT!! Rs 2,92,900 is a serious amount of money to spend on a laptop, no matter the performance. So, if you are someone who’s been eying this system, well, I have some good and a few bad news for you.  MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8SF Specifications:   Design and Build: \xa0Metal body, plastic bottom panel, 38.3 x 26 x 2.9 cm, 2.5 kg  Display:  15.6″ Full HD (1920 x 1080), 100% sRGB & 85% Adobe RGB, 94% NTSC Color Gamut, 250 nits peak brightness with Anti-Glare  Keyboard:\xa0 Steel-Series Engine 3 Keyboard, Per-key RGB backlighting, 16 million colors, 1.6 mm key travel  Processor: \xa0Hexa-core 8 th \xa0gen i7-8750H processor, Base-Clock @ 2.2 GHz, Turbo Boost Clock up to 4.1 GHz  RAM: \xa0DDR4 16 GB (2x slots, upgradeable up to 32 GB)  Graphics:  8 GB NVidia GeForce RTX 2070  Battery: \xa06-cell 51 Watt-hours (up to 3 hours of backup)  Adapter:\xa0 230 Watts  Storage: \xa0256 GB SATA M.2 SSD (2 x NVMe slots) + 1 TB 7200 HDD  Webcam :\xa0 720p Webcam (@30fps)  Connectivity: \xa0Killer Gb LAN,\xa0802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.0  Ports:\xa0 3 x USB A 3.1, 1 x USB-C (No Thunderbolt 3 support), 1 x 3.5 mm headphone jack, 1 x 3.5mm microphone input, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Mini-display, 1 x RJ-45 Ethernet, 1 x SDcard slot  Price:  Rs. 292,900 ( Buy Here )    Design and Build  If there is one thing that disappointed me was the design. I don’t mean it’s bad in any way, it’s just dated at this point. Practical? Yes, Played out? A big yes. The design language has its own moments, a few curves here, a few RGB there, but it’s come to a point of boredom. Apart from my personal preference, the back panel has two strips of RGB going through which are highly customizable. The Keyboard is RGB, and the USB As light up red.        1  of 3                                                This laptop is sturdy from almost any angle. The only dissatisfaction was the hinge, which just feels flimsy and so easily breakable. Although I have seen the same hinge on numerous other laptops across my friend circle and theirs have been working fine for over 2 years now. So if you are doubtful about the hinge, I wouldn’t worry much.        Display  The display is pretty nice, sure, aesthetics wise, bezels could have been smaller, but as far as the actual panel is concerned, the resolution, refresh rate, and color accuracy are up there with some of the best. For starters, it’s not IPS, maybe it’s a really good TN technology, MSI does state it’s of “IPS level”. With near 100% sRGB color coverage and great viewing angles, you aren’t compromising much (if at all). Since it’s not an IPS panel, you aren’t bound by slow response rates. The specs sheet claims 3ms, which we assume is GTG, and that’s pretty much the best for a portable PC.    And thanks to that powerful GPU, the 144Hz refresh rate will be utilized to it’s fullest extent.  For gamers, this is \xa0just the perfect laptop display, and anything more will see you pay a lot (and we mean an unreasonable amount). It’s also not bad for other tasks here, photo and video editing, media consumption or even just scrolling through your news feed is much more fun on this one. Brightness is also above average at around 250 nits.  Performance  An RTX 2070 and a Core i7-8750H, that’s enough firepower to run any triple-A title out there, but with a 144hz display, any game that runs under the said max refresh rate feels like a waste of display power, but we will get into that later. I ran a couple of games on this one, take a look at the FPS numbers:   Battlefield V: 75-90 (Ultra settings); 50-55 (RTX enabled)  Fortnite: 100-120 (Epic settings)  CS:GO: Above 144 (Ultra settings)  PUBG: 100-130 (Ultra settings)  Fifa 19: Above 144 (Ultra settings)  Apex Legends: 100-120 (Ultra settings)   So, to compare, these are amazing numbers, some of the best I’ve ever experienced actually. Of course, the equation does not take into consideration the RTX 2080 mobile (which I haven’t tested yet) or any desktop grade GPU (which would be an unfair comparison). As far as the 144Hz is concerned, you will be using it to the fullest.  Thermals  No matter how great the numbers are, if the laptop heats up, those are pretty useless. According to HW monitor, the internal temperatures rose up to about 90 degrees for the CPU and 85 degrees for the GPU, and that’s after an hour of gaming. As far as my external heat gun was concerned, it failed to cross the 50-degree mark across the keyboard, top deck or the palm rest.\xa0Plus I would like to add that there was no significant drop in FPS, or at least I didn’t notice any.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The Steel Series keyboard gets a big yes from my side. Call me biased but this could be one of the best keyboards on a laptop, it’s fun to type, easy to game, the key travel is nice and long and the feedback isn’t mushy nor is it harsh. Taking the game a step further are those individually lit RGB keys.        1  of 2                                      What wasn’t a fun experience was that trackpad. It’s average at best, and that’s just not acceptable for a laptop at this price point. The physical buttons are great, they are tactile and functional. But the actual tracking was just a disaster. First off, it is far from accurate, it skips every now and then and if you want precision, well good luck.  Battery and Storage  The battery life is below average, let’s just leave it at that. It’s a tiny 51Wh unit, and the laptop runs for around 3 hours of normal usage. As for storage, you get a really really fast NVMe SSD, with reading speeds of over 3500MBPS. The SSD is a 256GB unit while you also get a 1TB 7200RPM mechanical hard drive for faster storage.  Connectivity      Connectivity   1  of 3               Right         Left         Webcam                     As for connectivity, you get everything from USB As with red backlighting to individual audio jacks for headphones and microphones. You also get a USB-C port, a microSD card slot, a mini HDMI, full-sized HDMI, and an ethernet port. Then there is the Killer 1550i AC wifi for superb wireless connectivity, and a pretty nice sounding speaker system. MSI laptops have always had excellent connectivity options, and this one is no exception.  Conclusion  While all this is great, I feel that going for the RTX 2070 isn’t a must. Sure, it’s better than a GTX1070, but at a premium of over 50k, I don’t think the added fps is worth it. The advantages of an RTX card are pretty much nonexistent here and since you will be playing at FHD resolutions, this GPU is hard to recommend unless your budget for a new gaming laptop actually hovers around 3 lakhs. My only complains were the trackpad, battery life, and the dated design, which most people should be fine with.

['Redmi Note 7 Review: A good phone overshadowed by its ‘Pro’ sibling'],"['Xiaomi', 'Redmi', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 29, 2019']",2019-04-29 07:29:44+00:00,"['Xiaomi’s Redmi series of smartphones usually set benchmarks in the budget and midrange segments. Most of their smartphones offer excellent value for money due to which Redmi phones often crush their competitors. But recently, there are Honor phones, Realme phones, Samsung’s value proposition A-series, and M-series smartphones. With so much competition, I was wondering what’s next for Xiaomi. To cope up the challenges, Xiaomi stepped up and announced a new sub-brand ‘Redmi’. Under the new sub-brand, Xiaomi dropped the bomb in the form of Note 7. When the phone was launched, it created quite a lot of buzz. And I was really interested to find out the recipe Xiaomi has used on this device to stay alive in the competition. so I tried to find that out in this Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 review.  Design  On the design front, Xiaomi has made a major change. Most of the Redmi phones launched last year had either metallic or plastic back. And most of them looked absolutely dull and unappealing. But Xiaomi has done quite an overhaul this time on the design side of things. The bland and outdated metallic back on the Redmi Note 5 and Note 6 Pro is now replaced by a glass slab. This is nothing new for a midrange phone but the switch Xiaomi made on this device is really worth a praise. It is praiseworthy because Xiaomi has included Gorilla glass 5 protection on its already premium-looking glass back. With Gorilla Glass 5 on the board, the phone will have better chances of survival during the accidental drops.         However, the frame is plastic, which I do not find particularly satisfying. With a plastic frame, the durability of the device is quite a thing of concern. And it’s even more concerning as we saw the device failing the durability test performed by JerryRigEverything and Technical Guruji’s durability test video. Although we won’t abuse our phones like the way they do so there is nothing much to be worry yet. And it is quite relieving that the phone feels sturdy on the hold and on the use.   Continuing with the glass back, Xiaomi has added a dual tone gradient finish on the back. And needless to say, it looks absolutely amazing. Plus, the Glass back on this device doesn’t attract much fingerprints like the plastic back.  Display  On the display side, the phone has got a 6.3-inch IPS panel. Just like most of the smartphones available at a similar price, the phone comes with Full-HD+ resolution. So the screen looks sharp while viewing the contents. But when it comes to the colors, they look quite washed out. With dull colors, I didn’t find myself enjoying much while watching the videos. But as far as the brightness is concerned, it does a good job. The screen looks bright and is legible even in broad daylight. So I have nothing to complain on the brightness part.   Redmi Note 7’s display also comes with a notch on the top. Since the notch is very tiny on this device, Xiaomi likes to call the display on this device a “Dot Notch Display”. The notch is very tiny and it isn’t as obtrusive. Maybe that’s the reason why Xiaomi’s has not added the option to hide the notch.   Although Xiaomi has cut down the majority of bezels on the top to increase the screen-to-body ratio, there is a thick chin on the button. The chin also houses a tiny notification LED. Yes, the LED notification on the chin looks awkward. But having one is obviously better than having none.  Although the presence of the LED indicator is a good thing here, I didn’t find it much useful. Just like the Redmi Note 5 and Note 6 Pro, the LED indicator on this device is small, dim and glows only in white. So it’s hard to identify the notification. I might’ve ignored some missed calls thinking it to be a useless Facebook notification.  Camera  The camera is the major highlight of this device. It comes with a 48MP primary shooter and it is the highest of resolution on any smartphone. But despite having such a high-res sensor on the board, the phone captures 12MP images by default. It uses  pixel-binning technology  with which it merges four pixels into one to output bright and sharp images. There is a pro mode as well, where you can capture 48MP images. I tried and tested out the camera on both the modes. But I found 12MP images to be more sharp and bright. And talking about the image quality, they look decent with plenty of details. However, I didn’t find the colors as accurate. The colors on the images look quite dull and faded and don’t look particularly pleasing. So you have to live with that!        1  of 8                                                                                                  On comparing it with the last year’s  Redmi Note 5 AI  camera, I didn’t find much of a difference on the sharpness part. The colors look quite better here but still not so accurate.  But not to worry. This phone is compatible with GCam and images captured from GCam looks better when it comes to color accuracy. Just look at these samples and be the judge yourself. But since everyone are not quite aware of the GCam and it’s not easy to find and download. So I think Xiaomi should focus on the image processing part themselves in the coming days.      Stock Camera Aop Vs GCam App   1  of 10               Camera APP         GCam         Camera App         GCam         Camera App         GCam         Camera App         GCam         Camera App         GCam                                          When it comes to low-light photography, Huawei’s Night Mode, Google’s Night Sight, and OnePlus’s NightScape feature are quite popular in the market. And Xiaomi has added a similar Night Mode feature in its camera UI. In this mode, the phone decreases the shutter speed to 1-2 second and takes some time to process the images to bring out details hiding in the dark. I tested the feature and it did bring images brighter than that captured from the normal mode. A slight increase in details is also can also be noticed in the images captured from the night mode. But noises and grains also pop in the images alongside the increased details. So you have to live with that. Although the feature is not polished, the inclusion of the feature is definitely a good thing. I hope Xiaomi will release an update to make the feature better.      Normal Vs Night Mode   1  of 8               Normal Mode         Night Mode         Normal Mode         Night Mode         Normal Mode         Night Mode         Normal Mode         Night Mode                                    Alongside the primary shooter comes a 5MP depth sensor, which comes in handy while capturing the portrait images. And portrait images look amazing. Yes, it has the color accuracy issue but does really a good job on separating the subject and background. We can still see some imperfection on the hair but apart from that, the edge detection has really got better on this device.      Redmi Note 7 portrait images   1  of 6                                                                              When it comes to the videos, the phone can record up to 1080p movies up to 60 fps. Despite having the hardware setup capable for capturing 4K videos, there is no such option in the camera setting. But with what I have, I record Full-HD videos at 30 fps and 60 fps. And the 30 fps videos were more stable. Despite having an in-built Electronic Image Stabilization, 60fps videos were still quite jittery.  On the selfie side, there is a 13MP shooter on the front, which rests on the tiny notch up front. The selfies too look good but the color seems quite washed out. The skin color also looks quite whitish even with the beauty effects turned off. Similar is the case while capturing the portrait selfies. Colors look quite off and there isn’t anything you can do about it. But apart from the colors, I really like the proficiency of the device while capturing the portrait images. Despite having a single camera, the edge detections were quite good.

Performance  Talking about the performance, the phone comes with the Snapdragon 660 chipset. MI A2, MI 8 Lite and now Redmi Note 7, the choice of the chipset is getting redundant in the books in Xiaomi. That doesn’t mean the processor is bad. It is a good performer for the price and I was pretty satisfied with what it did on my use. Normal apps run like a breeze and multitasking was fluid. Even while playing the games, the phone does a decent job. Light games run without a hiccup. And graphics-intensive games ran with some minor stutters. PUBG is playable at the medium setting with some occasional frame drops and Asphalt 9 followed the same suit. But considering the price, it was understandable.  As far as the memory is concerned, the unit I am using has 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard memory. 64GB of internal memory can suffice the needs of the many. But in case of insufficiency, you can always expand it with an SD card. However, it will take up the SIM2 slot.  Software & UI  Now let’s talk about the software. Software-wise, the phone has got the latest Android Pie with Xiaomi’s customary AdUI. I meant to say MIUI but it is more or less the same. When you are connected to the internet, Ads appear here and there, due to which the phone looks like an Ad platform. And needless to say, it is terribly annoying. Please Xiaomi, don’t make your smartphones so cheap that you have to rely on Ads to make an income. Even after spending a chunk of money, nobody likes to see the filthy Ads popping here and there.   But other than the Ads, the UI is decent. There are tons of customization options to make every setting of the device match your requirements. However, Xiaomi has made some of the features to be location specific. The quick example would be the Face Unlock feature. It’s not available in certain countries so you’ll have to change your location if you want to trigger the feature. It’s been happening for quite a while now. And I couldn’t understand why Xiaomi does this type of discrimination.  Battery  Huge battery is the common trait of Redmi phones. And the tradition continued even in Note 7. There is a massive 4000mAh battery on the device, which provides an amazing backup. On the normal use, the phone backed me for more than a day. At the end of the day, I always found 30% or more charge left on the device. So I honestly have to praise its endurance.  Bigger batteries also have a downside though. It takes a lot of time to get them fully charged. And that problem exists on the Note 7 as well. Despite having support for Quick Charge 4.0, the phone comes with a 10-watt charger on the box. And the stock charger takes around two and a half hours to get it fully charged. Xiaomi recently teased 100-watt fast charging technology. So the inclusion of a mere 10-watt charger didn’t look quite plausible for me. In the upcoming phones, I expect Xiaomi to include a quick charger on the box.   The phone comes with USB-Type C port for charging the device. And it is the first ever Redmi phone to come with the Type-C port. Although it may not matter much to many, it’s a good step forward. Plus there is a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is good news for the audiophiles.  Conclusion  The Redmi Note 7 is a decent phone and is obviously the least expensive phone to feature a 48MP camera. It has got a 48MP camera, good battery life, a decent processor, and most importantly a great design. With the fancy Glass back and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the top, Redmi Note 7 is simply unbeatable at its price when it comes to the design. Although the 48MP is more or less of a gimmick and the shots from the stock camera app is not that great, you get amazing shots when you use the GCam app. So if you use the GCam, Redmi Note 7 is a good camera phone as well.  But the display is quite dull and if you are habituated with the vibrant displays, you will notice the subdued colors right away. So if you are into the good display, Samsung Galaxy A30 will definitely please you with its vibrant Super AMOLED display.   The major downside of the device is the UI polluted with Ads, which is absolutely repelling. So if you dislike such ads-filled UI like I do, you can also consider the  Realme 2 Pro.  The Realme 2 Pro comes with the SD660 so you will get a similar performance. But the UI doesn’t display the Ads, which is a plus point for Realme. The display and camera are also slightly better on the Realme 2 Pro. However, the Realme 2 Pro comes with last year’s Android Oreo and comes with a smaller battery. Also, the plastic back may not be pleasing for the most, especially, when you see a glass back on the smartphone available at the same price.  So weighing all the pros and cons, the Redmi Note 7 is a great phone. And since the device also comes with a variant with 128GB storage for just Rs. 27,000, the smartphone is the best midrange device you can get  under Rs. 25,000  and  Rs. 30,000  price segment. But you have to make a habit of ignoring the filthy Ads.  Pros and Cons  Pros:   Decent design  Good performance  Appreciable Camera (With the GCam)   Cons:   Ad-laden  Dull-looking display  Lack of fast charger on the box']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-review.jpg']

The pillow has been filled with a considerable amount of cushion so as relieve the neck pain of the gamers.         As far as the seat cover is concerned, this gaming chair has incorporated a high-quality top layer cowhide, which won’t get torrid even after prolonged gaming. The seat is filled with 45D high-density cotton. This is to ensure that there will be uniformity of the layer of cushion all over the seat even after prolonged use. This is possible because of the high-density cotton, which uniformly distributes the hip pressure all over the seat.  Xiaomi AutoFull gaming chair is also furnished with 4D e-Sports armrests. The height of the chair can be adjusted pretty easily. On top of that, users can also adjust the backrest by shifting it to the front or back in a similar way of a sports car. The chair is movable and features soft PU wrapped silent rollers to make it move. With the PU wrapped silicon rollers, it does not leave any marks on the floor.   The chair comes in grey, yellow and blue color option and demands a price of CNY 979 ($146) on the purchase.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xiaomi-autofull-gaming-chair.jpg']

And the tweet has explicitly mentioned that “the phone with latest Snapdragon 7__ (announced just two weeks ago) is launching soon in India”. Decrypting the tweet, we believe that the processor here will be one of the recently launched  Snapdragon 730 or 730G . Since there are just two blanks after the digit ‘7’, we believe it to be the former one. Since Xiaomi always brings a performance-oriented device, even it brings the Snapdragon 730G powered the smartphone, it won’t be a surprise.        Xiaomi is always competitive when it comes to the midrange phones, especially amongst the ones available in India. That’s one of the many reasons why the smartphone stood on the top spot in India’s smartphone market share. And in that report, Samsung was in the second position. Since Samsung is going aggressive in the midrange segment, Xiaomi is also acting according.  Samsung recently launched the  Galaxy A80  with the Snapdragon 730G processor, which, however, is yet to launch in India. It’s only a matter of time Samsung will launch the Galaxy A80 in India. Probably it’s to subjugate the Galaxy A80, Xiaomi is planning to launch a similar phone with similar capabilities.  Rumors suggest that this upcoming phone will be the MI A3, the successor of the  MI A2  launched last year. And the rumors have a strong point for argument since Xiaomi has already launched the MI 9 series and Redmi series devices. The MI A3 will feature the stock version of Android Pie. Some speculations also suggest that the phone will have an under-display fingerprint scanner.  If that’s true, Xiaomi will also launch an inferior version of the device as Xiaomi MI A3 Lite. The phone will also be based on Google’s Android One program and will feature a stock version of Android Pie.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Xiaomi-Mi-A2-Review.jpg']

The payments will be made through the crypto tokens when they interact with the Ads. This revenue tokens or the Basic Attention Token (BAT) is provided to the users on a monthly basis.  Crypto tokens may not be usable for the most. But it has been said that these kinds of reward tokens can also be exchanged with items like restaurant vouchers, gift cards, and also the real money.

Brave has pledged that it will not give out the user information to other parties. The company says it issues Ads based on the users’ browsing habits and the previous Ads interactions. Brave has currently collaborated with 250 Ad sponsors and those who agreed to see the Ads will see Ad from one of these sponsors.

General Manager of Redmi, Lu Weibing confirmed back in February that the company was coming out with a flagship  Redmi phone powered by the Snapdragon 855 . And while the release date was only a guess back then, the GM again hinted that it is coming very soon!  According to Lu Weibing’s post, the Redmi flagship will be the most affordable Snapdragon 855 phone by far. The price will surely, be a shocker!         The recently launched  Meizu 16s , for now, is the cheapest phone with a Snapdragon 855. So, if we go by what he says, we’re probably looking at something to follow the footsteps of  Pocophone F1 . Maybe, this is the new Pocophone F2, even? Who knows? Xiaomi does crazy things with their pricing… So, it won’t be much of a surprise even if it is indeed the Poco F2!  Anyways, the GM tipped that the upcoming phone will have a higher screen aspect ratio, better camera, better battery, and better performance. Of course, he didn’t say compared to what…but he claims that the device is worth waiting for. If we get a similar device to the Pocophone F1 with improvements, it might be well, worth it.   A while back, Xiaomi co-founder and president, Lin Bin was spotted with a mysterious phone featuring a pop-up camera as well. So, we might also be looking at some new features with on the new phone. But we can’t be sure, of course. Also, there isn’t any other information about the device. Except that it will have  triple cameras , a large  6.39″ Full HD+ display , and  4000 mAh battery .

And in this regard, the pop-up cameras seem to be the new standard. While other companies are coming out with things like Shark fin pop-ups, like the  Oppo Reno , Huawei is just about to launch it’s first pop-up camera smartphone – the  Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 .  Of course, these are, but rumors. But the source we have is legit. Huawei is set to launch a pop-up camera phone sometime this year, and very soon. And since this is going to be a Y-series device, you can expect it to be much more affordable than what other pop-up camera phones, like  Vivo V15  and  Oppo F11 Pro  cost!  Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 Overview  First off, the Huawei Y9 Prime will have a good sized  6.59″ IPS LCD display , with  Full HD+ resolution . And with it having a pop-up selfie camera, there will be no notches or such on it. So, the display experience is going to be something to look forward to.        And since the world is moving up with  3 cameras  even in the mid-range and budget sector, like the  Vivo Y17 , Huawei is going to do the same. This phone will come equipped with three cameras – a  16 MP primary camera , an  8 MP Ultra-wide angle camera  and a  2 MP depth sensor.  The pop-up selfie camera will be a  16 MP lens .  Under the hood, we can expect the phone to be powered by a  Kirin 710  chip, Huawei’s mid-range chipset. The chipset based on the 12nm process is comparable to the Snapdragon 660 and Helio P60 / P70. There’s about  4 GB RAM  while storage is about  128 GB . However, we’re not sure about it being expandable. But we’re sure it will come with a  fingerprint sensor  at the back. Yet, we’re unsure about it having a Face Unlock feature.  The Huawei Y9 Prime 2019 will also have a  big 4000 mAh  battery. But it’s highly unlikely it will have a Fast Charging standard. However, it will have a  USB Type-C  port on it, which is a good step forward for phones in such price range.  Price and Availability  The phone has not come out yet. It is, still, in its rumor stages. But since our source is legit, we believe there won’t be many changes in the above-mentioned specs. Pricing is not yet known.\xa0 But keep in mind that this phone is a Y-series, so, it will definitely be affordable. We’re guessing somewhere  less than $300 , which makes it pretty affordable for a pop-up camera phone.  So, what do you think of the Huawei Y9 Prime 2019? Do you think, it will be the next big thing in the affordable mid-range segment? Let us know.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Huawei-Y9-Prime-2019.jpg']
['Samsung firevase is a flower vase that doubles as a throwable fire extinguisher'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 25, 2019']",2019-04-25 10:48:15+00:00,"['Fire can start anytime. Especially in the electricity driven environment, a short circuit can happen anytime and things can get on fire. At home, there are even higher chances because of the kitchens. Wouldn’t it be cool if you can extinguish the fire with the decorative stuff furnished in the houses and offices? Well,  Samsung’s  subsidiary company called the Cheil Worldwide came with a similar concept and designed the ‘Firevase’.  Firevase is actually a vase that can hold a flower and serves as a decorate material when kept in a room. But in case of the fire, you can throw it to a burning place to put out the blazing fire. The vase comes with a small compartment on the inside, which holds the flower. The outside chamber is filled with potassium carbonate, which cools down and suppresses oxygen when the vase is smashed. Most of us know that fire requires oxygen to get burning. In the absence of oxygen, fire extinguishes and the company used the same trick to put out the fire almost instantaneously.         This Firevase is getting success in Samsung’s homeland South Korea. The rule to have a fire extinguisher in a home has been mandatory since 2017. However, less than 60% of the population had one. But with the firevase coming into the limelight that population surged by a laudable 8%. Since this fire extinguisher doesn’t tarnish the décor of the house, the majority of the population has been attracted by the product.  Earlier reports suggested that the company produced 100,000 units of the firevases as a part of the publicity campaign. After the success of the campaign, Cheil Worldwide is now striving to produce 200,000 more units of the vases.  Although this dual purpose vase sounds whimsy, it could be lifesaving at times. But can it truly replace the traditional type of fire extinguishers? That’s yet to be seen.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-firevase-throw-fire-extinguisher.png']

But with the Vivo Y17, even the budget phone segment is getting the taste of triple cameras!  The only other Vivo’s phones to sport triple cameras are the  Vivo V15  and the  V15 Pro , apart from their flagships. But these two devices still cost upwards of some $400. The Y17, however, costs about $260. And I get that it’s not strictly budget territory, it’s still less than a typical mid-range device.

As far as the imaging department is concerned, there is a single shooter on both ends. The rear camera utilizes a 13MP sensor whereas the selfie shooter on the notch gets a 5MP sensor. The selfie shooter on the device is also responsible for authenticating the facial data while using the Face Unlock feature. The Face Unlock feature is said to identify 1024 facial features.

The device was launched a couple of weeks back in China. With already making a mark in the home nation, Oppo traveled overseas and announced to launch the device in Europe as well. At an event in Zurich, Switzerland, Oppo announced to bring three products to Europe. Alongside the 10x Zoom Edition, the vanilla Reno and the Reno 5G will join the 10x Zoom edition in that expedition.  Oppo Reno  Talking about the specs, the regular Reno gets the 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display enriched with Full-HD+ resolution. The screen on this device is capped with Gorilla Glass 6 to ensure protection during the accidental falls. The display on this device also comes with DCI-P3 color gamut.  On the performance side, the phone comes with Snapdragon 710 chipset with 6/8GB of RAM at its arsenal. The Reno comes in two formats on the storage side: one with 128GB of onboard memory, whereas the higher end flaunts a substantial 256GB. But sadly, it doesn’t have an SD card slot for the storage expansion.         Talking about the camera, the device boasts a dual cam setup at the back. The setup looks wildly similar with the  Oppo F11 Pro  with 48MP primary camera and 5MP depth sensor. But it’s a completely different story on the front. The F11 Pro comes with a pop-up selfie camera in a rectangular cartridge. But on the Oppo Reno, the cartridge of the pop-up selfie camera looks like a shark fin and hence the name shark fin pop-up selfie camera.  As far as the software is concerned, Oppo has included the Android Pie with Oppo’s custom skin ColorOS 6 on the top. A 3765mAh battery fuels the device, which comes with a 20-watt VOOC Flash Charge support. Surprisingly, Oppo has furnished a USB Type-C port for charging the device.  The handset comes with Under-display fingerprint scanner to ensure the security. And the good part is, they didn’t ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack to incorporate the hardware. Plus there is a Stereo speaker setup to please the audiophiles.

The device flaunts a camera triplet on its rear panel. Just like the vanilla version, the primary shooter here employs a 48MP sensor, which comes with an f/2.0 lens. The second one suits with an 8MP sensor and an ultra-wide-angle lens. The last one is a 13MP periscope-style camera, which is said to capture images with 10x zooming. But the hardware setup signifies that the device can perform optical zooming only up to 6x. 10x zooming can be achieved through hybrid zoom just like on the Huawei P30 Pro. Taking about the ultra-wide-angle lens, it can expand the view up to 0.6x. Both the primary and periscope camera comes with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) to avoid jitters and shakes while recording videos.   On the front, the camera hardware is the same. Just like the regular Reno variant, the 10x zoom features shark fin style pop-up selfie camera with a 16MP sensor.  The performance part is handled by Snapdragon 855 chipset. The handset comes with 8GB of RAM to complement the performance. Storage wise, the phone will be available with 256GB of onboard memory.  Display wise, the phone comes aboard with a 6.6-inch Super AMOLED panel. The screen enjoys Full-HD+ resolution with DCI-P3 color coverage to ensure better color accuracy. Underneath the display lies a fingerprint scanner, which handles the security part. As far as the battery goes, a 4065mAh cell delivers the power to keep the device awake. On the software part, users will get Android Pie (v9.0) with ColorOS 6 overlay.  The phone also comes with a stereo speaker setup but sadly, there is no 3.5mm headphone. Nonetheless, Oppo managed to incorporate Dolby Audio to enhance audio quality.  The Reno 5G is based on the 10x Zoom version. It comes with the 5G modem and support communication through 5G channels.

And with the pace, Oppo is approaching, the Reno 5G could likely be the first 5G phone to be available in Europe.  Different telecoms from various nations already started launching the 5G networks and some are on the quick verge of doing so. The Swisscom launched its 5G network in Zurich just two weeks back. EE will test its 5G network in June.   On the price part, the vanilla Reno is a midrange phone tagged along with the starting price of €500. The phone will be available in countries like France, The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and Poland starting from the 10 th  of May. The Reno 5G will also launch in these countries sometimes in May. But the standard 10x zoom Edition will take a while to hit the market. It is said to debut sometime in June on the aforementioned European nations.  Alongside the announcement of the devices, Oppo also proclaimed that it will provide International Warrant Service to the 10X Zoom and 5G variants. With this kind of service, users can repair their devices via authorized Oppo service center located in any country where Oppo has an official sales channel. There is no such facility for the regular Oppo Reno though.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-edition.jpg']

"['Lenovo Z6 Pro with SD 855, Quad rear cameras & big battery launched in China']",['Lenovo'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 24, 2019']",2019-04-24 08:40:05+00:00,"['In December last year, Lenovo left us all surprised by releasing the  Z5 Pro . The handset was the first smartphone to feature the  Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset . And roughly after 6 months later, Lenovo surprised us all over again. And this time with the Lenovo Z6 Pro. This latest smartphone comes with all the top-tier features, which only a few of the smartphone manufacturers are managing to provide.  Camera  Most of the smartphone manufacturers are striving to provide multiple camera setup on their device. In that trend, quad-camera setup on the rear panel is still a rare feature. But Lenovo went all out and included a total of four cameras on the back. The primary camera on this device employs a 48MP sensor and an f/1.8 lens.         The second camera uses an ultra-wide-angle lens with a 16MP sensor. An 8MP shooter has also been provided for lossless telephoto zooming. Apart from that, Lenovo has included a 2MP dedicated video camera with OIS to enhance the quality of the videos. Lastly, there is a ToF 3D camera for better edge detection in the portrait images and for the Augmented Reality (AR). As far as the selfie camera is concerned, a 32MP shooter on the front handles the job.  That’s all about the camera hardware. Even on the software part, there are plenty of features. Super Night Scene, Super Macro, and Super Wide Angle features are few of the many.  Performance  On the performance side, Lenovo has Snapdragon 855, the best chipset for an Android smartphone out there. And to complement the performance, Lenovo has included 6GB RAM, which goes all the way up to 12GB on the highest-end variant. Talking about the storage, users will have a choice between 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB.   With this setup, the handset is obviously powerful. So users can all sort of top tiers games on this device. With high workloads, the device also produces a significant amount of heat. And to ensure better heat dissipation and to keep the temperature of the device low, Lenovo claims it has integrated “PC-grade Coldfront liquid cooling system”.  Display  The Lenovo Z6 Pro comes with a 6.53-inch Super AMOLED display complemented by Full-HD+ resolution. The AMOLED display on the Z6 Pro also supports features like DCI-P3 color gamut,\xa0DC Dimming, and HDR 10. The Z6 Pro also comes with narrow bezels around the display with a tiny notch on the top. Although the image might have truly portrayed the size of the notch, there are still good reasons to be suspicious about the size of the bezels. Render images are often deceptive when it comes to the size of the bezels.  Under the display rests an in-display fingerprint, which happens to be optical one unlike the  Galaxy S10/S10+ . The fingerprint sensor comes with a bigger recognition area and also comes with the ability to detect the wet fingers.  Battery, Software & Connectivity  Fueling the device is a 4000mAh battery, which also comes with a 27-watt fast charging. The phone employs a USB Type-C for charging the battery and for file transfer. On the software side, the phone boots with Android Pie with Lenovo’s custom skin ZUI on the top. The software on the device has also managed to include features like Game Turbo mode to enhancing the gaming performance.  The phone has also excelled on the connectivity front. The Z6 Pro comes with dual-SIM support, Dual-frequency GPS, Bluetooth 5.0, and 3.5mm headphone jack. To ensure better audio capabilities, Lenovo has also included aptX HD audio codec support and Dolby Atmos support.  Lenovo Z6 Pro specifications   Dsplay:  6.39-inch (1080 × 2340 pixels) Full HD+ AMOLED HDR10 display with DCI-P3 color gamut; 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Chipset:  Snapdragon 855; 7nm Mobile Platform  CPU:  Octa-Core (1 x 2.84GHz\xa0 Kryo 485 + 3 x 2.42GHz Kryo 485 + 4x 1.80GHz Kryo 485)  GPU:  Adreno 640  RAM:  6GB/8GB/2GB LPDDR4x RAM  Storage:  128GB/256GB/512GB internal memory, expandable memory up to 512GB with microSD  Software:  Android 9.0 (Pie) with ZUI 11  Rear Camera:  (48MP wide-angle, f/1.8, PDAF) + (16MP ultra-wide-angle, f/2.2) + (8MP telephoto camera, f/2.4) + (2MP super video camera, f/1.8, 2.9um, OIS) + ToF camera, LED Flash  Front Camera:  32MP, f/2.0  In-display fingerprint sensor  3.5mm audio jack, Dolby Atmos  Connectivity:  Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 ac (2.4GHz + 5GHz), Bluetooth 5, GPS (L1 + L5 dual band) +\xa0GLONASS, USB Type-C  Battery:  4000mAh battery with 27W fast charging   Price & Availability  Talking about the price, the base variant (6/128GB) is priced at CNY 2,899 ($430). The 8/128GB and 12/512GB variant accordingly demands a price of CNY 2,999 ($450) and CNY 4,799 ($715) respectively.   The phone will come in Red and Green color variants and will go on sale in China starting from 29 th  of April, 2019. There is no information regarding the launch of the device outside of China.

They have flagships, buffed up flagships and semi-flagships. Samsung has the  Galaxy S10 , Galaxy S10 Plus, and the  Galaxy S10e . Similarly, Huawei has its  P30 Pro  and the P30. And it was enough for OnePlus to join this bandwagon too! We will now get a  OnePlus 7  and a  OnePlus 7 Pro .  It’s already official! There were image leaks of those phones on Weibo a while back. While the OnePlus 7 was leaked way back in March, the OnePlus 7 Pro surfaced only some time ago. But now, they’re official. OnePlus’ CEO, Pete Lau confirmed that the phones were  coming out on May 14 , in the official event happening in New York at Pier 94. There does not seem to be much of a difference in aesthetics, but let’s see what the inside will hold.         Similarities include the same chipset, the  Snapdragon 855 . However, the Pro variant might be 5G enabled with an X50 modem…or maybe they’ll come out with another variant of that. The base models will have  8 GB RAM , and rumors suggest they might push it up to 12 GB! As much silly as it is to have 12 GB RAM, it’s not strange for OnePlus. They already were pushing bigger RAMs than their competitors.  Source:  Weibo  Both of them will have  triple cameras  at the back, but there are no specifications about them yet. But like so many of today’s phones, we can guess the primary lens will be a  48 MP one ! Storage will start from  128 GB  on the OnePlus 7 while it might start at 256 GB on the Pro variant. Also, another difference includes the display size. The OnePlus 7 will have  6.5″ Optic AMOLED display  while the other will have a larger  6.67″ one . No word on the battery though. And of course, how can we forget that they will now have  pop-up selfie cameras ?  There is no word on the pricing yet.

A device that unfolds into a tablet and remains as a smartphone in a folded form, that’s already a dope tech. This innovative piece of tech also garnered galore of applauds from the tech enthusiasts since its announcement. But the tech seems quite raw in terms of developments. And the recent screen breakages clearly implied that the device is not yet ready to sail to the consumers’ end. Samsung had announced to launch the device in China on the 24 th  and 26 th  of April. But this failure made the Samsung wary so it released a press release announcing the postponements of the launch event. Alongside the launch, Samsung also delayed the Galaxy Fold employee training for an indefinite time.  The Galaxy Fold Failure incidents  Samsung had sent Galaxy Fold units to the various tech reviewers and other celebrities. And this issue comes into the limelight as the units on the reviewers’ end started flashing to the death. And these screen failures unfolded  two fatal screen damaging scenarios .  The first reason for the screen failure was due to peeling of the protective plastic layer atop of the display. Since most of the smartphone these days comes aboard with the screen protector, it was an easy thing to get confused. Also, there were no warning and indications against that. So it’s not actually the fault of the reviewers.        Another issue was with the device itself. There seem to have some problems with the display of folding mechanism because of which the screen flashed to death while folding and unfolding the device.      Galaxy Fold issues   1  of 2               Source: Twitter / MKBHD         Source: Twitter / Mark Gurman                  The Aftermath  Understanding the gravity of the situation, Samsung released a press release that it will take some time to rectify the issues. And for that, the South Korean tech giant postponed the launch event and apologized for the delay. However, Samsung has not yet announced when it will officially launch the device. And Samsung hopes everyone will understand the situation. Since it’s a $1,980 device, we think everyone will understand the situation and wait for a finished product rather than rushing for a half-baked device. But this may tarnish Samsung’s reputation in the tech industry for a while.  Below is Samsung’s official announcement for the Samsung Galaxy Fold delay.  “We recently unveiled a completely new mobile category: a smartphone using multiple new technologies and materials to create a display that is flexible enough to fold. We are encouraged by the excitement around the Galaxy Fold.  While many reviewers shared with us the vast potential they see, some also showed us how the device needs further improvements that could ensure the best possible user experience.  To fully evaluate this feedback and run further internal tests, we have decided to delay the release of the Galaxy Fold. We plan to announce the release date in the coming weeks.  Initial findings from the inspection of reported issues on the display showed that they could be associated with an impact on the top and bottom exposed areas of the hinge. There was also an instance where substances found inside the device affected the display performance.  We will take measures to strengthen the display protection. We will also enhance the guidance on care and use of the display including the protective layer so that our customers get the most out of their Galaxy Fold.  Samsung  values the trust of its customers’ place in us and they are always our top priority. We are committed to working closely with customers and partners to move the industry forward. We want to thank them for their patience and understanding.”']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-fold.jpg']

['Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review: The Best Budget Phone So Far?'],"['Redmi', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Xiaomi']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 23, 2019']",2019-04-23 08:59:59+00:00,"['Xiaomi launches three budget phones for its Redmi series every year. This year too, it came up with the Redmi 7 series with a normal variant, a Note variant, and a Pro variant. And like the previous years, the  Note 7  And the  Note 7 Pro  have taken all the spotlight.  The Redmi 7 here is the cheapest among the bunch and offers good improvements over the last years Redmi 6, at least on paper. So, let’s find out if the Redmi 7 provides enough value for the price like its siblings.         Xiaomi Redmi 7 Specifications   Display:\xa0 6.26-inch IPS HD+ display, Gorilla Glass 5 Protection, 19:9 aspect ratio @ 269PPI  Chipset:  Octa-core Qualcomm\xa0Snapdragon 632  GPU : Adreno 506  RAM:\xa0 2 GB / 3 GB  Storage:\xa0 16 GB / 32 GB; Expandable up to 512GB via SD card (dedicated slot)  OS:\xa0 Android Pie (v9.0) with MIUI 10 on the top  Rear Camera:  Dual camera  –  12 MP, f/2.2, 1.25 μm, PDAF + 2 MP, depth sensor; LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 8MP  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 4000mAh with Quick Charge 3.0 support; Uses Micro USB 2.0 port  Colors:\xa0 Black, Blue, Red  Price : Rs. 13,999  (2/32GB)  | Rs. 15,999  (3/32GB)\xa0   Design and Build  The Redmi 7, as expected, comes in a glossy plastic body and a plastic frame. On hands though, the feel is not very cheap. It feels sturdy enough, unlike last years Redmi 6 which had creaks and poor build quality.  This shiny plastic back, however, can easily get scratches and on a long run you will lose colors and it will wear out, So, the first thing you should do if you are getting this phone is buy a decent back cover.   One of the major upgrades the Redmi 7 has received over the Redmi 6 is the design up front. While the 6 had a smaller 5.45-inch display that came without any notch, the Redmi 7 has a big 6.26-inch display with a waterdrop notch.  Even with the large bezel on the bottom, Xiaomi has made some use of the space adding in an LED notification indicator. Good job, Xiaomi!  Display  The display we are looking at here is an HD display which is definitely not sharp if you compare it against full HD displays, but it’s still good enough for the price. The display is colorful and fairly color accurate. It is bright and gets the job done while you are using it outside.   This display also offers a variety of settings to change the colors and contrast, so you can change as per your liking.  The best thing about this display is it is protected by a Gorilla Glass 5. I think this is the first time I have seen a gorilla glass 5 on a budget phone. However, with the dust swirling around the environment, I suggest you apply a tempered glass to add an extra level of protection.  Performance  Another talking point of the Xiaomi Redmi 7 is the internals. This device has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 inside, which is quite a performer. There are two variants of the phone, and the one I reviewed is the 3 + 32 GB RAM, and if you’re buying this device, buy this variant and not the 2 + 16 GB version. Since you are getting quite a decent processor, the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage variant won’t be enough if you intend to install and play a lot of high-end games.  With the Snapdragon 632, even high demanding games like PUBG and Asphalt 9 runs smoothly on medium settings. For the price, everything works like the way it’s supposed to, and even while running a few applications on the background, I haven’t really faced stutters. But there are times when the applications take a while to open up. It’s not always but several times, the time I tap the app icon and the time it takes to load up is around a second or two.  Xiaomi Redmi 7 Benchmark Tests   Geekbench v4.3.2   Single-core: 1246  Multi-core: 4336    AnTuTu v7:   105764    3D Mark   Slingshot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1: 513  Slingshot Extreme Vulkan: 542    Andro Bench   Sequential Read: 298.56 MB/s  Sequential Write: 122.31 MB/s     Software and UI   The Xiaomi Redmi 7 runs on Android v9 Pie out of the box with Xiaomi’s own skin on top. The MIUI 10 software helps with the software experience, there are a lot of customizations in stores, and everything feels snappy. I still don’t like the lack of app menu, and also the fact that there are several pre-installed applications that you cannot delete. And obviously, with Xiaomi, you get ads here and there in the user interface. Also, the window that always pops up when you install an application is an absolute nuisance.  Camera   Now, the Redmi 7 is a budget-oriented device. So, testing out the cameras on the phone, I had kept my expectations low. Specs wise, there’s a 13MP primary sensor with an extra 2 MP depth sensor for portraits, and that’s what I checked first.        1  of 2                                      The portrait shot on the phone, well, check out the skin color. That picture looks like someone just applied an Instagram effect on it. Yes, the overall picture might look good, but that skin color is not at all natural. And it’s really inconsistent with the edge detection too.   In terms of the color tone from normal images, the Redmi 7 captures pictures with a colder tone in a daylight environment. The color tone depends completely on a user’s preference though. So, no judgment here.   Talking about the details, the photos look good normally, but if you zoom into it, you will notice the lack of sharpness and details on the images.   What’s nice on the Redmi 7’s rear camera photos is the saturation. While smartphones from various manufacturers, for example, Samsung, opt for oversaturated colors, the Redmi 7 remains true and that’s one of the plus points of its cameras.   But in terms of dynamic range, the shadow detail is quite poor, and you won’t really notice it. Even though the highlight details are well saturated, and the exposure control is decent, you won’t be able to see the objects where the shadow lies.  Talking about the night time shots, well, the Redmi 7 is average at its best. What you will notice right away on its images are the grains and noise.   If there is a light source, the photos have quite a bit of detail which is decent for the price. Check out these buildings, although there is a lack of details on the photos, the overall image quality is good, and even appealing.  On to the video quality, what I am really impressed with is that this budget device is capable of shooting full HD videos at 60 fps. And it is smooth too, although you will notice slight wobbles. Also, the colors are washed out, especially a person’s skin.   Finally, let’s talk about the selfie. There is an 8-megapixel front-facing camera residing in the notch and it does an okay job and is better than what you get from the back cameras. Just look at the image, it’s decent for the price, right? But again, the skin tone is not very natural.        1  of 2                                      The portrait from the front camera is purely software, but it does an okay job. You also get AI beauty options and it’s quite good and not as aggressive as what you get from Vivo and OPPO.  Extras  \xa0  One of the subtle design changes is the dual speaker grills on the bottom of the phone. Being a budget device, obviously, it has only one speaker on one of the grills that actually gets pretty loud but the quality is nothing to write home about.  The thing that hasn’t changed is the placement of the fingerprint scanner on the back. The scanner is quite fast which is really impressive for a budget phone. There’s also face unlock feature which is again fast, but since it’s done by the front camera, it’s not as reliable as the fingerprint sensor.   A good inclusion on the phone is the IR blaster which is helpful in controlling various electronic devices. But the thing Xiaomi has failed to add is the gyro sensor and that is quite strange as the previous Redmi phones had it. It comes in handy while tracking rotations and for VR.  Battery  The battery is also the strongest part of the Redmi 7. The Redmi series, apart from a couple of devices, has been a trademark when it comes to larger batteries, and this time it’s no different. There is a large 4,000 mAh battery inside, which does a commendable job.   In my use, which constituted of watching an episode of Game of Thrones, playing games for a couple of hours, browsing through social media and different websites, the phone gave a screen on time of 6 hours. This is amazing, and for a “normal” user, you should be able to use it for a day and a half.  For charging, you get a micro-USB, no Type C and Xiaomi has included a 10W charger. The device does support Quick Charge 3.0, but for keeping the price low, Xiaomi has included the low-power charger in the box.  With an 18W fast charger, it fully charged the phone in 2 hours. So, you would want to buy a fast charger.  Conclusion   The Redmi 7 is probably on the shadow of the Note 7 and the Note 7 Pro. It’s not as popular as its siblings, but on my test, with the efficient yet powerful professor and the HD display, the phone performed quite well. But it has its own shortcomings. The device’s camera setup shows promise but it’s not up there and some might not like the design. But you should take a look at the pricing. The device has a great battery life, a decent display, and ticks the boxes of the primary necessities of a smartphone. And for the price and the features it packs, it’s a device you should take a look at right away!      Pros  Cons    – Great Performance  – Ad-laden software    – Good battery life  – Cameras aren’t up to the mark    – Value for Money  – The plastic back will wear off']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/xiaomi-redmi-7-review.jpg']
['Realme 3 Pro and Realme C2 Launched – Head to head with the Redmi series?'],['Realme'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['April 22, 2019']",2019-04-22 12:01:20+00:00,"['With all the smartphone brands gearing up and launching their phones for the year, it’s now Realme’s turn. The year-old company has played its card – launched two phones, both of which, are a successor to last year’s devices. It’s the  Realme 3 Pro  and the Realme C2, successors to the  Realme 2 Pro  and the  Realme C1 . So, you can tell, the C2 is a budget option while the Realme 3 Pro is more mid-range.  Realme C2 Overview  The Realme C2, as expected comes with a plastic body and a design that’s all too generic. It doesn’t look like there have been many improvements in the design front. The Realme C2 features a  6.1″ IPS LCD display  with HD+ resolution. That is to be expected of a budget phone, however.         Camera wise, you get a  dual camera setup  of  13 MP and a 2 MP depth sensor . As for selfies, there is a  5 MP unit  on the water-drop notch up front. Also, this phone runs on the  Helio P22  as compared to last year’s Snapdragon 450. That does mean a slightly improved performance on paper, but let’s see how it fares, though. Storage wise, there are 2 variants. The base model comes with  2 GB RAM  and  16 GB storage , whereas, another variant has a  3 GB RAM  and  32 GB storage . But if the storage is not enough, they are expandable via microSD card slot.  As for the battery, strangely, this phone sees a downgrade. The Realme C2 has a  4000 mAh,  compared to 4230 mAh on the C1. And being a budget phone, I don’t expect it to have any kind of Fast Charging. It runs on  ColorsOS 6  based on Android Pie and is priced at  $86 (INR.6000)  for the base model whereas the 3 / 32 GB variant costs  $115 (INR.8000) .  Realme C2 Specifications:   Display : 6.1″ IPS LCD panel with HD+ resolution (720 x 1560 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Dual, 13 MP Primary with f/2.2 aperture and PDAF + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : Single, 5 MP  Processor : 2 GHz Octa-core Helio P22  GPU : PowerVR GE8320  RAM : 2 GB / 3 GB  Storage : 16 GB / 32 GB, expandable up to 256 GB via dedicated microSD card  Battery : 4000 mAh  OS : Android 9.0 Pie, ColorsOS 6 on top   Realme 3 Pro Overview  This mid ranger packs no surprises as most of what it features were already on the rumors list. So, this one too has a plastic body just like its predecessor. However, the display has a  Gorilla Glass 5  protection, which is an upgrade.   The display is  6.3″ Full HD+ IPS LCD panel . You still have the water-drop notch on it that houses the selfie camera. No surprises there! As for the cameras, you have a dual camera set up at the back. The setup comprises of a  16 MP primary camera  along with a  5 MP depth sensor . But since it uses no  pixel binning , maybe the image quality will be as good as that on the  Redmi Note 7 Pro , if not better. The selfie camera, here, is a good 25 MP.  In addition, this phone runs on the  Snapdragon 710 , which is slightly superior to the  Redmi Note 7 Pro ‘s Snapdragon 675. With  6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage  on the higher-end variant, this might very well go head to head with the Redmi Note 7 Pro. As for the battery, there is a  4000 mAh  unit along with a VOOC 3.0 Fast Charging, but still microUSB.  This phone is priced at  INR.14000 ($200)  for the 4 / 64 GB variant and  INR.17000 ($244) .

['Samsung Galaxy S10e Review – Size matters not!'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['April 21, 2019']",2019-04-21 08:50:59+00:00,"['With smartphone companies focusing on getting large display experiences, I almost forgot what it was like to hold something that fitted snugly in my hands. Enter the  Samsung Galaxy S10e ! A phone that is just the right size, cuts just the right corners and does ALMOST everything right. Now, this is a semi-flagship phone, and it’s a nice concept to provide users a flagship experience for a not-so-flagship kind of money. And why should you choose this over the other larger variants of the Galaxy S10 series? Let’s talk about it.  Samsung Galaxy S10e Specifications:   Design : Glass body, aluminum frame (Gorilla Glass 5 front & back), IP68 Water & Dust Resistance  Display : 5.8″ Dynamic AMOLED with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2280 pixels), 19:9 aspect ratio, 438 PPI pixel density  Rear Camera : Dual, 12 MP Primary lens with variable aperture (f/1.5 – f/2.4) and dual pixel PDAF & OIS + 16 MP Ultrawide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture  Front Camera : Single, 10 MP lens with f/1.9 aperture  Processor : Octa-core Exynos 9820 (8 nm)  GPU : Mali-G76 MP12  RAM : 6 GB  Storage : 128 GB internal, expandable up to 512 GB  OS : One UI based on Android Pie  Battery : 3100 mAh, 15-Watt Adaptive Fast Charging, Reverse Wireless Charging  Sensors : Fingerprint (side-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer  Colors : Prism White, Prism Black, Prism Green, Prism Blue  Price : $750 (international), Rs.73,9999 (offer price)   Design  I’ll start by talking about what I liked the most – its compact size, nifty design, and how perfectly it fits in my hand. Its small size is, surprisingly, one of its major attractive features. I don’t have anything against a big screen experience, but you need to hold it to believe it. It’s super manageable in the hand, yet doesn’t skimp on power!      Samsung Galaxy S10e Design   1  of 3               S10e Prism White                S10e Prism Black                     Curved edges surround the phone, but it doesn’t have tapered sides of the more expensive Galaxy S10 models. Nevertheless, the flat screen works really well – if anything, I didn’t even feel its absence. With a  Gorilla Glass 5  both front and back, the phone does look premium, but Samsung chose to go with a Gorilla Glass 5 instead of the 6 like on the larger S10 variants. I wonder how much money they saved with it…            Samsung Galaxy S10e design   1  of 3               Bottom Ports         Left buttons         Right Power button                     Anyways, the  power button on the right embeds a fingerprint scanner  as well. It’s another cut-back, but no complaints. It’s faster than the in-display scanners, anyway. You still get the  3.5 mm headphone jack , and there are  dual speakers  on this thing – one at the bottom, and another one on the earpiece. And together, they make for some good stereo-like audio experience.  Overall, I think the best part about this phone is its form factor while still packing the power.  Display  However, having a smaller size also makes for a smaller display. The Samsung Galaxy S10e features a  5.8” Dynamic AMOLED punch-hole display . There are some bezels around the sides and a chin, but they’re not all that intrusive. If you’re coming from older Galaxy devices, then, it won’t even matter.   The display clocks at  Full-HD+ resolution , not QHD like the bigger variants. But I feel like QHD is not even necessary. Yes, they do give you some wonderful experience, but all content is not QHD. Plus, it eats up your battery. I even set the display on the Galaxy S10 to Full HD+. So, for this small device such as this, a Full HD+ is more than enough. The Dynamic AMOLED does a great job with colors. Colors are vibrant, and the amount of details are great. Plus, having a smaller display makes for crispier pixel density! Samsung is on top of their game in displays, and it shows. Plus, it  supports HDR 10+ , meaning that you can watch selected contents with a wider dynamic range.   The small punch-hole is also not very intrusive, and won’t affect your viewing experience all that much. With clever wallpapers, you can easily hide it. And most times, you won’t even notice it’s there!  Camera  As for the cameras, the Samsung Galaxy S10e packs a dual camera set up at the back – a  12 MP primary lens  with variable apertures, and a  16 MP ultrawide-angle lens . These are the same lens as on the larger S10 variants, so, no compromises here either.   And the photos look wonderful. In bright light, the camera performance is as expected: sharp, packing a lot of details, excellent dynamic range and noise-less. Colors are pretty accurate, too, and most of them feel true to life. There is a slightly warm tone on the images, that looks pleasing to the eyes, though.

Some colors look juicier, while others can look a bit too overboard. As it is with these AI image enhancements, you have to use it only when necessary.

You can capture panoramic scenes and get more in your frames, and this is the one to use when it comes to capturing sceneries or group photos. The image quality on this one is also as good as ultra-wide-angle lenses can get. Images from this one have good dynamic range and color reproduction, and to me, they didn’t look very different from the primary lens in terms of color accuracy. Also, the software deals with the fish-eye effect quite nicely.      Samsung Galaxy S10e Camera Ultra-wide lens   1  of 12               Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide         Normal         Ultra-wide                                                Now, the main competitor of the S10e is the  Huawei P30  for now – and the advantage the P30 has over this is a dedicated “ Night mode ” which this one doesn’t have…apart from the extra  telephoto lens , of course.   However, there is a sub-menu under Scene Optimizer which lets you take images even in extreme low-light conditions. The S10e might get a Night Mode in later updates, but until then, what it has is not as good as a dedicated Night mode on the P30. We’ll compare the P30 and S10e some as well soon, so stay tuned for that!      Samsung Galaxy S10e Camera Low Light   1  of 2               Normal Low Light         Bright Light mode                  Samsung’s  Live Focus  is what makes for the portrait mode. And normal portrait images are as good as portraits go. The subject is detailed and edge detection works most times. There are also a  few bokeh effects  like Zoom, Spiral, and Monochrome. While I used the Zoom and Spiral effects very less, I liked the Monochrome a bit more. But its edge-detection needs some polishing. The good thing about its portraits is you can change the blur level and background effects after clicking the pictures as well.

Selfies are detailed and the skin tone looks almost natural. Facial features are well preserved, and the portrait selfies do a great job too, considering, there is no dedicated depth sensor. You also have a  wide-angle option  on the selfie camera which increases the field of view slightly. But without a dedicated sensor for it, I think this is just the regular camera with two different FOVs. Low light selfies are no use at all!      Samsung Galaxy S10e Selfie samples   1  of 6               Selfie         Normal selfie 1         Normal selfie 2         Portrait Selfie 1         Portrait Selfie 2         Monochrome portrait selfie                              This phone is packing the same lens as the other S10, but I couldn’t get it to record 4K video on it as others claim. There is  Full HD+ video  with a  full-fledged OIS  at work, it does a great job of stabilizing! You also get the  Super Steady mode , which uses the ultra-wide lens and captures a 1080p video, which is super smooth, but there’s no auto-focus in it.  So, in terms of cameras, Samsung delivers. But there are some aspects in which it needs work.  Performance  Moving underneath its skin, it packs the same  Exynos 9820  chip as on the other variants. Even though the Samsung Galaxy S10e is small, it does not compromise on power. And coupled with  6 GB RAM , there’s nothing it can’t handle. I don’t even think I need to talk a lot about it…everything is solid!  Here are the benchmark scores:   Geekbench 4:   Single-Core: 4378  Multi-core: 9813  Compute: 10164    AnTuTu:   325888    3DMark Sling Shot Extreme   OpenGL ES 3.1: 4397  Vulka: 4270    PC Mark   Work Performance 2.0: 7858    AndroBench   Sequential Read: 787.02 MB/s  Sequential Write: 194.06 MB/s     Gaming on it is a breeze, too! I played PUBG before it was banned, sadly. It ran on the highest of settings available, at HDR and Ultra frame rates, and there were no lags or stutters of any kind. The game-play is so smooth, that it makes you want not to stop playing at all. Other games like Asphalt 9 are also super smooth.  But one thing that got me concerned is the heating issues. There were instances it  heated up  while charging and gaming. Maybe it is to be expected of a powerful phone of such size, but sometimes, it also heated up when it was just lying idly in my pocket! I wouldn’t be so concerned if not for the  Galaxy Note 7 Battery Gate ! If you’ve faced any such issues, let us know too.  Software and UI   You know what else is hot, though? It’s Samsung’s  One UI . Based on Android Pie, this OS is a lot better than previous Samsung Experience UI. It is more user-friendly, too, and just easier to do stuff with. Some settings have changed headings, but you can easily find them with the search option.      Samsung Galaxy S10e Screenshots   1  of 7               Homecreen         Apps Edge         Apps Drawer         Multi-tasking         Notifications         Settings Toggle         Settings Menu                                 It really makes one-handed usage easier, too. You can simply swipe up or down anywhere on the screen to pull up the app drawer. You also get the sidebar for the shortcut to some apps. \xa0There’s also a lot of customizations available. Plus, the gestures are a lot easier to use… They’re just revampings of Samsung’s on-screen buttons, actually, but that makes it all the better  Battery  This part of the Samsung Galaxy S10e, however, is the deal breaker! The battery. It has a  3100 mAh battery , which, to be honest, is not enough. It is barely enough to last you through the day, and you will be looking for your charger by the end of the day.  Plus, you get  no LED notification lights , so, you kind of have to keep the  Always-On display on . And that chugs your battery even more. Now I get that the small size cannot accommodate a very large battery, but maybe just a teeny increment? I mean, this is basically a powerhouse in chains!  It does have fast charging, though. But with the  15-Watt Adaptive charging , even this small battery takes about  1 hour and 35 minutes  to fill up…which is not very impressive is it? Anyways, if you don’t mind carrying your charger around, and are not too much of a heavy user, this might not bother you.  Conclusion  Okay, what to make of the Samsung Galaxy S10e? Besides the battery, everything on this phone seems stellar, or close! And all I can say about this phone is that size doesn’t matter! All that you want – the latest of hardware, top quality display, stellar cameras are packed in this small but premium and snug body. And if you can get all of that in such a comfortable size, do you really need to go big that won’t even fit in your pocket?   And that brings me to another question – with flagships getting bigger and more expensive, are these semi-flagship phones starting to make more sense? I mean, if you look at  Huawei P30 Pro  and P30, the latter packs much of the same stuff in a smaller and more affordable body as well. And it seems to me that these are the better value for money devices.  Moreover, this phone is really an answer to the  iPhone XR , and while the XR may beat it in performance, the S10e leaves the XR in the water, in other aspects. Top of the line AMOLED displays and 2 cameras are enough to make a gap between those two devices. However, there are other phones like the  Xiaomi Mi 9  with similar hardware, AMOLED display, and similar camera for a much lesser price. And probably the OnePlus 7 will surely be a better value for money.  But would I recommend this? For a difference of $150 in price with the S10, it has its fair share of compromises. One less camera, small battery and a slightly lesser build. But while I think the S10 is a great phone, you won’t go wrong with this  $750 semi-flagship phone  either. Especially, when you get  great offers on it in Nepal !  Pros:   Nice compact design  Good build quality  Stellar Performance  Highly optimized UI   Cons:   Poor battery life  Price could have been better']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review.jpg']

['Nepal’s space dream is finally true but there is still a lot to be done'],['Satellite'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 21, 2019']",2019-04-21 05:33:22+00:00,"['On Thursday morning, at 2:31 AM NST, as a lot of Nepali people were in their deep sleep, an Antares rocket carrying a lot of cargo launched up into space. This spacecraft holds a special Nepali dream as it is carrying Nepal’s first ever  satellite  – NepaliSat-1.  The nano-satellite went up into space from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, USA. It will reach the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday.  A nano-satellite is a satellite that weighs somewhere between 1 kg to 10 kg. NepaliSat-1 has a weight of 1.3 kg and is cube-shaped. Scientists hold plans to release the satellite into the lower orbit of ISS in the second week of June.        NepaliSat-1 has been developed by two Nepali scientists, Hariram Shrestha, and Aabhas Maskey, under the investment of Nepali Academy of Science and Technology (NAST), and the help of other scientists. This tech was developed under the BIRDS project of Japanese Kyushu Institute of Technology. The BIRDS project is its collaboration with the United Nations. It basically holds the objective of helping various countries develop and launch their first satellite.  In his tweet, Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli was quick to praise the scientists and institutions that were involved in the feat.   Though a humble beginning, with the launching of NepaliSat-1 Nepal has entered the Space-Era. I wish to congratulate all those scientists and institutions that were involved right from the development to its launching thereby enhancing the prestige of our country.  pic.twitter.com/PpF1PIcQfa  — K P Sharma Oli (@kpsharmaoli)  April 18, 2019   The cargo spacecraft is also carrying satellites made by Japanese and Sri Lankan scientists along with supplies and gears for the crew residing in the ISS.  NepaliSat-1 has been built mainly for two major sectors among others – Remote Sensing, and Communication. With the help of a multispectral camera, the remote sensing system will capture photos in RGB color from 400 km away. Likewise, for communication, it will gather data related to Nepal’s temperature, water level, soil, humidity, and SOS. The collected data will be sent to NAST’s Ground Station which is currently under construction.   Talking to the BBC Nepali Service, Aabhas Maskey said, “This has been possible due to the investment from the Nepal Government. We still face the challenge of running a satellite for a longer period of time. This is our first step.  He also added that there is still a lot of work to be done to make huge strides in the satellite technology for Nepal.  Since it’s a nano-satellite, NepaliSat-1 won’t remain in the space for long. Maskey has predicted it to stay in space for 3 months to a year.  For Nepal to actually run a satellite that actually stays in the space for a long period of time, investment from all sectors is necessary. The government should also work to produce a workforce meant for the purpose. There also is a necessity of building the essential science an technology to run and make satellites from Nepal itself.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nepalisat-1-launched.jpg']
['Vivo V15 review: Overshadowed by the better sibling'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Vivo']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['April 20, 2019']",2019-04-20 12:46:06+00:00,"['The pop-up selfie camera is quite on trend. The technology debuted last year on the flagship  Vivo Nex . With pop-up selfie camera on the board, the phone lacks any sort of bezels, notches or hole punch cutouts. And such type of An immersive display definitely looks attractive. However, the phone didn’t land in Nepal. So we were unable to feel the tech and test the device. But recently, Vivo launched the mid-range phone with an elevating selfie camera. When it launched it was one of the very first phones in Nepal with such type of feature. The elevating selfie camera definitely looks fancy. But other than that, what does the phone packs inside. And how does it fares in real-life use? Let’s find out in this Vivo V15 review.   Vivo V15 Specifications:   Display: \xa06.53 inches IPS LCD screen with FHD+ resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Platform: \xa0Android 9.0 Pie with Funtouch 9  CPU:\xa0 MediaTek Helio P70  Back camera: \xa012 MP f/1.8 + 8 MP f/2.2 (13 mm ultra-wide sensor), 5 MP f/2.4 depth sensor  Front camera: \xa032MP motorized pop-up camera  Video: \xa01080p@30\xa0fps,\xa02160@30\xa0fps  RAM: \xa06 GB RAM  ROM:  128 GB; expandable up to 256 GB (dedicated slot)  Battery: \xa0Non-removable Li-Po 4000 mAh battery, Micro USB with Dual-engine fast charging  Sensors: \xa0Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass, gyro  SIM (s): \xa0Single SIM (Nano-SIM) or Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by)  Connections: \xa0Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, WiFi Direct, and hotspot  Colors: \xa0Topaz Blue, Glamour Red  Price: Rs.  45,190  41,990 (new price)   Design  As usual, let’s start with the design. The design is more or less like the  Vivo V15 Pro , except for a fingerprint sensor at the rear side. You get a vertical camera setup tucked neatly inside a black surface that creates a noticeable bump while placed on a plane surface.         By looks, this gradient Blue color seems good to the eyes but the phone does feel very heavy on the hands. However, the weight seems evenly distributed in all parts, so the phone does not feel hollow.  The device comes pre-attached with a screen protector, it is not noticeable though. This is a very nice touch because there are many people out there, who do not like putting a tempered glass on the phones’ screens.   However, the buttons are not tactile enough to my liking. And talking about buttons, you also get a dedicated button for Google assistant that comes handy only when you get used to it. But, you don’t have any option to remap to other apps.  And just above it, you have the SIM slots alongside a dedicated Micro SD card slot.  The material on this one looks like Glass, but this is plastic, unfortunately. The problem with glass looking plastic backs is they tend to start pigmenting even when you use it with covers. On the brighter side, this is something Vivo can take as feedback and get it right the next time.  Display  Upfront, you have a 6.53-inches IPS LCD display that looks quite good. Of course, when you place it beside the Super AMOLED display of the Vivo V15 pro, you can spot the difference right away. But for the display this one is, we can’t call it bad. Outdoor too it fares quite well and you get quite the brightness. There are minimum bezels around the screen except for the chin.   But then again, the company has put in a lot of efforts in making this screen look like it’s bezel-less however, if the chin would have been a little smaller, the display would look even better.  And if you ask me about the quality of the display, as I said earlier, I would say it’s nothing to complain about. You get a vibrant one here and it’s large, so watching movies or playing games has been quite an experience. And while playing PUBG you get enough space for you to rest your fingers without obstructing the game. Viewing angles are great and you will love the display overall.  Camera  It’s a Vivo smartphone we are talking about, so explaining about the cameras in detail is a must. The phone has a 12 MP primary camera, an 8 MP secondary Ultra-wide-angle lens followed by a 5 MP depth sensor. And as the specs go, the images follow the similar performance. They look good and have good color reproduction if not the most accurate.        1  of 5                                                                    But one thing I have noticed having used the ‘Pro version’ too is that because it uses  pixel binning  to give 12MP shots, the pictures are much much better on the higher end variant.  Back to talking about the V15’s cameras, the pictures are bright and vibrant, no doubts on that, but when you zoom in, the details are just average. But in the perfect light, you can get some dope pictures.  The ultra-wide-angle lens is something you can brag about in this smartphone. Sometimes the wide-angle shots have better colors than the normal ones, which was surprising but its a welcome feature. And I also compared some of those wide-angle shots with the  Galaxy A50  and found the V15’s camera to have better details and colors. So, the secondary lens does justice to the cameras.

It misses out on edge detection part most of the times and although the different portrait lighting effects seem fun, they have been inconsistent on my use.  A perfect example of this is the Monochrome effect which has only worked like 2 times on my use, other times it has failed to deliver! And other than the rainbow effect, there is no particular difference between other options, except for some changes in the skin tone.        1  of 5               Portrait Mode (Studio)         Portrait Mode (Stereo)         Portrait Mode (Rainbow)         Portrait Mode (Monochrome)         Portrait Mode (Monochrome)                           Having said that you have options to adjust the background blur after taking pictures like the  Vivo V11  and even the  V9 , so nothing head-turning here as well.  The pictures in artificial lighting turn out good. They look nice to the eyes and have good details. There is also a dedicated night mode here that uses a long exposure, which works to preserve some details but nothing to go on about. Normal nighttime pictures have grains to them and look no good.      Normal Mode     Night Mode   Selfies appear nice from the 32MP pop-up camera. It is very fancy taking selfies in public because people look at the phone and make a perplexed expression looking at the alleviating camera which has been fun for me.  The selfies are bright and colorful and on par with what we expect from a Vivo smartphone. I would not say that the skin tone is the most natural, but they do not look bad if you ask me.        1  of 8                                                                                                  There’s the infamous beauty mode too which is aggressive only if set to the highest numbers. Other times, if you get almost natural looking selfies. And as mentioned in the impressions video, there are tons of photoshop features in this one, which may come to the liking for many people.  There are portrait selfie features too, just like the main camera and the pictures look beautified to some extent, not sure why and how but I am pretty sure I turned off the beauty mode while taking those selfies.        1  of 3               Vivo V15 go pop camera         Vivo V15 rear camera         Pop Up Camera On Resting Position                     I have also compared the selfies of the A50 and V15 and while the details are preserved well in the V15, the A50 has a much natural looking color.  For high-res images,  Click Here .  Performance  Okay, let’s go to the performance side of things. This phone uses the  Helio P70  and 6GB RAM to power itself and does a pretty good job. It is definitely an upgrade over last year. The same chipset is also there on the  OPPO F11 Pro  and it’s going to be an interesting battle as to which phone has optimized it better.  On to real life performance, with this one you can play PUBG on medium settings in HD in high frame rate settings pretty smoothly. There are minor stutters and slight drops in frame rated that will go unnoticed. Plus, the display is large and the control buttons don’t obstruct your gaming experience.  Normal to even heavy tasks run well but messenger on top of heavy games makes the phone panic sometimes. Other than that, multitasking has been smooth, app opening is fast and switching in between apps is fairly smooth.  Vivo V15 Benchmarks   AnTuTu v7 : 143,452  CPU : 61967,  GPU : 33668,  UX : 37715,  Memory : 10102    AndroBench :  Sequential Read : 307.35 MB/s,  Sequential Write : 179.11 MB/s    Geekbench 4   Single-core : 1542,  Multi-core : 5751,  RenderScript Score : 5253    PC Mark   Work 2.0 : 8226    3D Mark   Slighshot Extreme Vulkan:  1253     Software  On to the software, this one comes with Android 9 Pie which is pretty standard in 2019. I have received altogether three updates during my time with the phone which I appreciate. But what I don’t appreciate is the Funtouch OS that’s there on this phone.  The major problems I have with it are: 1. The upward swiping taskbar. 2. Those cartoonish and large weird looking icons.        1  of 3               Cartoonish Icons         swipe up menu         Bloatwares                     Users have no control over the taskbar settings. However, what you can do is change the theme and make the icons look a bit better. And there is a search button inside the settings menu now which has made using this phone easier in comparison to its predecessors.  But one thing is, as long as I have used the phone, I still get confused on whether to swipe down or up for the taskbar and I really hope Vivo brings an update to change that or get it right the next time.  Battery  The battery on the V15 is a bigger 4,000 mAh and this is one of the things that sets it apart from the pro model. Although the battery has to power an IPS display which consumes more power, I am very well satisfied with the back up it gave me.  I am a pretty heavy user with most of my day spent on YouTube and Facebook and Gaming. And even so, the device held up very well for an entire day. On normal usage, the days that don’t involve much gaming, the battery even lasted for more than a day.  And the phone is enabled with an 18-Watt fast charging that does not take even 2 hours to get your phone fully charged which is a bonus if you ask me.  But, the Micro USB port is a minus to the device. Last year, we had the same story and even now, in 2019, there is the same thing all over again. I think there are some things that companies need to understand themselves, things about being updated to trends, things about evolving!  Security & Audio  Now let’s talk about the fingerprint sensor. It is fast and accurate gets it correct 9 out of 10 times.  Strangely, There is no Facial Unlock feature though but it’s okay considering the selfie camera pops out each time you look at the Vivo V15 pro and that was annoying. Also, this phone does not miss out on the headphone jack so this one’s a plus. The single firing speaker at the bottom does an average job.  Conclusion  So, my conclusion about the phone is, this one looks good overall. Except for the UI, I have no complaints what so ever. Having said that a price of Rs. 45,190 in Nepal, it is a bit too much.   I mean, you can get the 128GB version of the  Huawei P30 Lite  or the  Galaxy A50  for less price. And even if you are into Pop-up camera and love VIVO, you should get the Pro version that comes with a Super AMOLED display, superior Snapdragon 675 processor, and better cameras.  Honestly, with the Vivo V15, you are paying the extra price for the pop-up camera! And until and unless, you don’t absolutely want that, I think the device is asking for a little premium price than it should.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vivo-v15-review.jpg']

The phone packs a pair of cameras on the back. And the primary shooter here employs the  12MP  Sony IMX 486 sensor , which does a decent job. The secondary shooter employs a  5MP depth sensor . When both cameras come active, they can capture portrait images as well. Talking about the selfie shooter, a  13MP lens  remains embedded in the notch up top.  Talking about the battery, there is a massive  5000mAh non-removable battery . With such an enormous battery on the board, the device stays alive for a considerate amount of time.

['Samsung Galaxy Fold – The future seems fragile'],['Samsung'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['April 19, 2019']",2019-04-19 11:30:35+00:00,"['So after a lot speculating and waiting, foldable phones became a reality with the  Royale Flex Pai  coming out first. And then, it was the  Huawei Mate X  that showed up. Shortly thereafter,  Samsung Galaxy Fold  made its presence known, and probably, that was the most anticipated folding smartphone ever. And it was one of the futures of smartphones it seems. But with reports that the Galaxy Fold is unfolding its durability issues, the future seems fragile!  I don’t want to be too dramatic about this. But what happened to it, for such an expensive phone is, kind of, a cause for alarm. Some reviewers, reportedly, faced screen issues. And by issues, I mean, rendering the displays useless. Reviewers like  MKBHD ,  Dieter Bohn of   The Verge ,  Steve Kovach of   CNBC , and  Mark Gurman of Bloomberg  faced such issues. And that happened in two different ways.      Samsung Galaxy Fold breaks for reviewers   1  of 2               Source: Twitter / MKBHD         Source: Twitter / Mark Gurman                  First was, what can be considered a user error. There is a thin  plastic film on the inner foldable display  of the Galaxy Fold that not only protects its display but is actually the part of it. And while the retail units do have a warning on the packaging telling users not to remove it, the ones reviewers received did not have it. So, like any other sensible person, they removed the film, mistaking it for a screen protector of sorts. Also, that is one easy mistake to make. Immediately after removing it, they began to face problems, and the displays became useless.         Another kind of problem, happened, on its own apparently.\xa0By which, I mean, no removing of the coating was involved. But there is also a small gap underneath the plastic coating right at the hinge, through which dust or air can enter easily. And maybe due to that, the displays stopped working.  After these incidents went public,  Samsung did release a statement  which claimed they would investigate the problem. In addition, it is also a warning about not to remove the coating after purchase. Now, of course, what’s happened has happened. There are no two ways about it. For consumers, Samsung might replace the faulty units, while other retailers like AT&T and T-Mobile claim to be making contingency plans for consumers.  Nevertheless, this is, as I said, raises some concern. For such a highly anticipated device and an expensive one at that, to break so easily is something else entirely. Sure, this is a first-generation device. The very first foldable phone for Samsung. So, there are bound to be trials-and-errors and those sort of things. But, maybe, is there a possibility that, in a hurry to get a foldable phone out, did Samsung produce something half-baked?  You be the judge. Do let us know your thoughts, if you have any, on this. Also, would you, if you get to buy a foldable phone, go for it?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-fold.jpg']

For a price of  Rs.13490 , it is slightly more expensive than the Galaxy M10. And for that price, it seems to have a bit of improvement as well as downgrades.   Samsung Galaxy A10 Overview:  Samsung’s old days of the J-series and On-series were pretty confusing. There were tons of phones and people had a hard time deciding which one to get. With the new A-series and M-series fiasco, we thought it was over. Well, guess what? It’s not! Originally the A-series was intended for mid-range phones. But with the likes of Galaxy A80 coming out, it moved to premium mid-range as well. And now with the Samsung Galaxy A10, it’s moving to budget as well? Now, this is definitely a head-scratcher.        Anyways, let’s talk about the Galaxy A10. It is a budget phone, and hence has a plastic body, on which, you get a  6.2″ IPS LCD screen  with an  HD+ display . Also, it has the same  19:9 aspect ratio  with the V-shaped notch. So, this is Samsung’s Infinity-V display.  It is strange that this one gets only a single camera at the back while the M10 features a dual one. So, it misses out on the ultra-wide-angle lens, which is a downgrade for the device. Also, the primary camera is a  13 MP lens  while the selfie camera is a  5 MP  one.   The performance side is what sees an improvement, however. An  octa-core Exynos 7884 chipset  powers the phone, with  2 GB RAM . 7884 is a slight improvement over the 7870 of the Galaxy M10. In terms of battery, it has a similar  3400 mAh battery  and there seems to be no Fast Charging. Also, it has  32 GB storage , which is expandable. In addition, it does come with  One UI  based on Android Pie out of the box.

Shortly after,  Huawei P30 Pro  took a leap and regained the unrivaled top spot with 112 points. But Samsung didn’t remain behind much longer. When the DxOmark tested the Galaxy S10 5G, it granted 112 points for the camera prowess of the phone. And with that score, the Galaxy S10 5G is jointly on the top spot alongside the P30 Pro.  The regular Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus had with a 12MP wide-angle lens, 16MP ultra-wide angle, and a 12MP telephoto lens. The S10 5G, however, has an additional ToF sensor due to which it enjoys a quad-camera setup on the back. With triple cameras, S10/S10+ had score 109 points. So is it the extra ToF lens that has added full three points in the scorebook? Well, no. DxOmark has explicitly said that they do not value the ToF lens. So what made the differences then you might wonder. Well, it’s the software. DxOmark’s website has clearly said that the software on the units they test can be different from the units on sale. And the software here clearly looks better than that on the S10/S10+. So Samsung could roll out an OTA update to make the necessary amendments on camera’s software part.

The South Korean tech giant has yet again released two new phones and this time on China. The new handsets to make a debut in China are Galaxy A60 and Galaxy A40s.  Samsung Galaxy A60 Overview  Last year, Samsung launched the  Galaxy A8s  in China, which was the first Samsung smartphone to feature a hole-punch cutout. Samsung likes to call it “Infinity-O display” by the way. And this time, Samsung announced the Galaxy A60 for China, which also comes with a similar kind of  hole-punch display .  Samsung’s hole punch display on the  Galaxy S10 devices  has garnered quite a number of fans. And this time Samsung brought the display tech in a midrange phone, which is quite commendable. The display on this device comes with a  6.3-inch IPS LCD panel  comprising of a whopping  91.8% of screen to body ratio . On the resolution side, the phone gets the  Full-HD+ resolution  in 19.5:9 aspect ratio.         To achieve such a high screen to body ratio, Samsung gave away the earpiece. Samsung has equipped  body sound casting technology  with which the sound propagates through the screen. And during the calls, the voice from the other side is audible through the screen. This is quite a fancy tech, which is seen on the flagship devices like the  Huawei P30 Pro ,  Vivo Apex 2019 , etc.  Lately, Samsung is being quite generous on the performance side. And the Galaxy A60 is no exception. The phone comes with the  Snapdragon 675 chipset , which is also found on the more premium  Galaxy A70  and the  Vivo V15 Pro . And to aid the performance, Samsung has included  6GB of RAM  in its arsenal. Talking about the storage, the phone flaunts  128GB of onboard memory , which can be expanded up to 512GB. And Samsung has employed a  dedicated SD card slot  for that.   Even on the camera front, the Samsung Galaxy A60 looks enticing. The phone enjoys a triple camera setup at the back, which is a combination of  32MP main camera  accompanied by an  8MP ultra-wide-angle  shooter and a  5MP depth sensor . On the front, there is a  32MP camera  to handle the selfie business.  The phone is fueled by a  3500mAh battery  with support for  15-watt fast charging . On to the software, the boots on  Android Pie  out of the box with  One UI  on the top.

This cues that Samsung has no plans to bring the M-series products to China.  The Galaxy A40s comes with a  6.4-inch Super AMOLED . But unlike the Galaxy A60, this one comes with a U-shaped notch in a tiny water drop style shape. The notch houses a  16MP camera , which can be brought to action while taking selfies and unlocking the device with Face Unlock feature. And talking about the cameras on the back, the A40s also holds a camera triplet on the rear panel. The  primary 13MP camera  does the normal photo/video shooting, whereas the  5MP ultra-wide-angle lens  comes into action to expand the field of view. The third  5MP depth sensor  pulls in depth information while capturing the portrait/Live Focus images.   The phone is powered with  Exynos 7904 chipset . It gets  6GB RAM  and  64GB of onboard storage  on the memory side of things. The phone also flaunts a dedicated SD card slot, which aids to expand the memory without sacrificing the SIM2 slot.  The battery is the major highlight of the phone. The  5000mAh battery  on the device is quite a powerhouse. Plus it features a  15-watt charging technology  due to which the device gets refueled fairly quickly.

The launch of the device outside of China is also a matter of concern and there is no information about that either. However, the pricing of the device has been announced.   The Galaxy A60, the better of the two is priced at  CNY 1,999 ($300/€265) . The Galaxy A40s, on the other hand, will cost  CNY 1,499 ($225/€200)  in China when it goes on sale.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-a60-a40s.jpg']
['Huawei Y7 Pro 2019 Review: An Underrated Budget Phone?'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['April 17, 2019']",2019-04-17 12:51:04+00:00,"['Huawei has added to its budget lineup another smartphone, the Huawei Y7 Pro 2019. This device seems like a design-centric smartphone and to many, it may seem so by its looks. Other than design, what fancy features have the smartphone packed inside it? Let’s find that out in this Huawei Y7 Pro 2019 Review.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-XDULBYaN4  Huawei Y7 Pro 2019 Specifications:   Display : 6.26″ IPS LCD HD+ display with (1520 x 720 pixel resolution) and 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Dual, 13 MP primary sensor with f/1.8 aperture and 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : 16 MP camera  Chipset: \xa0Snapdragon 450  CPU : Octa-core 1.8 GHz  GPU : Adreno 506  RAM : 3 GB  Storage : 32 GB (expandable via microSD up to 512 GB)  Battery : 4000 mAh  Connectivity : Dual SIM, 2.4GHz WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, micro USB 2.0  OS : Android 8.1 Oreo with EMUI 8.2  Price : Rs. 18,490   Design  The Huawei Y7 Pro 2019 at first glance looks very appealing. It has sleek plastic construction, no doubts on that, but considering the price, you get quite a deal. The gradient back here is eye-candy and the Blue color stands out from the rest effortlessly. The design looks minimalistic, with very few elements at the back. However, the Huawei branding on the front doesn’t look quite convincing since there is also another one on the back. Maybe to utilize the chin at the bottom!            Back     Charging Port     Headphone Jack     Huawei Y7 Pro 2019 Buttons     SIM Card Port   You get all your buttons on the right which are decently tactile, dual bottom firing speakers and a headphone jack at the top. While this might seem like an unusual placement, you get used to it pretty easily. The speaker grill at the top is also the house for an LED indicator which is a little dim to my liking.  Having said that, the phone does not feel that cheap on hands and as I said earlier does not look inexpensive either. Huawei seems to have worked its way through pretty well here.  Display  The display is 6.26 inches in measurement with HD+ resolution and though it does not particularly stand out, it is not bad. There is a U-shaped notch up front which, for some reason covers some area than it should. Nonetheless, it’s a big and colorful display with ample brightness even outdoors.   Only while watching YouTube videos, the display seems to lack the punch but maybe that’s because we are from the Full-HD displays. Otherwise, this one gets on pretty well, especially on normal usage. And like every phone on today’s date, this IPS panel has good viewing angles too. So, in the overall, this display is okay at best for the price tag.  Cameras  Being a budget-oriented phone, we were quite concerned about the camera abilities of the phone. However, the phone performed decently well in our camera test. Talking about the camera hardware, this one follows the trend of having dual cameras with it’s 13 MP and 2 MP sensors at the back. And as mentioned earlier, this one is surprisingly good.        1  of 13                                                                                                                                                    Although the details are quite lacking, Colors pops out in the captured images. And that’s okay as long as the pictures look good to the eyes.  Having said that the camera does struggle for a while to focus on objects. But the end result is always good in good lighting conditions. Portrait shots look decent too. You don’t get proper edge separation though! Have a look at these samples here and be the judge yourself.      Portrait Mode   1  of 5                                                                    Likewise, the HDR option is something that could improve in future generations as there is barely any noticeable difference with it turned on and off. There is also an AI option that does very subtle color changes in pictures.             In low lighting conditions, however, you will get muddy images. For a budget phone, that’s understandable, so let’s not go on about it.      Normal Selfie     Normal Selfie     Normal Selfie     Selfie in Artificial Light     Low Light Selfie   The selfies, on the other hand, are good and detailed with its 16MP sensor. They are colorful and natural too. There is no selfie portrait feature though, which might let down some expectations.  For all the high-quality samples\xa0 click here  Performance  The performance in Y7 Pro 2019 is backed by the SD 450, which is an upgrade over last year’s Snapdragon 430, but it is still an okay performer. The phone’s performance is moderate in terms of app opening and even while switching between them. PUBG is playable in low settings with stutters time and again. Low end to mid-tier games run well on this device. But on normal use, there isn’t much to complain.  You get 32 GB internal memory for use that is expandable up to 512 GB but in order to do so, you will have to sacrifice on a SIM slot. The available 3GB RAM is quite a standard for the price being asked, so it’s well and good!   But a huge downside to this device is the absence of a fingerprint sensor. In 2019, it kinda feels strange not having it on your phone. There is also a facial unlock feature, which is a bit slow but gets it correct most of the times.  So, the performance side of it just average, and what competitors are offering in this price range, I hope Huawei will improve in coming generations.  Huawei Y7 Pro 2019 Benchmarks   AnTuTu v7 : 73,842  AndroBench :  Sequential Read : 295.59 MB/s,  Sequential Write : 85.02 MB/s    Geekbench 4   Single-core : 763,  Multi-core : 3726    PC Mark   Work 2.0 : 4617    3D Mark   Slighshot Extreme Vulkan:  487  Slighshot Extreme OpenGL ES:  438     Software  On the software side, there is Android Oreo out of the box with Huawei’s custom skin EMUI 8.2 on the top. Since most of the smartphones in 2019 comes with Android Pie, it is quite a bummer to see the Android Oreo here. Even the cheaper  Y6 Pro 2019  comes with Android Pie so Huawei’s strategy here doesn’t look quite plausible. Nonetheless, Huawei said to roll out an update for this device very soon. So there is nothing to worry yet.      Home Screen     Notification Shades     Recent Apps   Talking about the EMUI, there are tons of bloatware like most of Huawei phones. Some of them can be uninstalled or disabled but most of them cannot be uninstalled. Since the phone has merely 32GB of RAM, the presence of bloatware reduces the available storage. Other than that, there is nothing much to discuss on the software front. So let’s move forward.  Battery:  This device, if nothing else, excels in the battery department. The 4,000 mAh battery does hold up well for 2 days in a row on normal usage. Watching videos and playing games do drain it a bit faster, but even so, you get over one day of battery, which is commendable. Of course, the HD display has a huge role to play in this! However, what’s painful is the charging time which goes up to more than 2.5 hours.  Conclusion:  So, for Rs. 18,490 you get a decent phone in the form of Y7 Pro 2019. It has a good set of cameras, a very good design, and great battery backup. And actually, the phone is priced pretty competitively in Nepal. So, in Nepal, this device is a decent deal to look at all thanks to the competition!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/huawei-y7-pro-2019-review.jpg']

The new Galaxy A2 Core looks and feels very much like it’s predecessor, but there are a few subtle improvements. Since it’s not like a headline-making phone, the launch was very subtle.  Samsung Galaxy A2 Core Overview   The A2 Core looks and feels very much like its predecessor. Nothing bezel-less, or one with a notch. Just your regular old-fashioned bezels and small screen and stuff. You get a plastic body with removable back. All the makings of your old-fashioned phone.        This phone has  5″ screen  with an  IPS LCD panel . That is an improvement over the TFT display of the J2 Core. Still, the screen resolution is the same, with the same aspect ratio. The camera sees a downgrade, though, as it is  5 MP  for both the front and rear. This phone runs on the  Exynos 7870  with  1 GB RAM  and up to  16 GB storage . But there is a microSD card slot in there as well. Also, there’s a  2600 mAh battery  powering it and there’s also a headphone jack.  This phone runs on the  Android Pie  variant of  Go edition .

There’s also an 8 GB version. The 16GB of Samsung Galaxy A2 core is available in Nepal for Rs. 8,499.  So, for those who are limited by their budget, this runs the latest software.

['Vivo Y17 surfaces with a triple rear cameras and a massive battery'],['Vivo'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 16, 2019']",2019-04-16 11:52:32+00:00,"['Vivo’s Y-series of smartphones are usually budget-oriented. They are not quite popular as the V-series handsets but they have made a good mark, especially on the budget segment. And according to the new leaks, Vivo is expanding its Y-series lineup. Although the initial leaks cued the upcoming Y-series devices to launch with Y5 and Y3 and model name, the new leaks have something different to say. The upcoming Vivo phone will come as Vivo Y17 and feature a triple camera setup at its back.  Vivo Y17 Specifications (Leaked)  In terms of design, the phone looks more or less similar to the last year’s  Vivo Y91 . With dual-tone gradient finish on the back and a tiny water-drop notch on the top, Y17 shares an uncanny resemblance with the Y91. Although the V-series handsets leaped forward with the pop-up style selfie camera, we won’t be getting that here. The selfie shooter will dwell on a  6.35-inch screen  and will make use of a  20MP sensor . The front camera is also said to come with AI capabilities.  But unlike the Y91, the phone enjoys triple rear cameras. However, there is no information regarding the resolution of the sensor and the type of lens used. But we can expect it to be a combination of a wide-angle lens, an ultra-wide-angle lens, and a depth sensor just like on the  Vivo V15  and  V15 Pro . And the triple rear camera setup will also be enriched with  Artificial Intelligence .         On the performance side, there will be  MediaTek Helio P35 chipset . And there will be  4GB of RAM  to aid in multitasking. Talking about the internal memory, there will be  128GB of onboard storage  to store all sort of files and photos.  The battery has to be the USP of the phone. We have seen Vivo pushing the battery capacity up to 4030mAh on the Y91. But this time Vivo went one step further and included a massive  5000mAh battery . And to make the charging process hassle-free, Vivo has also bundled  Dual Engine fast charging technology .  Pre-order and Launch date  A poster from Indonesia highlights some major specs of the device. Apart from that, the poster has also clearly written the pre-order date of the device in the country. The device will be available for pre-order starting from  18 th  of April  and will last till the  30 th . Pre-bookers will also be getting a  Bluetooth headset for free .  The device was also rumored to launch in India really soon. Indian Premier League (IPL) is also taking place in India, where Vivo is the title sponsor. So IPL seems like a good platform to unveil the device and Vivo could do the same. If that happens, launch on India and Indonesia may occur around the same time.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vivo-y17-specifications.jpg']

Both of the devices carry top-tier specs. But mainly their cameras steal the limelight. But seems like Google is going with a new strategy this time around. The search engine giant might bring an affordable version of the Pixel devices this year to mark its spot in the midrange territory. And their yet unannounced  Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL  are creating quite a lot of buzz lately. Also, out of nowhere Google also teased that it will be launching a  new Pixel product on 7 th  of May . Connecting these two dots, many of us are expecting new affordable Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL devices to launch in that event.  Google teased the event with  “On May 7, something big is coming to the Pixel universe” . May 7 is the first day of this year’s I/O developer conference in Mountain View. So there are many things, which Google could possibly bring in the limelight. But since Google has specifically mentioned “Pixel Universe”, the one clear idea that comes to the mind is the Pixel phones. However, the next flagship devices in Google’s lineup (possibly  Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL ) are due to launch in October. So there are many possibilities of Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL to make a debut then.  Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL Specifications (Leaked)  There have already been a fair number of speculations regarding the Pixel 3a and 3a XL. Google is expected to differentiate the two devices primarily through the screen sizes. And in that case, the smaller 3a is rumored to pack a  5.6-inch display  whereas the bigger one will sport a  6.0-inch panel . Both of these devices will come with an  OLED panel  enriched with  Full-HD+ resolution .        Camera has always been the strong suit of the Pixel phones and that’s expected to continue in these new midrange phones. And there have also been a fair number of speculations that the device with the same  12MP rear camera  found the flagship duo. If that comes true then it could surely be the best camera phone in the midrange territory.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyJwQwSpgWM  On the performance side, Pixel 3a could come with  Snapdragon 670 chipset  whereas the XL variant will get the  Snapdragon 710 . Both of these devices are supposed to come with  4GB of RAM . But again, these are just the speculations. Since Snapdragon has recently announced some capable midrange chipsets like  Snapdragon 665, 730 and 730G , Google can also make use of any of these chips. We should probably have to wait till the launch date for the confirmation.  In terms of build, these midrange Google phones are expected to come with the  plastic back . But since the design will be identical to the last year’s flagship. In these upcoming phones, Google is also said to rejuvenate the  3.5mm audio jack . So it might as well please the audiophiles.  Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL Price  An article had also surfaced on the internet regarding the pricing of the Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL. In the post, the smaller variant (Sargo) was said to cost  CAD $649 , which translates to  €430/$490 . Similarly, Bonito (Pixel 3a XL) is said to demand a price of  CAD $799  (approximately  €530/$600 ).   The pricing for both of these devices is for the 4/64GB variant of the phone. Since there is no news regarding other memory variants of the phone. So it there might be a single memory configuration on both of these devices.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/google-pixel-event-may-7.jpg']
['AMD just sold more desktop processors than Intel – Here is why!'],"['Processors', 'AMD', 'Intel']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['April 15, 2019']",2019-04-15 12:17:13+00:00,"['There are two brands synonymous with desktop processors, Intel and AMD. Both offer a number of great chipsets, some offer good value, some not so much. Intel has always been criticized as overpriced, but better performers. On the other end, AMD has been quoted “bang for your buck” multiple times and is a favorite among content creators. With that said, there is no surprise which one shipped more products in the last couple of years.  Thanks to numerous price cuts on multiple chipsets and Intel’s supply problems, AMD just managed to double market share. First, let’s clear a few things up, Intel CPUs aren’t exactly inferior to that of AMD. Because Intel cannot push out enough of its 14nm based chipsets, which affects both of it’s “Xeon” and “Core” lineup, there has been a few consequences. First of which is a hike in prices.         The already expensive chipsets are now receiving price hikes, and that’s not a good thing. What makes it even worse? AMD has been slicing off the prices from it’s already “value for money” products, and you probably get what I am saying. Increase in demand and decrease in supply will eventually result in price hikes. But when that happens, the demand actually decreases, and everyone moves to the next best thing.  Addressing this issue, Intel has started taking steps in order to fix this current situation. Here is the press release from Intel:  The surprising return to PC TAM growth has put pressure on our factory network. We’re prioritizing the production of Intel Xeon and Intel Core processors so that collectively we can serve the high-performance segments of the market.  That said, supply is undoubtedly tight, particularly at the entry-level of the PC market. We continue to believe we will have at least the supply to meet the full-year revenue outlook we announced in July, which was $4.5 billion higher than our January expectations.  To address this challenge, we’re taking the following actions:   We are investing a record $15 billion in capital expenditures in 2018, up approximately $1 billion from the beginning of the year. We’re putting that $1 billion into our 14nm manufacturing sites in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland, and Israel. This capital along with other efficiencies is increasing our supply to respond to your increased demand.  We’re making progress with 10nm. Yields are improving and we continue to expect volume production in 2019.  We are taking a customer-first approach. We’re working with your teams to align demand with available supply. You can expect us to stay close, listen, partner and keep you informed.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intel-Processor.jpg']

The gaming laptops maker has a wide range of laptops. And did you know they make professional laptops too? I mean, those meant for work and editing stuff, rather than just gaming. Many did not, of course. Anyway, they are launching two new laptops from their MSI Prestige PS42 Modern lineup in Nepal, along with another gaming laptop.  Their Prestige lineup is meant primarily for people on the go. And this lineup comprises of slim and elegant devices – not your typical heavy gaming rigs. Ocean Computers, the authorized distributors of MSI products in Nepal have launched two Prestige laptops\xa0 –  PS42 Modern 8RA  and  Prestige PS42 Modern 8MO .  MSI Prestige PS42 Modern 8RA Overview  The PS42 Modern 8RA has a slim and lightweight chassis in an all silver color that weighs about  1.19 kg . It features a  14-inch Full-HD IPS LCD  panel with very narrow bezels. There’s a Full-sized keyboard for better work as well. The laptop runs on  8th-gen Intel Whiskey Lake i7-8565U processor  with a boost clock up to  4.6 GHz .         \xa0  Combined with its  16 GB DDR4 RAM , your daily workflow should get on without a hitch. Plus, you also get  MX250 graphics …which might be an entry level card but works for light gaming and editing stuff. And that’s what it is meant for anyway. For storage, you get a  512 GB NVMe SSD , so there’s no questioning its performance either. It also packs a  50 Watt-hour battery , and with its configuration, it should last up to 10 hours.  You get  2 USB-Cs ,  two USB-As , an SD card slot, and an HDMI port for I / O interfaces. This laptop is priced at  Rs.149,000 .  MSI Prestige PS42 Modern 8MO Overview  Another variant of the PS42 Modern 8RA is the 8MO. There are only a few differences between these two models. The primary one being the absence of a dedicated graphics card. Also, you only get the i5 variant, here in Nepal even though you can get an i7 version overseas.  The PS42 Modern 8MO packs a  14-inch Full-HD display  as well. It also has a full sized keyboard and weighs about  1.18 kg .

And the answer to that is…soon. The Realme 3 Pro is the successor to the  Realme 2 Pro , which was very well received. And this one, the  Realme 3 Pro , comes at just the right time to give the  Redmi Note 7 Pro  some competition! Who knows? Maybe they launched the phone to do just that?  Realme 3 Pro Rumors  Anyway, the Realme 3 Pro is launching very soon in India. The company is targeting India as its primary market, where the Redmi Note 7 Pro reigns supreme. But for now, the specs of this phone are still in its rumors stages. For a phone that’s  launching on April 22 , these rumors might very well be the real thing. But hey, since there is no official word about this, let’s call them rumors.  So, according to rumors, the phone features a  6.3″ Full HD+ display , just like its predecessor. It probably will come with the same water-drop notch too. It will also pack  dual cameras . And one will be 48 MP – to take on the Redmi Note 7 Pro’s camera. No word on the selfie camera, though…except that it will be somewhere between 12 MP and 25 MP. We’re probably looking at a 16 MP unit.        Underneath, it will be powered by the  Snapdragon 710  as compared to SD 675 of the Note 7 Pro. Also, it will have  6 GB of RAM  and  128 GB  of storage. Of course, they won’t miss out on a microSD card. It has already been listed on Geekbench, and it scores 1483 on Single-core tests and 5900 on Multi-core.  In addition, this phone will pack a  3960 mAh battery  and run on  ColorOS 6  based on Android Pie. No word about any kind of Fast Charging technology, but there will be  Bluetooth 5.0  and a 5 GHz WiFi.  So, that’s all about the Realme 3 Pro rumors. No official word on pricing just yet. We can only guess. But since it’s launching in India, we might see it launch very soon in Nepal as well. So, what do you think about this? Will this be exciting enough?

['Samsung Galaxy A20 Launched in Nepal – Better than the Redmi Note 7?'],['Samsung'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['April 15, 2019']",2019-04-15 06:59:20+00:00,"['After it’s  “e” version  hit the international market, the Samsung Galaxy A20 has finally arrived in Nepal. The device offers a slight improvement over the  Galaxy M20 , more noticeably the AMOLED display. This alone might justify its steeper price tag, but then again, the A20 offers a low res display. There are a few other things to keep in mind as well, which we will get into. But for the price of Rs 19,490, the smartphone goes head to head with the  Redmi Note 7  or the  Vivo Y91i , one of which poses a serious competition.  Samsung Galaxy A20 Overview  Samsung Galaxy A20 sports a 6.4-inch 720P AMOLED display. It is powered by the Octa-Core Exynos 7884 chipset which is better than the Exynos 7904 found on the Galaxy M20. On the back, you get dual rear cameras like seen on the M20. There’s 4000mAh battery with 15W fast charging done via a USB-Type C port.  The Galaxy A20 sports an 8MP selfie camera. It is running on Android 9.0 Pie with One UI layered on top. There’s Dual SIM slot, 3.5mm headphone jack, and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. On the memory front, you get 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.        Should you buy the Galaxy A20? Is it a better option over the M20 or the Redmi Note 7? Well, it’s not really a simple question to answer, and it all depends upon you. If you want performance, Redmi Note 7 is the way to go, but if you want the best display, even with a low res 720P panel, the A20 takes this one. It also enjoys an upper hand when it comes to the software, so what about the cameras?   As for the Redmi Note 7, it’s definitely the strongest competitor to the Galaxy A20. This isn’t a bad thing, you won’t regret buying either of these phones. But what’s better is that competition is back, Samsung is trying to enter a market where Xiaomi has enjoyed dominance for the past few years.

This is the first time Daraz has introduced any sort of deals on the automobile front. The deal is already live and users can grab this offer while purchasing two-wheelers from TVS and NIU.  Daraz Offer on NIU’s two-wheelers  For those of you who are unaware, NIU is one of the manufacturers of electric two-wheeled vehicles. Their electric scooters are quite popular. And because of their research and innovation on the electric vehicles, they have also garnered a fair number of awards and accolades. It’s been a few years since NIU stepped its foot on Nepal.

So the initiation of the Daraz on bringing a better deal for the online users looks quite commendable.

We have all A-something phones except for an A60 and an A90. And while that is already an overwhelming number of phones, we also have a  Samsung  Galaxy A20e . What drove Samsung to make a smaller version of an already affordable mid-range phone? We don’t know. But it’s here.  The Samsung Galaxy A20e is a slightly toned down variant of the  Galaxy A20 . The A20e is smaller in size, meaning, it has a smaller display, but the same resolution. And that it has a smaller battery because of its small size. But other than that, there are no differences. Which leads to the same question: Why did they make it?         Samsung Galaxy A20e packs a  5.8″ IPS LCD display , but with HD+ resolution, and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9, just like the bigger model. Also, the dual rear camera setup at the back comprises of the same  13 MP primary lens  and a  5 MP ultra-wide angle lens . Also, its selfie camera is the  same 8 MP .  More similarities include the use of the same chipset, the  Exynos 7884 . It also sees the same amount of RAM, i.e.  3 GB . In addition, even the storage is the same at  32 GB ! Both make use of a micro USB port. The only other noticeable difference is the size of the battery which is  3000 mAh , due to its small size. But it still features the  15W Fast Charging .  Samsung Galaxy A20e Specifications:   Display : 5.8-inch\xa0 HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity-V display, (1560 × 720 pixels)  Rear Camera : 13 MP rear camera with LED flash, f/1.9 aperture, 5 MP secondary camera with f/2.2 aperture  Front Camera : 8 MP\xa0 with f/2.0 aperture  Processor : Octa-Core Exynos 7884  RAM : 3 GB RAM  Storage : 32 GB, expandable up to 256 GB via micro SD card  OS : Android 9.0 (Pie) with Samsung One UI  Sensors : Rear-mounted Fingerprint sensor  Connectivity : Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 5, GPS + GLONASS  Battery : 4,000mAh battery with 15-Watt Fast Charging   So, that was the Galaxy A20e. A smaller variant of phones makes sense for flagships. Just like the  Galaxy S10e  made of the  Galaxy S10 . There are quite a few differences. This, to me, does not make sense at all! Why did they make it? I just hope, they don’t make another one like this too soon. It’s going to get pretty confusing.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-a20e.jpg']

Yes, you read that right… The  Central Investigation Bureau  directed the  Nepal Telecommunications Authority  to impose a ban on the game. And that has come into action.  This widely  popular mobile game  recently came under siege due to some events and accidents. The world saw some quite bizarre actions from the players. More so, in India. And it seems that has followed its way to Nepal as well. Concerned guardians of some players sought the police for help after seeing their children developing disorders due to the game. They claimed that apart from not being able to concentrate on anything else other than the game, the children also faced sleeping disorders like  shouting  “maar maar”\xa0 while sleeping!  The game can be, honestly, quite addicting. And many who got addicted became victims of unfortunate circumstances. If you google “ Most bizarre PUBG related accidents , you’ll find some really unpleasant stuff. Some have gone through divorces, while some have left their family. As for others, less severe cases, they’ve become so addicted to the game – staying late in the night, and sometimes, until wee hours of the morning playing the game, and neglecting studies or jobs.         The game is now  banned in China  and sees a partial ban in India. It is  not playable for more than 6 hours in India , and police there have arrested quite a few youths for playing the game. And there were instances like a youth losing consciousness after continuously playing the game as well. And after a case lodged at the Kathmandu District Court, the game is now banned in Nepal as well.  Right now,  NTA has currently directed all the ISPs to ban the game on their networks . The ban, once live, will not let you download or play the game. While this can be revised in the days to come, is this really the solution?  Many argue that the game destroys mental health, and introduces addiction never before known. I, however, do not believe this. And many of you might share the same perspective.\xa0While there are arguments on whether video game addiction is even real, a certain study found this to be a real problem among very few people. But then again, most people who are into gaming don’t exhibit such behavior.  Here’s an  interesting take  regarding the ban of the game.  Gaming addiction, are most likely, a result of some other underlying mental or social problems – as a   Dutch study suggested . And a ban is not really a solution to these problems. There are things like VPN, and even if they ban the servers, there are plenty of other video games.  PuBG is addictive, yes. I, too, have found myself, playing the game continuously. However, one should learn to keep oneself in check. To get addicted to a point where you can no longer socially function, is not a fault of the game, but maybe the player? Of course,  it’s not his / her “fault” … but there must be an underlying cause. So, instead of banning the game so that a whole lot of healthy players suffer, maybe monitoring your child’s health or keeping yourself in check could be the solution?  What are your thoughts on this? We get that this could be a sensitive topic for some, and controversial for others. But do let us know your thoughts on this.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pubg-mobile.jpg']

Because, this lineup has the Galaxy A10, A20,  A30 , A40,  A50 , A70, and Samsung Galaxy A80. The only ones missing are the A60 and the A90, which, may or may not come out. But that’s a lot of phones!  The Galaxy A80 is the latest addition to the A-series. And this phone takes the Infinity Display to a whole new level! Well, not technically. It is a pop-up camera after all. But the pop-up camera is also slightly modified to use it as the selfie camera as well. So, basically, you have a  rotating camera module .  The Samsung Galaxy A80 features a  triple camera setup . That, however, is not new. But what’s new here, is when you trigger the selfie camera, the rear camera module slides up, and the sensors rotate frontward. That’s a  double sliding mechanism  in action.         Its triple camera setup comprises of a  48 MP primary camera  with f/2.0 aperture, and an  8 MP ultrawide sensor . However, contrary to our expectations, the  3rd lens is a 3D TOF (Time of Flight Sensor)  for better portrait shots and Augmented Reality applications. While augmented reality application is not fully fledged yet, it can help take portrait videos as well. Speaking of videos, this phone can do some fancy stuff like take 4K videos as well.  Apart from the camera, the phone packs a massive  6.7″ display  with Full HD+ resolution. The body is a glass construction with an aluminum frame in between. That is the making of most premium looking handsets. Under the glass, it runs on the new  Snapdragon 730 chipset   based on  8 nm fabrication process . Combined with  8 GB RAM , that should mean plenty of power at your hands! There’s also 128 GB storage on-board, a decent  3700 mAh  battery, and  25-Watt Fast Charging . For now, the fast charging here is better than what we get in the flagships,  Galaxy S10 and Galaxy 10+ .  Samsung Galaxy A80 Specifications:   Design : Glass body front and back, Aluminum frame  Display : 6.7″ Super AMOLED display with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2400 pixels)  Rear Camera : Triple, 48 MP primary lens with f/2.0 aperture & PDAF + 8 MP Ultra-wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture + 3D TOF sensor  Front Camera : Rotating rear camera (48 MP primary lens with f/2.0 aperture & PDAF + 8 MP Ultra-wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture + 3D TOF sensor)  Processor : Octa-core 8 nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 730  GPU : Adreno 618  RAM : 8 GB  Storage : 128 GB on board, non-expandable  Battery : 3700 mAh, 25-W Fast Charging  Sensors : Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Price : €649 ($730)   The Samsung Galaxy A80 is priced very close to the semi-flagship,  Samsung Galaxy S10e . It’s up to you to decide which one’s a better value for money. But what is more concerning than that, is having two motorized parts – which is not really convincing on the durability front.

And at the same time, we have the new  Oppo F11 Pro  that puts a focus on its camera prowess as well. Also, what could be a better way to advertise that than let a professional photographer shoot stunning pictures with the Oppo F11 Pro?   Oppo did just that. In the first-ever such collaboration, they got together with mountaineer  Dr. Nima Namgyal Sherpa , and professional photographer,  Adam Neng . They trekked the Everest Base Camp to capture some of the majestic landscapes that the heavenly place has to offer. And brought some pictures back for us to see.

The 48 MP camera, however, is most likely a  Samsung’s Bright GM1 sensor  as the camera has a  Quad-Bayer filter , meaning it uses  pixel binning  to take 12 MP resolution pictures, but that makes for less noise and more details, too. However, when every other smartphone company is going for a triple camera setup, this one still caps out at two. Of course, we would have loved to see a dedicated Ultra-wide angle sensor, but it misses out on that.  The  AI scene recognition  is there, which may have been responsible for such majestic photos. Oppo’s Ultra Night Mode also makes its way here, which gives us more balanced pictures at night time.

You just brought yourselves a problem that isn’t even supposed to happen.  But Samsung has added an option to remap its extra button, the infamous Bixby button, which is a nice thing. I use it to open the camera app, but it’s up to you to choose for yourself.  Continuing with the design, the Galaxy S10 is curved on the back, giving us a better feel on hands. However, due to the glass back, it is a lot slippery, so you should probably use a case at all times. I also like the color options these phones have. I am not into white phones, but this here, I liked. It has a white color that shows off subtle change in color according to its reflection. It’s really cool. But my pick of the bunch is the blue one, 100%. However, having used the Galaxy Note 9 for several months, the Samsung Galaxy S10 doesn’t feel as premium as its predecessor. Don’t get me wrong, it is premium, but it isn’t up there at the top. It actually feels more like the back on Samsung’s A-series smartphones.  We are all aware that both the S10 and the S10+ are more or less the same device. S10+ has the bigger display, bigger battery, and that twin notches with dual camera. The S10 is for those who want smaller form factor and minimalism.  Display   What Samsung has nailed is the display quality. When I used the  Note 9  for a while, I never thought Samsung could actually better it. And to my surprise, the Dynamic AMOLED panel is just great, the colors, the vibrancy, the sharpness, everything is just too good. And the screen bleeding over the edge makes this the best-designed phone for me. But the same infinity display brings in accidental touches. Even with the Accidental Touch Protection setting enabled, you will register a few unwanted touches, especially with one hand usage.  The Galaxy S10 has a 6.1-inch screen while the Plus model comes with a 6.4-inch screen. And me, personally, I like the larger displays as you get to see a lot of content on it. But most of the people I know have leaned towards the Galaxy S10 due to its “compact” design as it fits comfortably on the hand.  Also, the Blue light filter here is improved. What Samsung did is shift the “eye straining” blue light of the 450mm wavelength to a safer 465mm wavelength, which means my eyes are less stressed and I am less fatigued.  Performance  Talking about the processor, the units we reviewed are powered by the Exynos 9820. It excels all the benchmark tests and as far as the performance is concerned, initially I faced this PubG issue on the phone. See at first when I started playing the game, I had no problem at all. But reading all the posts about it lagging, I reinstalled it and that brought in the lags. And those lags were crazy, I start walking from somewhere and a few seconds later, I end up in the same place. This was obviously fixable through software updates, and Samsung has looked into it yet. I recently received an update on the phone which seems to have fixed the issue completely. Other than that, I have had no problem with the S10 as far as the performance is concerned. It easily handles all other games, and its RAM helps with the multi-tasking effectively. There have been no stutters anywhere, and you will get the almost perfect flagship experience with the phone.  Other than these two issues, I have had no problem with the Galaxy S10 as far as the performance is concerned. It easily handles all other games, and its RAM helps with the multi-tasking effectively. There have been no stutters anywhere, and you will get the almost perfect flagship experience with the phone.  Samsung Galaxy S10 Benchmark Tests   Geekbench v4.3.2   Single-core: 4460  Multi-core: 10046    AnTuTu v7:   329680    3D Mark   Slingshot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1: 4340  Slingshot Extreme Vulkan: 4297    PC Mark   Work 2.0: 7861    Andro Bench   Sequential Read: 794.35 MB/s  Sequential Write: 191.02 MB/s     Software  And part of this is also due to One UI, Samsung’s new and improved user interface. The software is really light, and even with a lot of customizations in its bag, it is really smooth. Gone are the days of laggy Samsung phones. Samsung has also made this UI by keeping tall phones in mind. If you have small hands, you will really like how the whole interface tries to bring most of the things down for the ease of use. However, I think that this UI’s icons are quite cartoonish and also the notification shade is too big for my taste.    Like always, though, Samsung has added in a few of its own applications with some being useful. The Samsung Password app saves you the hassle of saving your password every time, and Samsung health is helpful in keeping track of your health status. The heart rate sensor at the back, which is something essential and something we don’t get on any other smartphone. I have also seen people complaining about bloatware’s on Samsung phones, but there are very few that cannot be uninstalled. This includes the LinkedIn, Office mobile, galaxy store, and one drive. On the positive side, you get 100GB of cloud storage with Onedrive, which is a great complement to the internal memory.  Oh, I completely forgot about Bixby. Actually, Bixby was the first thing I disabled and I even remapped the button to the camera app. So, let’s not just talk about Bixby.    Camera   The cameras on the Samsung top of the line phones always have one of the best, it still not the best out there. The S10 is simply not as good as the  Google Pixel 3 . But maybe it lies somewhere in the top 4 list.  If you go by the specs, there’s the same primary lens as the S9 and Note 9, the same 2X telephoto lens, but we’ve got a new ultra-wide lens. So, you really get a complete package in the optics department.  When I got my hands on the Galaxy S10 a few weeks ago, I really wanted to see what Samsung had in mind with the camera. So, I went to a few places just to test out the triple cameras on the back. If you go by the specs, the phone has a primary lens, a wide-angle camera, and a telephoto lens. So, apart from the depth sensor, you really get a complete package in the optics department.  Until the Huawei P30 came out a few days ago, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ was the joint top on DxOMark’s camera rating, and after using the cameras in real life, well I think they are one of the best around. And here are the pictures to prove them.        1  of 2               Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Details 1         Huawei Mate 20 Pro Details 1                  There are ample details on the pictures, and even if you zoom into the image, you will still see a lot.        1  of 2               Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Dynamic Range 1         Huawei Mate 20 Pro Dynamic Range 1                  The dynamic range is great as well. The shadow details are well pronounced on the image, and there are no over-exposed highlight details. And all of these pictures have a natural color tone with a good level of saturation that looks natural to the eyes.        1  of 2               Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Wide-angle         Huawei Mate 20 Pro wide-angle                  Due to the telephoto lens, even when you zoom into the shots, you will notice no loss in terms of the quality, and this is really helpful. The wide-angle lens is of good quality as well. When I compared it against the Mate 20 Pro, the pictures from the Galaxy S10 had better colors and details. Take a look at the sky on these two images, the Galaxy S10 definitely has the better quality.        1  of 2               Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Portrait         Huawei Mate 20 Pro Portrait                  The Galaxy S10 doesn’t have a dedicated depth sensor, and even without it, the software does a good job in blurring out the background of the subjects effectively. Take a look at this shot, the colors are natural, and the background has been blurred out well.        1  of 1                            But there were times, where the subjects went a little soft like this statue here.        1  of 1                            Like the other flagship devices, Samsung has added in its own effects for its Live focus mode, I really like the Color Point mode that only applies colors to the subject. There is also the zoom and spin effect which is fun to play around with.  One thing Samsung should add to its camera app is a dedicated night mode. Now the night mode on phones may not be 100% great, but they are slowly getting there, and with software updates, they can really improve. So, Samsung should definitely keep this in mind and release a night mode for the S10 series.        1  of 2               Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Night details         Huawei Mate 20 Pro Night details                  As per the night shots, well, Samsung’s flagship devices have been doing well and the Samsung Galaxy S10 is no slouch. All the shots are well detailed and natural to the taste. The Mate 20 Pro did overexpose dark shots, but the Galaxy S10 remained all natural. Even the colors are reproduced well, and just like day time, the color tone is natural too. I know I have been saying natural far too often, but the cameras have really done well.        1  of 2               Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Normal Selfie         Huawei Mate 20 Pro Normal Selfie                  In the previous years, I had bashed Samsung for not including a good selfie camera on its flagship phone. But that has changed over the years, and this time, the company has included a good selfie shooter. In ample lighting, the selfies are well detailed and have an abundance of colors to them. They are of great quality.        1  of 2               Indoor Selfie         Indoor Selfie Portrait                  But if you are indoors under artificial lighting, the skin tone is quite weird, and the quality is not up there.   As for the selfie portraits, the Galaxy S10+ is the pick of the bunch with its depth-sensing camera. But I think it would have been better if Samsung had included the wide-angle selfie camera like Pixel’s in place of the depth sensing lens. The Galaxy S10 has this option to widen selfies, but that’s just dropping in and out of the same shot. This feature has resulted in an issue, though. When you video call someone from the Galaxy S10, the selfie video is zoomed into, and I don’t like this thing at all. Samsung if you’re reading this, please check into it.        1  of 2               Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Portrait Selfie         Huawei Mate 20 Pro Portrait Selfie                  Talking about the video, both the front and back of the S10 now can capture 4K video and the quality and the overall stabilization is just great. If you want to start vlogging, the S10 is a good way to get started. Also, there’s this super steady mode that’s really impressive as well.  Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner   Up front, the Samsung Galaxy S10 comes with an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. Now if you get the angle right, you can even see the sensor under bright sunlight. But this sensor is completely different from Huawei’s or OnePlus’ optic sensor as it takes a 3D map of the fingerprint by projecting out sound waves. Pretty cool right?  It’s fast and will also work when you have wet fingers. But I would say a couple of the phones with optic sensors can match the speed. And, it’s not accurate like all the other in-display sensors. It gets the readings right most of the time, but still, there are a lot of times throughout the day it doesn’t get them right. But this is the first generation of the technology, and I can wait to see its development.  What I found weird was when you get the angle right, you can even see the sensor under bright sunlight. \xa0I freaked out that day because I thought I had a faulty unit, but it is how it is.  Extras   Also, cool on the Samsung Galaxy S10 are the dual speakers. It’s the best I have seen on a phone and actually, I don’t need to carry a portable Bluetooth speaker. The Samsung Galaxy S10 is IP68 rated like most of the flagship devices so you can use it underwater too.  Like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the Galaxy S10 also has power sharing feature, so you can definitely charge up other wirelessly enabled products through the phone. And it’s a bit faster than Huawei’s take. It will especially come in handy while charging accessories. You won’t be able to charge up another device if the Galaxy S10 has less than 30% battery remaining, though.   The Samsung Galaxy S10 has ample memory with the storage going up to 1TB on the Galaxy S10+, although Nepali buyers will find 512 GB as the highest they can opt for. You also have a memory card slot along the dual SIM slots. And if the call quality is concerned, it is great, Samsung has actually included a tiny bezel for adding in the earpiece as well. So, yeah, you could take this as an advantage or the ugly point of its design!  Battery   Now, the battery is where the Galaxy S10+ has a big edge over the S10. \xa0While the S10 lasts for a typical day, the bigger battery of the S10+ will give you a little bit more. But that completely depends on your usage. To endure the battery life, I toned down the resolution of the display to 1080P, because, with QHD+ resolution, the battery life is really low, especially on the S10.  Also, like with the PubG issue, there were a lot of people complaining about battery life. Apparently, if you make VOIP calls like from messenger or WhatsApp, it won’t go into deep sleep and will remain active until you restart the whole device. So, the battery isn’t that efficient on this Exynos variant compared to the Snapdragon version. But again Samsung has solved this issue with the software update. Yaay!!  As for the charging time though, the Galaxy S10 takes about 2 hours to go from 0 to 100% which is slow for a flagship phone. It’s because Samsung is still using the 15Watt charging tech that was first used on the Galaxy S7.  Huawei has a 40Watt charger, OPPO has got a 50Watt charger and  Xiaomi is coming with the whooping 100Watt charger , and even S10’s 5G version has a 25Watt charger, so the 15 Watt charging speed on a flagship phone is something not very fancy.  Conclusion  So, the Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10+ are great devices for sure. But I feel like the updates that Samsung has brought are incremental and not worth upgrading if you’re already an S8, S9, Note 8 or Note 9 user. However, if you are using the S7 or its predecessors this is the right time for you to upgrade. Or even if you are coming from a midrange phone like I did, the S10 would be a great upgrade.  And talking about the S10 and S10+, since, S10 is cheaper among the two and does not miss out on essentials, I feel that it is the better deal of the two. But, again, it completely depends on your preference.  So, here’s my final conclusion: if you’re looking for a flagship phone right now, go for the S10 or S10+. You won’t regret it, I haven’t!      Pros  Cons    – Best Display on any smartphone  – Average battery life on Galaxy S10    – Great performance  – Power button’s placement    – Quality rear cameras  – Ultrasonic Fingerprint is quite inconsistent    – High standard speakers and ample storage']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-Plus-Review-1.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy Buds Review: Bitter Sweet Symphony'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Wearable']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 10, 2019']",2019-04-10 12:35:41+00:00,"['So, what do you do when your competitor excels in something you haven’t ever tried? Well, you definitely try to do the same thing, trying to better those competitors. And this device I have here with me is the example of that. This is the Samsung Galaxy Buds, and it is Samsung’s answer to the  Apple Airpods .  Airpods have been around for a while, and they are quite popular. I have seen a lot of people just roaming around rocking their Airpods. So, yeah, wireless buds are getting really popular and it was about time Samsung got into the act. So, I was really excited to use it, and thanks to Samsung’s offer, I got the Buds for free when I pre-ordered the  Galaxy S10 .  Design and Build         When I held the buds for the first time, I liked the heft it had. Even with the small design, its case is well-built and even if you drop them, they will handle that with ease. The case has a magnetic lid that snaps right on the base, and I really like the clickiness it has.  The buds are stored safely inside it and they are magnetically connected to the case giving you some protection. They are quite small and light, but again, just like the case it comes with, it is quality. Samsung has put a lot of effort into it, and the feel, the build quality, everything is great. It is a product from Samsung after all.  Along with the box, you also get differently sized wingtips and eartips in the package which really help with the usability. I got to choose the right fitting for my ear and that’s also one of the features that differentiates the Galaxy Buds and Apple Airpods. If you get the Airpods, you are fixed to one and only one size, but the story is different with the Galaxy buds. You can get comfortable just the way you like.  Sound Quality   Now let’s talk about the major purpose of any headset, the sound. Before I tried it with the Galaxy S10, I connected the buds to a non-Samsung smartphone. The sound was only average, though, and the bass was too weak. Thinking this was the case with phones other than the Samsung one, I ran it on the Galaxy S10. And the case was the same.  But with the Galaxy Wearable app, the buds do get a little better. Especially enabling the bass boost option, the overall sound quality does get better. There are also other sound options, but I always opt for the bass boost as it turns the below par bass to make it more amplified and better.  However, the bass of the Buds doesn’t define the pricing of the headset. The Sony earphone that I got for $30 definitely overpower the Galaxy Buds’ bass. If you really want the best of the bass, you can turn up the volume to the maximum, but I definitely suggest against it.   The sound, otherwise, is good. It has ample clarity, and the treble really pops. There is a treble boost option too if you want to get the best out of the high notes. And if you want balanced audio, go for the dynamic option.  However, the sound quality doesn’t define the price for me. It’s loud and all, but you will be missing that final punch, that one final punch that makes the audio sound the best. There is noise cancellation on the device which is one of its best parts, but like Becca Farsace of the Verge said, “There’s no mistaking that the sound is coming from a very small source and being shoved directly into your ears.” And that shoving is the major reason for the cancellation.  Call Quality  Although the people I called through the Galaxy buds haven’t really complained about the call quality, a lot of its users have had their share of issues. Apparently, in crowded places, the mic doesn’t receive users voice clearly. I haven’t faced that issue, though.  Control Center and Touch   For the smart side of Buds, Samsung has added touch sensitivity to its reflective side. The buds offer a few controls through touch. One tap plays or pauses audio, two taps play the next track or answer a call while three taps play the previous track. Samsung has offered a choice to remap the touch and hold button. I changed it to voice assistant, which here is the Google Assistant, not Bixby. A huge thumbs up for that!  But still, I would have liked to use the double tap for the voice assistant and swipe for changing volume. This would have been easier for users. I think Samsung can still change it with a software update.  Talking about software updates, I have already received a couple which is a great thing indeed. Another thing Samsung needs to better is the touch sensitivity. When I try to control the audio, the touches don’t register sometimes. And if I take off one of the buds, the audio doesn’t mute. These can be bettered with software updates, so I hope Samsung takes a look into it.  Ambient Sound  The other half-baked feature is the Ambient Sound mode. Samsung has included this feature so that the users can hear what’s happening outside their ears while rocking their Buds. The mic on the buds works like an actual mic to take in the sound and stream into the user’s ear. While this feature might sound good, it’s not. It doesn’t work if you’re listening to music, and when it does, it sounds like someone speaking from the worst quality mic.  Battery   What’s good is the wireless power sharing the S10 has. If you have the phone, you won’t have to worry about charging the buds every now and then, and even if you do, you won’t have to connect it to a cable as it can be wirelessly charged.  The buds offer a battery life of 5-6 hours and the case has an additional 7 hours of battery life. It takes about an hour and 30 minutes to charge up the whole thing with Samsung’s 15W fast charger.  Conclusion  Wireless is the future and the new Galaxy Buds prove that. They are smart and carry a huge potential in being one of the most sought out devices. Unlike Airpods, they can connect to any Android device and work tirelessly with the Galaxy Wearable app. It is sturdy, comfortable on the ear, and the sound quality is quite decent too. So, it must be the best right? Well, not really.  There are a few shortcomings on the device, and most of those shortcomings are what differentiates the headset from the best. Maybe this is because it’s Samsung’s first take on such technology, and maybe Samsung will come up with a better device next year. So, if you’re planning to get the Samsung Galaxy Buds, don’t. Wait for another year.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-Review.jpg']
"['Qualcomm announces Snapdragon 665, 730, and 730G chipsets for the midrange devices']",['Qualcomm'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 10, 2019']",2019-04-10 09:36:30+00:00,"['Lately, we haven’t seen from Qualcomm in the midrange segment. The midrange chips like Snapdragon 710, 675, and 670 offer more or less a similar performance. Snapdragon 712, the quick successor of the SD710 also didn’t bring much of an upgrade to the table. But this time around, Qualcomm came with a bang and launched three new midrange chipsets. Snapdragon 665 and Snapdragon 730 are targeted at mid-range and upper midrange devices. Alongside these two, Qualcomm brought Snapdragon 730G with the midrange gaming phones in mind.  Qualcomm Snapdragon 665  The major highlight of this new chipset is its CPU fabrication.  Snapdragon 660 , the predecessor of SD665 was based on 14nm fabrication. However, this new chip is based on  11nm fabrication technique , because of which it would consume less power and dissipate less heat than its predecessor on doing the same tasks. This is a huge step forward for a midrange chip. However, Qualcomm hasn’t changed the CPU architecture here. It uses the same octa-core setup with four big cores based on Cortex A73 and four small cores based on Cortex A53. Maybe it could be for the power efficiency purpose, Qualcomm has also decreased the clock speed of the four big cores. The big Kryo 260 cores here caps at 2.0GHz speed, which was 2.2GHz on the SD660.         On the GPU side, Qualcomm is claiming that the SD665 offer  20 percent better power efficiency  than the SD660. Although Qualcomm didn’t specifically mention the boost in the GPU performance, the generation jump of Adreno 512 to  Adreno 610  cues a significant change. In terms of ISP (Image Signal Processor), there is not a considerable enhancement. However, the Snapdragon 665 comes with the  3 rd  generation of Qualcomm AI engine , which offers up to  2x faster AI on-device processing capabilities  than the SD660. So with such a capable AI engine on the board, SD665 will show its proficiency on the scene and object recognition. Also, this new chip promises improvements in the places where Computer Vision like facial recognition is used.  Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 and Snapdragon 730G  It hasn’t been much Qualcomm announced Snapdragon 712 chip with a few enhancements over the SD710. However, there were not any sort of major upgrades, which everyone has expected and anticipated. But this time, Qualcomm released the true successor of SD710 in the form of Snapdragon 730. The chipset is based on  8nm fabrication technique , which is one of the major highlights of this new chip.   On the CPU side, there are two big cores and six small cores. But unlike the SD710, the big cores in the SD730 employs Cortex A76 cores. The power efficiency cores use the same Cortex A55 microarchitecture found on the SD710 but the small cores on the SD730 caps at 1.8GHz.   Talking about the GPU, the chipset comes in-built with Adreno 618 GPU, which promises 25% better over the Adreno 616 on the SD710. One of the prime reasons for this boost in performance is the increased number of ALUs in the SD730. Apart from that, the SD730 comes with 4 th  generation AI engine, because of which the newbie will have 2x faster AI processing capabilities over the SD710. Furthermore, the presence of latest generation Hexagon 688 DSP with Qualcomm’s new Tensor Accelerator units aids in better machine learning interfacing.   The new chip is also suited with top-notch imaging capabilities with the inclusion of Spectra 350 ISP. The chip also features CV (Computer Vision) acceleration. These are top-tier features and are expected at the flagship devices. And Qualcomm’s generosity here on providing such amazing features is definitely commendable.   Alongside the SD730, Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon 730G chipset. The ‘G’ suffix on the end cues for its gaming prowess. This variant comes with greater clock speeds than the normal variant. With extra tweaks and enhancements, this one offers 15% greater graphics performance than the standard SD730 version.

This time, with the S10 series, they outdid themselves, launching 4 variants of the S10 series. There is a regular  Galaxy S10 , it’s beefed up variant –  Galaxy S10+ , and the semi-flagship, the small  Galaxy S10e . Its 5G variant didn’t make it to Nepal for obvious reasons. And with this strategy, the S10 lineup seems to be doing quite well. And so, the company is doing the same for its Note 10 as well!  Even though there were two variants of the S-series flagships, the Note had only one. The trend was there until the  Galaxy Note 9 . But that’s all about to change. Latest rumors suggest that there are going to be 4 variants of the Note 10. Out of the 4, two will have 5G support while the other two will cap out at 4G. Of course, the 5G models will not show up to Nepal. Still, it’s interesting to know that Samsung is really trying to one-up its game.  What could be differentiating among these 4 models? There is not much information to go on. But so far, what we know is that there will be a  6.28″ model , a  6.4″ one  and a  6.7″ one . The smallest of them will follow the same strategy as the S10e, but of course, will have the S-Pen! A 6.28″ Note probably won’t look like a Note device, but since the S10e did a good job, we’re hopeful. The smaller variants of both the 4G and 5G models will have triple cameras at the back, whereas the larger ones will have quad-camera setups.        Of course, none of this is set in stone as of yet. These are rumors and can change at any time.

And in that run,  Honor Play  and  Honor View 20 (Honor V20 in China)  made commendable marks in the smartphone market. To continue the winning streaks, Honor is reportedly working on two new smartphones. According to the recent leaks, Honor is on the verge of expanding its lineup by bringing Honor 20 and Honor 20 Pro. And as the leak tips, these handsets will feature flag-grade specifications.  A week earlier, we heard about the Honor 20 and 20 Pro smartphones being approved by the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) body. That news divulged the existence of the Honor 20 series devices. But the recent leaks, which appeared on the Chinese website Weibo gave a clearer picture of the specs on the handset. Apart from the specs, the leak also brought the price and launch date of the device into the limelight.  When the devices were approved by EEC, the model number of the devices was listed as  YAL-L21  and  YAL-L41 . And these devices are expectedly making a debut in the market as  Honor 20  and  Honor 20 Pro  respectively.         Going by the specs, both of these devices are said to carry the  Kirin 980 chipset . This is the flagship chipset from Huawei, which appeared on the prime flagship devices like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, P30, and P30 Pro. On the memory side of things, the base variant will get  6GB RAM  and  128GB of onboard storage . Even on the software side, the phone will come with  Gaming+ ,  Link Turbo ,  CPU & GPU Turbo mode  to enhance the performance. With all these things aboard, the performance can be expected to be absolutely fluid here.  Lately, Huawei has been in a remarkable position when it comes to the cameras. And being the subsidiary brand of Huawei, Honor is also said to equip some capable hardware on the optics front. Honor 20 Pro is said to carry  a Sony IMX600 sensor , which was also used on the  Huawei P30 Pro . Whereas, the Honor 20 will rock with a  48MP main shooter . Apart from that, both the phones will supposedly carry a  20MP ultra-wide-angle camera  and an  8MP telephoto shooter . But unlike the P30 Pro, these smartphones are said to come with  3x lossless zooming . On the selfie part, a  32MP shooter  will do the job. The selfie shooter will dwell on the tiny notch on the top.  Both of these phones will carry the latest  Android Pie  with  EMUI 9.0  on the top. On the battery side, the phones are rumored to pack  3650mAh battery  with support for  22.5W fast charging . On the display side, the phone will get a  6.1-inch OLED panel .  The leak has also implicitly implied the price of the base variant. The modest variant of the Honor 20 series will supposedly carry a price tag of  CNY 2,999 (~$450) .

['Oppo revealed the camera specifications of its upcoming Oppo Reno smartphone'],['OPPO'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 7, 2019']",2019-04-07 10:16:02+00:00,"['When Oppo announced its Reno sub-brand and teased the Oppo Reno smartphone with a new type of pop-up camera, everyone was awe-inspired. The handset created even more excitements among the tech enthusiasts when Oppo announced the launch date of the device. The device is slated to launch on 10 th  of April. Ahead of the launch, Oppo started taking pre-orders for the device. And to lure people into pre-ordering the handset, Oppo also divulged the major specs of the device on the optics front.  The smartphone will come with a triple camera setup at the back. The first and most important one of the bunch would be the telephoto camera. In  MWC 2019 event , Oppo showcased the periscope style lens with a capability to capture images with  10x lossless optical zooming . And that would be the major highlight in the upcoming Oppo Reno smartphone. We recently saw Huawei pushing its optical zooming capabilities up to 5x in the  Huawei P30 Pro . The feature got everyone flabbergasted. So it would be even interesting to see Oppo doing its part in that respect. Oppo is said to use a 13MP sensor for this lens.         The phone will embrace 48MP Sony IMX 586 sensor as the primary snapper. With a ton of pixels in the sensor, we can expect some sharp details of the subject in the images. Lastly, there will be an ultra-wide-angle lens, which will come aboard with an 8MP sensor. The ultra-wide-angle shooter in this device will reportedly encompass the 120-degree field of view into the images.  Apart from that, the pre-order listing has also revealed the memory variants of the device. As far as the listing goes, the phone will come in three memory configurations: 6GB/128GB, 6GB/256GB, and 8GB/256GB. Even on the processor side, Oppo has made segregation. One of the devices will come with flagship Snapdragon 855 chipset, whereas the inexpensive one will flaunt Snapdragon 710. The listing also cues three color variants of the device: Black, Blue, and Green.  Oppo has still kept some of the specs under the veil to announce it in a full-fledged way in the launch event. However, Oppo revealed that the phone would come with an AMOLED panel with the 93.1-percent screen-to-body ratio on the display front. The phone will also get Android Pie out of the box. And needless say, there will be Oppo’s ColorOS 6.0 on the top.  The selfie expert is yet to flash the nitty-gritty details of the phone. However, the company boldly assured that the Oppo Reno 10X Zoom Edition smartphone will get the dual-frequency GPS.

['JBL Charge 4 Review: Portable Speaker with plenty of power at its sleeves!'],"['JBL', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['April 7, 2019']",2019-04-07 07:17:57+00:00,"['When it comes to  portable speakers , there are highly portable speakers like the  JBL Clip 3 , and ones like these as well – Charge 4. JBL’s Charge lineup is the one that has a built-in power-bank inside it. And that does come in handy sometimes. But what else does this speaker pack besides that? Let’s find out in this JBL Charge 4 Review.  JBL Charge 4 Specifications:   Connectivity Technology : Wireless (Bluetooth 4.2), Wired (3.5mm audio jack)  Controls : Activate Bluetooth, power on/off, volume  Battery : Rechargeable  Recharge Time : 5.5 hours  Battery Backup (Up To) : 20 hours  Protection : Waterproof (IPX7 certified)  Speaker Channel Type : Mono  Amplification Type : Active  Transmission Range : 9 meters  Intelligent Assistant Compatible : Google Assistant, Siri  Hands-Free Function : Yes  Amplification Type : Active  Audio Amplifier : Integrated  Dimensions : 22 x 9.5 x 9.3 cm  Weight : 960 grams  Color Options : Desert Sand, Mustard Yellow, Dusty Pink, Grey Stone, River Teal, Fiesta Red, Ocean Blue, Midnight Black, Steel White, and Forest Green  Price : Rs. 19,500    Buy JBL Charge 4 here  Design  As it is with most of JBL speakers, the design and form factor tend not to change all that much. It is the same as the JBL Charge 3. But this one is slightly bigger than its predecessor. And so, its slightly heavier as well. At some 950 grams, portability takes a major hit! Well, it is portable, just not something you’d want to carry around all day long.         As for the looks, it is kind of cylindrical with side-firing passive radiators. The whole of the speaker is wrapped in a cloth and metallic grille. But it seems it’s easily scratch-able. It rests on a raised rubber-pad surface to avoid rolling around. There’s also a flap with the “Charge 4” written on it, that houses a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-C port for charging it, and a USB-A port for you to charge your phone with.   The top houses the control panel with the Power button, Bluetooth button, Volume buttons, Play / Pause button, and a JBL Connect+ button. The play/pause button can also skip a track when pressed twice on your phone. And the JBL Connect+ can allow you to link other JBL wireless speakers to play the same audio.  This speaker is also IPX7 rated for water and dust resistance. You can submerge it up to 1 meter for about 30 minutes, so, perfect for pool parties and such and even rain-festivals.  Sound Quality  Hmmm…about the sound quality, I am not really sure what to make of it. I mean the sound quality is good enough, but there is just too much bass. The first thing you’ll notice is how loud the speaker can get. It’s really really loud even for something with a mono audio output.  That’s right. Even there is space enough for dual drivers, there’s only one that outputs 30 Watts of audio. However, you can’t really tell the difference until you get really close to it.   I wouldn’t advise listening to songs on the highest of volumes because that can really set you off. It’s loud as it is, even in normal volumes. But that kind of makes it perfect for house parties too, so, depends on your needs as well.  As I already said, this thing packs a lot of bass. So, if you want something with bass, then, this one could be the right choice. The bass in this one actually subdues other aspects of the audio, so, I couldn’t really get the exact highs and lows on tracks.  It can handle instrumentals really well, but the problem lies in the vocals. The passive bass radiators add to the already high bass, or maybe they make the bass high, but the end result is it subdues the vocals, so, understanding lyrics of some of your songs could be a bit difficult. So, it’s not really for those lyrical ones. It’s mostly suited for instrumentals.   Now, for me, I test all speakers with “Bohemian Rhapsody”. It kind of happens to be my favorite song as well. And in that song, the speaker does great on the instrumental part. The audio is clear and it is also on the brighter side, but as soon as the Freddie starts singing, his vocals seem to get drowned by the drum sounds.  This thing has also got the head-room, i.e. the ratio of distortion to the volume is also pretty balanced. That is, even at high volumes, there is no distortion, but then again, you can’t listen to it at high volumes.  So, this speaker can almost handle all kinds of music including metal – it’s just that the bass is overpowered, and that can put many people off.  Connectivity and Battery  The JBL Charge 4 comes with Bluetooth 4.2, so, you get the standard 30 feet connection. But as usual, connecting it is very easy. Just pair it once, and then, it connects to your device automatically.  As for the latency, you will notice a very slight amount of it. It will not even be noticeable while watching music videos, but watching movies can show you slightest delays of like 0.3 seconds or so. And that, I guess, is normal.  There’s also the JBL Connect+, which I already mentioned. You can connect quite a few JBL speakers compatible with this feature, so, for larger parties, this can work as well.   As for the battery, this speaker packs a giant 7800 mAh battery, which claims about 20 hours of battery life. Now, that is the same amount of battery life as the Charge 3. And you can’t quite get full 20 hours, but only up to like 17 hours on medium volumes and something like 13 on high. Of course, that can mean like 4-5 days of battery for a normal user. And it takes like 4 hours to fully charge. There’s also LED indicators to show you the battery levels, which is good.   And yes, the charge 4 can charge your other phones or earphones as well, and the charging speed seems okay too. Charging my  Galaxy S10e  on it and the regular way showed me, more or less, similar charging times.  Conclusion  Okay, now I feel like that the JBL Charge 4 is a good speaker, but I think the price is asking a bit too much. A $150 price tag or about Rs.19500 in Nepal is enough for me to put it aside. Honestly, I would never invest that much money on a portable speaker. I’d rather buy those larger home speakers or woofers for this kind of money.  But hey, that’s just me. Because if you have got the money, and want a portable speaker for pool parties or house get-togethers, then, this can be a great option. And this one particularly feels like it’s meant to be used at parties, and not like, when you’re alone or something. Because this one is pretty loud to be used in your own room.   Plus, the battery seems to last like forever. I didn’t have to charge it for like a week in my usage terms.  The only problem lies with the price here. For me, it just doesn’t provide that value for money we all look for. Plus, you do get a lot of deals on last gen Charge 3 which is more similar to this one.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jbl-charge-4-review.jpg']

There is also a  dedicated SD card slot  for the people, who plan to extend the storable memory on the phone.  On the optics front, the phone enjoys  12MP + 2MP setup  at the back. And with two rear cameras at its helm, this budget device can also capture the portrait images. There is an  8MP front camera  dedicated for the selfies. When it comes to the software, the phone boots on latest Android Pie out of the box. As far as the battery is concerned, a sizable  4000mAh battery  promises a prolonged endurance.

Both of them get the Glass material on the front and on the back. And to ensure the safety of the front and the rear panel, a tough  Gorilla Glass 5  has also been provided on the top.  In terms of display, the Note 7 is equipped with a  6.3-inch IPS panel . And the screen here is enriched with  Full-HD+ resolution . So, at a  pixel density of 409PPI , the contents on the screen look sufficiently sharp. The display on the device also has a tiny water-drop style cutout on the top. Since the cutout is very small, it doesn’t bother much while viewing the contents.   Performance has always been a strong suit of Redmi devices. And it’s no exception here. The handset flaunts a capable  Snapdragon 660 chipset . And paired that with  3GB/4GB of RAM , even the high-end games like  PUBG and Asphalt 9 are playable  at decent frame rates.  But the major highlight of the device is its camera. The phone boasts a  48MP Samsung’s ISO cell GM1 sensor . With such a high-res sensor on the board, the handset can pull in some extra amount of light and some extra amount of details in the images. So we can expect the images from the device to be bright and sharp. However, the handset is capable of capturing 12MP images (unless you go into the Pro mode). The phone does  4-in-1 pixel binning   to merge the pixel and to output a sharp photograph. When it comes to the front camera, a  13MP selfie snapper  comes into action on capturing selfies, unlocking the device via Face unlock feature and while video calling.  The phone is powered by  Android 9 Pie  and flavored by  MIUI 10  on the top. The battery on the device is  4000mAh , which also comes with the  18W fast charging support . Also, the charging port here is a  USB Type-C port  and the handset is the first Redmi device to come with this feature.

Although the small punch-hole cutout on the display is less obtrusive, Samsung doesn’t have plans to stick to that display design for a longer time. Samsung is planning to go all out to bring all-screen display (or “New Infinity Display” in their language) in the future. For that,  Samsung is working on the in-display selfie camera , which, however, may not come into commercial production for a year or two. So for the time being, Samsung plans to implement a sliding camera setup to get rid of the nuisance caused by notches, punch holes, and ugly bezels. And it’s coming into reality sooner than expected. A video recently appeared on the internet, which showed  Samsung Galaxy A90 (allegedly) featuring sliding and rotating cameras .  Source: WaqarKhanHD  Ice Universe (@UniverseIce), quite a renowned expert to know about the feature and design of the unreleased Samsung phones recently retweeted a post. The post contains the alleged Samsung Galaxy A90 2019’s video. And the tweet bore the caption “Almost completely correct”. The original video tweet was from Waqar Khan (@WaqarKhanHD), who posted the video with a special hashtag  #NotAprilFoolsJoke . Although we haven’t heard any sorts of leaks or unannounced products, the video looks promising. And it thoroughly matches with all the previous leaks and rumors about the Galaxy A90. Furthermore, the caption from the Ice Universe has also fueled the speculation.   Almost completely correct.  https://t.co/5E0lKnC97i  — Ice universe (@UniverseIce)  April 4, 2019         Samsung Galaxy A90 Video  The handset encompasses a slider mechanism on the back, which houses a  dual camera setup . The cameras are aligned in a horizontal configuration with an LED flash in between. When the slider goes up, this dual camera is rotatable. So when capturing the selfies, it can be rotated towards the front and normally can be switched to the back. Since the handset has  two movable parts (slider and rotatable cameras) , the durability of the device could a concern if the device comes into life.  Vivo V15 Pro  guarantees 300,000 pops. And if Samsung gives us similar numbers in the launch event, it will see many smiling faces.  In the video, when the slider was pulled down, the cameras were always facing backward. So it’s not clear if we can shut the slider with the cameras facing forward. If that’s possible, the camera could be protected from the dust and scratches.   The video was centered on portraying Samsung Galaxy A90’s sliding and rotatable cameras. There was no mention of other features of the device. Earlier rumors suggested that the phone will have three cameras at the back. A 48MP, f/2.0 main camera, 8MP, f/2.4 ultra-wide-angle camera, and a ToF lens. So was the Ice Universe’s caption implying the lack of the third lens? Well, we may have to wait for the launch of the device. And the device will be officially unveiled on the 10 th  of April.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-a90.jpg']

"['Everything you need to know about Wireless Charging: The past, present & the future']","['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 4, 2019']",2019-04-04 05:16:42+00:00,"['It won’t be a surprise when you see a tangled nest of wires in the corner of a table. Untangling your charging cable to charge your smartphone from such nested loops of the wires is frustrating at times. And to solve this very issue, smartphone manufacturers are striving to make their handsets compatible with the wireless charging.\xa0 But has it been effective on the run? How has this technology evolved over the years? And is wireless really the future? Let’s discuss on it.  The Past  Before I dive straight into the concept of wireless electricity, let me explain how the electricity actually evolved. It all began when Michael Faraday, also known as the father of electricity discovered the underlying principles of electromagnetic induction. He stated that in the presence of alternating or the changing magnetic field, an electromagnetic force is produced across an electric conductor. We generally understand the electromotive force as a voltage, which drives current in any circuit. Since the technology is still used to generate electric power even to this day, you can easily guess what a breakthrough discovery it was at that time. No doubt, it really changed the fate of science forever.         Although Faraday did experimental verification of this breakthrough discovery, he couldn’t quite establish the relationship between electricity and magnetism in terms of mathematical expression. But James C Maxwell, an apprentice of Faraday, later developed a mathematical relationship between electricity and magnetism. The scientist also discovered Light as an electromagnetic wave.  Thomas Alba Edition was also a big hero at that time. He discovered the incandescent light and also constructed the first ever electric powerhouse, which produced 30KW of DC power back then. But at the same time as the Edition, there was another ingenious scientist named Nicholas Tesla, who invented AC or the alternating current and saw quite a lot of potential on it. And in the late 1800s, Tesla used the idea to demonstrate the concept of resonant inductive coupling by lighting an incandescent lamp wirelessly.  Wireless Bulbs  The invention was visionary and way ahead of its time. However, scientists used the concept just for the innovation and development of motors and transformers, which was still a big thing by the way. The major obstacle for the development of wireless technology back then was the  size constraints of the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design .  But in the 1990s and early 2000s, the technology advanced quite a bit and wireless technology slowly started to take shape. The early implementations were on the consumer electronics devices. You might’ve heard about the  Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes . Well, Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes are one of the first devices to charge under Wireless charging mechanism.  But it took a while for the technology to be implemented on smartphones. Back in the CES 2009, Palm Inc. announced its  Pre smartphone  with an optional inductive charger accessory, which carried the company’s proprietary name “Touchstone”. That’s surprising, right? When Apple’s iPhones and Samsung’s Galaxies take almost all the titles for innovations, the entry of a new smartphone brand with such a compelling feature was definitely awe-inspiring.   [You can watch from 47:45 onwards to know about its wireless charging feature]  But that’s not all. The inductive wireless charging technology on the device was also integrated with the software. So when a user gets an incoming call, his Palm Pre phone charging wirelessly, he can simply pick the phone up from the Touchstone to answer the call automatically. And pressing the answer button with the phone on the Touchstone used to answer the call in a hands-free mode. So, needless to mention, it was an awe-inspiring innovation. And even to this day, the smartphone is still remembered as the handset with the technology ahead of its time. But due to some pitfalls, the smartphone didn’t receive all the attention it deserved.  Since the wireless charging technology was starting to take pace, different charging standards were introduced. You might have heard about the PMA (Power Matter Alliance) and the Qi Standard. Each standard has its own set of operating systems. They also use different transmission frequencies and connection protocols. So a device compatible with one standard may not be compatible with the other standard.  In the case of PMA and Qi, the operating mechanism is vastly similar. Both of them are based on inductive charging mechanism in which electrical energy transfers from charging pad to the charging device using an electromagnetic field. However, the major difference lies in the wavelength used.  Qi works on a 100 – 205 kHz band  whereas the  PMA makes use of the 277 – 357 kHz band . That’s the reason why one standard doesn’t work with another.  With that little info, let’s continue with the evolution of wireless charging.  After Palm, Nokia joined the party. Nokia launched the Lumia 920\xa0and\xa0Lumia 820 smartphones in September 2012, which had integrated inductive charging and inductive charging feature with an accessory back respectively. Those smartphones were based on the Qi standard of wireless charging. It was quickly followed by Google. In October of 2012, Google, in collaboration with LG launched the Nexus 4, which was also based on the Qi standard. After that, a lot of companies followed the bandwagon and the Qi standard gained quite a momentum. Motorola, HTC, Samsung, and lately Apple also included wireless charging feature all based on the Qi standard. That’s one of the reasons why Qi standard is so popular these days.  But PMA standard was left far behind. Although some companies favored the PMA standard slightly by including the dual standard, the PMA standard couldn’t make any significant progress in the long run. Samsung and Blackberry had included  Dual standard of wireless charging  in their flagship devices in 2015. It means that the  Samsung Galaxy S6/S6 Edge  and the Blackberry Priv used to charge wireless both through the PMA and Qi chargers. But PMA these days is nowhere to be heard.  How does Wireless Charging work?  With this history, you might have gained insight into the evolution of the wireless charging. But how does a wireless charging takes place? You might be wondering about that too! Keep calm; I am going to answer that too.  In the wireless power transfer mechanism, again the Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction comes into play. And it inherently requires two conducting units: one the transmitting device and the other receiving device. The transmitting device features a power input port, a PCB board with an Oscillator circuit, and a Transmission Coil with the tightly wound copper element. When the transmitting device is connected to the power supply, it draws electric power from the power source and drives the transmitter coil. The transmitter coil operates at a high frequency and the oscillator circuit helps it to achieve that. So when the transmitter coil gets triggered, it creates high frequency alternating magnetic field.  Transmitting Mechanism  And when the receiving device is nearby, the magnetic flux produced by the transmitter coil is cut by the conductor of the receiver coil. This leads to the production of an electromotive force or the voltage in the receiver coil. And as I mentioned earlier, it happens all due to the Faraday’s law.  Receiving Mechanism  The voltage, however, will have a very high frequency and cannot be used directly to charge our phone or any other devices. Charging the battery in any electronic devices requires a direct current. So this high-frequency AC power is not useful for direct use. To make it useful, the receiving device is equipped with the circuitry to convert the AC quantity into DC and filter circuit to suppress the unwanted harmonics. This is the basic principle of the wireless charging also known the Inductive charging mechanism. There have also been quite researches and developments on the wireless charging through Infrared, Microwave, UltraSound, and laser beams. However, those concepts haven’t come into mainstream use as of now.  The Present  So where are we? Although there haven’t yet seen the major breakthrough yet, there surely have been some progress. In different countries, charging stations have been established to charge electric vehicles wirelessly. And in the smartphone technology,  Huawei   brought the reverse wireless charging feature through which receiving and sharing the power has been much easier and convenient. The feature also made debut in the recently launched  Samsung Galaxy S10 devices . So we might be able to see this feature in other devices too.  Advantages of Wireless Charging  Why so many companies are tussling to provide the wireless charging feature? You might be curious about that. With the wireless charging, the charging cables don’t wear out very fast, which is a prominent case in the wired charging. Also, it’s really easy and convenient to charge the device, just keeping the device on the charging pad starts to refill the battery. And since there is no cable or conductor directly involved, there are fewer chances of shocks and electrical hazards.  Disadvantages of Wireless Charging  But after everything you know, you might be wondering why the progress is happening at such a slow pace. And why other major tech companies haven’t shifted into the wireless ecosystem? Well, the major constraint has been the distance. The electronic devices only charge when they are placed right on the top of the charging pad. It also needs to be placed perfectly parallel on the charging pad. And this can be frustrating at times.  Since the device always has to be placed on or nearby the charging pad, it can barely be used while charging. This is one of the major cause of why the users mostly choose to charge their devices through wired means.   Another reason is efficiency. Wireless charging takes places at a very slow rate compared to the conventional wired charging. And since the ultrafast charging technology like Oppo’s Super VOOC and Huawei’s Super Charge technology is evolving, the slow charging speed in the wireless mechanism is not as enticing.  Also, the inefficient charging mechanism produces a considerate amount of heat, which also affects the battery life in the long run. Plus there is the compatibility issue. There is a fair number of charging standards like Qi, Rezence, and PMA. A device is usually compatible with only one charging standard. And since this kind of chargers hasn’t been mainstream like the Micro USB and USB Type-C chargers, people usually prefer using the wired means of charging when they are outside the home or when traveling.  Where are we heading?  Wireless charging looks very tantalizing. You don’t even have to connect your device to the wall charger and it starts juicing up. How cool is that? And the progress made through ultrasound, Infrared, and through laser technology has left the tech community awe-inspired.  However, in a study conducted by Wireless Power Consortium, the creator of Qi standard, they found that Qi standard has the efficiency of wireless charging to be 59.4% whereas their arch rival Rezence has an efficiency of 39.6%. And these statistics is absolutely repelling. It also begs a question. At the time, when the world is going through the energy crisis, is wireless charging really that essential?  Statistics have shown that there were over 4.5 billion people using the mobiles in 2018. And the number is only growing. Also, there are more devices to consider like electric vehicles and other consumer electronics devices. What would happen if all these devices start charging through the wireless means? Well, electricity generation has to be doubled for compensation.  So maybe, just maybe, should we have to wait for the right time to switch to the wireless ecosystem? When the power transfer process is efficient and the charging speed is fast? I guess it would be better if we see an ultrafast and efficient wired charging technology and more efficient batteries for the time being. What do you think?

['Oppo Announced Oppo A7n: A beefed-up variant of the Oppo A5s'],['OPPO'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 3, 2019']",2019-04-03 09:05:42+00:00,"['A few weeks back, Oppo launched its budget-friendly handset, the  Oppo A5s . And this time, the Chinese smartphone maker relaunched the device in the Chinese market with beefed-up RAM and storage. Dubbed as Oppo A7n, the new handset has also received an upgrade in terms of selfie camera.  Oppo A7n Overview:  The newly announced Oppo A7n also has similarity over the last year’s  Oppo A7 . It comes with a 6.2-inch IPS display with a tiny water drop notch on the top. Even the resolution is the same here. The A7n comes with HD+ display resolution in a 19:9 aspect ratio.  On the performance side, the phone gets the MediaTek Helio P35 chipset, which we already saw on the Oppo A5s. However, unlike A5s, the newbie features 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard memory. What’s completely new here is the presence of the Hyper Boost Acceleration engine, which promises to enhance the performance and the gaming experience.        Oppo smartphones are usually centered around the cameras. So let’s talk about the optics part of the phone now. The handset boasts a dual camera setup on the back. The camera duo on the back encompasses a 13MP, f/2.2 shooter backed by a 2MP, f/2.4 depth sensor. The camera setup looks similar to that on the A7 and A5s. So we can expect a similar performance from all these handsets.   On the front camera, however, the A7n differentiated itself from the A5s and joined the league with the A7. The selfie shooter here has employed a 16MP sensor, which comes with an f/2.0 lens. The phone also comes with the AI-backed beautification. The phone is said to identify 296 facial points to smartly beautify the faces in real time.  When it comes to the battery, the device is quite a powerhouse in itself. The device houses a whopping 4230mAh battery. The handset also comes with “App freezing” feature due to which the background apps do not draw any power and the battery life prolongs. However, the handset still comes with the Micro USB port, which is quite a bummer.  On the security side, the smartphone comes with a fingerprint scanner and the Face Unlock feature. To ensure an extra level of privacy, Oppo has also included a one-touch key on the device, which lets the user switch between private mode and public (regular) mode.  Software-wise, the phone boots on Android Oreo out of the box with ColorOS 5.2 on the top. The phone comes with Lake Light Green Color and is priced at ¥1499 (~$222). However, Oppo hasn’t spoken anything regarding its availability.

Yes, it does support Samsung’s 15W fast charging but it is slow compared to others. That might change sometime soon as the company is looking to update the S10 series’ fast charging support.  Don’t Miss:  Samsung Galaxy S10E is now available at the cheapest price possible  The Samsung Galaxy S10 is one of the most sought out devices right now. They have a lot to offer and come with quite a bit of features inside. Ranging from the display to the cameras, the series really has set a high standard for smartphones.        Speaking at an event, Samsung China’s President said that the company is thinking about upgrading the Galaxy S10 series’ fast charging power to 25W from the 15W it currently has. On our tests, the Galaxy S10 takes around an hour and 40 minutes while the Galaxy S10+ takes nearly 2 hours to fully charge.  With companies like Xiaomi, Huawei and OnePlus making huge strides with their proprietary fast charge technology, it was about time Samsung did something about theirs.  The Korean Giants are also reportedly considering adding Night Mode into the Galaxy S10 series’ camera application. With  Pixel 3  making strides with its Night Sight feature, and Huawei introducing its low-light champ – the  P30 Pro . The P30 Pro packs four cameras on the back which Huawei claims can “transform night into day”.  Night mode has really become popular since Google introduced the feature for the Pixel 3. It was really strange for Samsung to skip on this feature on its new flagship series. Since this is a software feature, the Korean company could easily add it on its flagships for an even better photography experience.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-update.jpg']

There are a few smartphones in this category that offer a lot at a time when the price of the flagship devices such as the  Samsung Galaxy S10  and the  Huawei P30 Pro  are skyrocketing. One of those lower flagship-priced smartphones, the  Oppo R17 Pro  just received a price drop  to make it more affordable than it previously was.  Oppo R17 Pro Overview  The Oppo R17 Pro sports a similar design to the  OnePlus 6T . It has a tall  6.4-inch AMOLED display  with  Gorilla Glass 6 protection . There is a water drop notch holding the front-facing camera measuring  25-megapixel .  The Oppo R17 Pro is powered by the  Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 chipset  coupled with  8 GB of RAM  and Adreno 616 GPU. Oppo has offered  128 GB of internal memory  which is expandable via a microSD card. The device runs on the older  Android 8.1 Oreo  with ColorOS on top. There is an  under display fingerprint scanner  on the R17 Pro.         As for the optical side of things, there are triple cameras on the back of the Oppo R17 Pro. There is a 12-megapixel primary camera, a 20-megapixel depth sensor, and a  ToF 3D stereo lens . A  3,700 mAh battery  backs the device with Oppo including its  Super VOOC fast charging  on the phone.  Oppo R17 Pro Pricing (After price drop)  When Oppo launched the R17 Pro in Nepal, we had complained about its exorbitant price tag. The phone, while not housing a flagship-grade processor, cost a whopping  Rs. 89,990 . With the price drop, the Oppo R17 Pro now sells for  Rs. 75,990  as a New Year Offer.  Even with the improved pricing, the phone, in my opinion, is still overpriced. The OnePlus 6T looks definitely a better deal, and the ongoing sale on the  Samsung Galaxy S10E at  Sastodeal is an absolute steal.

Since it comes with almost all the major features of the more expensive  Galaxy S10 and S10+ , the handset really offers a great value for the price it’s asking. And this amazing device is now available for purchase in Nepal at the least price possible. This offer is introduced by SastoDeal and is slated to last for a week. But since SastoDeal is offering a  discount of Rs. 20,000  and the  stocks are limited , the smartphone could run out of stock before the designated time period. So if you are interested in the deal, you better hurry up.  Since the e-commerce website is offering so much of discount, you might have doubts about the  genuineness of the product . But there is nothing to be suspicious about it. The  smartphone is from IMS , one of the authorized distributors of Samsung products in Nepal. When you purchase the device, you will receive a  sealed pack unit  and will also get  one year of warranty .  Samsung Galaxy S10e Overview:  Design  Despite being an affordable flagship from Samsung, the handset looks and feels very premium. Samsung has used glass back here and a sturdy aluminum frame to ensure robustness. Since the device also happens to  IP68 certified , the handset is  water and dust resistant  as well.        Display  On the display side, the handset flaunts a  5.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display . The screen on the device is surrounded by narrow bezels and has a tiny hole punch on the top to accommodate the selfie camera. With such setup, the display on the device is really immersive. As Samsung has used Dynamic AMOLED panel on this device, which also happens to be  HDR 10+ compliant , users can feel cinematic expensive while viewing the contents.   Camera  On the optics front, the Galaxy S10E is enriched by dual camera setup at the back. The  primary 12MP camera  is accompanied by a  16MP ultra-wide-angle shooter . So in addition to the portrait images, users can also expand the field of view of images while capturing the images from the device. Similarly, a  10MP selfie shooter  dwells on the tiny hole punch cutout. Apart from the normal and portrait selfies, the front snapper on this device also  records steady 4K videos . This feature is unavailable on most of the flagships available in the market right now. That’s why the Galaxy S10E is one of the desirable handsets of 2019.  Performance  On the performance side, the phone comes with  Exynos 9820 chipset   with  6GB of RAM . There is also  128GB of onboard memory . And in the case of need, users can expand it up to 512GB using an SD card. With such kind of hardware setup, the smartphone can load and run anything thrown at it.   Extras  The phone boots on the latest  Android Pie  out of the box with  Samsung’s One UI  on the top. The battery has to be the major compromise on the device since it comes with a mere  3100mAh capacity . But since there are too many other things to like about the phone, the battery may not matter much especially for the price.  At a time, when the smartphones are moving forward without the  3.5mm headphone jack . Samsung hasn’t taken that away from the audiophiles. Plus, there is a  stereo speaker setup . So, the audiophiles can enjoy the immersive sound here.

However, you will find a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor instead of a much expensive in-display sensor. There’s also a  water-drop notch upfront . Its display is a  6.15″ IPS LCD  with  Full-HD+ resolution . So, not so different from the other mid-range we’re seeing these days, is it?        Performance and Memory  Now, with a name like P30 Lite, it might appear as if it’s similar to the likes of  Galaxy S10e . But this one is strictly a mid-ranger. Packing the  Kirin 710 SoC  inside, there’s also  6 GB RAM  in it. Internal storage rests as  128 GB  but there’s a microSD card slot as well, so, no worries, there The chipset here is one that we saw in the Nova 3i and Honor 8X. The SoC can handle the everyday task that you throw at it. In our review, we played Asphalt 9 in the device and it runs without any major hiccups.   Camera  The camera on the P30 Lite isn’t the same that we found on the P30 and P30 Pro. It features a triple camera setup. The primary camera has a 24MP sensor and is accompanied by an 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera and a 2MP camera.\xa0 The output is the same as that in other mid-range devices. The photos are detailed, a little saturated but decent anyways. On the front, there is a 32MP selfie camera which gives colorful. and bright pictures.  Battery and Others  The P30 Lite  3340 mAh battery , which comes with support for  18W fast charger . On average, the battery should last a whole day. The 18W charger in the box can charge the device form 0 to 100% inside 2 hours. The port is provided is Type-C port. The speaker on the bottom of the device is loud enough and there’s a headphone jack too. The capacitative fingerprint sensor on the back is quick and accurate unless your hands are wet. There is also a Face Unlock feature but it isn’t the most accurate one since it uses the camera.  Check out the complete review of  Huawei P30 Lite  here.

For its price, the device goes head to head with some popular devices such as Realme 3. Let’s check out the complete specs, updated price, and availability of Huawei Y6 Pro in Nepal.  Huawei Y6 Pro Overview  Design and Display  The Huawei Y6 Pro follows all the latest trends you see on budget phones. It features a tall  6.1-inch HD+  display. There is a tiny dewdrop style notch on the top of the screen to house the front camera. Thanks to the faux leather finish, the device looks and feels premium on hand.\xa0There is nothing on the rear panel except for the camera bump. An LED flash resides just below the bump. The device doesn’t come with a fingerprint sensor         Talking about the camera, there’s a  13MP  lens on the back with a bright f/1.8 aperture. Almost all the new releases at this price range now come with at least a dual rear camera setup. On the front, the notch houses an  8MP selfie  snapper, a LED notification, and a selfie flash. An LED notification may not sound that important but it turns out really helpful in real-life scenarios.  The Huawei Y6 Pro is powered by a  MediaTek Helio A22  chipset. It’s an entry-level chipset with four 2.0Ghz Cortex A53 CPU cores and a PowerVR GE8320 GPU. The memory is also decent for the price with  3GB of RAM  and  32GB of storage . There’s a  dedicated microSD  card slot for storage expansion up to 512GB. Huawei could have done better in the performance aspect since  Galaxy M10 ,  Realme 3  and  Oppo A5s  are offering a more powerful octa-core CPU.  There’s a  3020mAh battery  with should be ample, considering it only has to power HD+ display, and the chipset is based on 12nm architecture. Unlike other devices in this price range, Huawei has decided to go with a micro USB cable. The device runs on EMUI 9.0 based on Android Pie. In terms of security, there’s no fingerprint sensor, so you need to rely on  face unlock.\xa0   Huawei Y6 Pro 2019 Specifications:   Display : 6.09″ (720x1560px) IPS LCD 19.5:9 aspect ratio panel  OS : Android 9.0 Pie (EMUI 9.0)  SoC : MediaTek MT6761 Helio A22 SoC  Processor : Quad-core 2.0GHz Cortex A53, 12nm architecture  GPU : PowerVR GE8320  RAM : 3GB  Storage : 32GB, expandable up to 512GB via MicroSD card  Back Camera : 13MP, f/1.8 with LED flash,\xa01080p@30fps  Front Camera : 8MP, f/2.0 with LED flash,\xa01080p@30fps  Dimensions : 6.15 x 2.89 x 0.31 inches  Battery : 3020mAh  Connectivity : Bluetooth, Micro USB, Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi Hot Spot  Color option : Midnight Black, Sapphire Blue, Amber Brown  Price in Nepal:  Rs. 16,790  [Price Last Updated On: July 25, 2019]   Huawei Y6 Pro Price in Nepal  The price of Huawei Y6 Pro in Nepal is Rs 16,170.

['OPPO Reno leaked with a unique pop-up selfie camera'],['OPPO'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['March 29, 2019']",2019-03-29 09:31:15+00:00,"['In a quest to remove bezels, we have seen manufacturers come up with extraordinary solutions. From notches ( iPhone X ) to punch hole displays ( Galaxy S10 ) to pop up cameras (Vivo V15). All this, to somehow fit the front facing camera while giving you a bezel-less experience. However, you will now, see something new. OPPO’s newest attempt at a bezel-less smartphone. An unusual wedge-shaped pop-up selfie camera on the newly leaked upcoming smartphone “Reno”.  Flagship Variant  The company’s VP has confirmed  Snapdragon 855  to be the choice of SoC in this one. Liquid cooling is also a feature here, alongside an in-display fingerprint sensor. This particular model will also feature a  triple camera setup , with OPPO’s much anticipated  10x optical zoom . It will be a triple camera setup, which includes the  Sony IMX586 48MP  primary sensor.         Ohh! 5G is also expected to make a presence in one of the variants, with the  Snapdragon X50 modem . Then, there is the Lamborghini edition of this phone, said to boast a staggering  12GB of RAM . Not anything new, but exciting nonetheless. All this on the high-end model, but all these are just leaks at this point. We are expecting multiple variants in this series.  Also Read:  Vivo V15 Pro Review: Pop goes the Selfie!  Standard Variant  The next variant is, a mid-ranger, with the  Snapdragon 710  SoC. It comes with Heat Conductor Gel and a Graphite sheet for heat dissipation. So, a hefty emphasis on cooling, which is not a bad thing. This is also the same variant that we suspect will get that unique pop-up camera module. I can’t quite explain it, so take a look at the video below, that should give you an idea.   Leaked case renders also reveal 3.5 mm headphone jack, speaker grill and USB Type C at the bottom. In-display fingerprint sensor remains uncertain for this one. This variant also has just two cameras at the back, and won’t feature 5G connectivity either. Finally, Android 9 will come pre-installed with either ColorOS 6 on top or whichever skin OPPO decides to put on top.  It should be interesting how Oppo prices these smartphones when they launch on April 10. By the looks of this, pop-up cameras can be the future. But personally, this design should not be the standard. I mean, I do kinda like them, but as for using a case on it, it is a bit impractical. So, do let us know your thoughts on this.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OPPO-Reno-1.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0 2019 launched with mid-range specs and S-Pen support'],"['Samsung', 'Tablet']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['March 29, 2019']",2019-03-29 06:24:42+00:00,"['Apart from  iPads , is buying any other oversized smartphone worth it? And more so, when the market for tablets are going downhill? Well, Samsung probably thinks it is. As, they’re taking strides in the low and mid-range tablet segment. More recently with the launch of its new Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0 2019. The device received a silent launch yesterday. So pricing is yet to be revealed, but do we know what this tablet is capable of.  Judging by the name, it’s an 8″ LCD display with a 1920x1200px resolution. Powered by a humble  Exynos 7904  chipset, it packs 3GB of RAM. As for storage, you get 22 GB user accessible out of the total 32GB, expandable via a microSD card of up to 512GB. S-Pen support is also here, a similar implementation as their Note series.         A 4,200mAh battery assures you 11 hours of web browsing, even on the LTE model. Still, it’s a significant downgrade from its larger sibling. The bottom houses a 3.5mm headphone jack and a USB 2.0 port, in charge of charging the device, file transfers, and audio output. The tablet measures in at 8.9mm of thickness while weighing 325 grams.  There is an 8MP camera at the back, while a 5MP selfie shooter resides on the top bezel. We don’t know what the tablet runs on, as they didn’t reveal the Android version or the skin on top. But its larger sibling, the 10.1-inch Tab A runs on Android 9 with OneUI, so we can definitely expect something similar.  But, Samsung did not compromise on the connectivity front. With Bluetooth 5.0 LE, Wi-Fi ac, and an optional LTE model can you even complain? The tablet will be available in the UK, New Zealand, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam.

['Vivo V15 Pro Review: Pop goes the Selfie!'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Vivo']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['March 29, 2019']",2019-03-29 06:18:34+00:00,"['With the modern smartphones trying so hard to give us the bezel-less experience, I sometimes, wonder, where is this going to end. We’ve seen some pretty crazy stuff over the years. It all started with the  Essential phone  giving us the notch and  iPhone X  making it a trend! Even Samsung, the company, who mocked Apple for their notches, has given in and introduced notches on their low and mid-range phones. And as much as phones adopted that, they’re now trying their best to remove it.  So, at present, we have from  water-drop notches  to  punch-hole displays , to these pop-up cameras! Vivo was the first that brought us these, first in the  Vivo Nex S . The  OPPO Find X , followed suit with sliding cameras, but seems like Pop-up cameras are easier, as the  F11 Pro  adopted it. Plus, phones are also moving to in-display fingerprint sensors. And with that, they are also getting expensive. Vivo’s V-series used to cost less than $300, and now, they cost upwards of  $400 . So, if it isn’t clear, the prices we pay for the “innovation” are increasing. But do we really need them? Is the price just for these gimmicky features, or is there something else, too? Let’s find out in this review of the Vivo V15 Pro.         Vivo V15 Pro Specifications:   Design : Plastic Black with glossy finish, Aluminum frame, dual-tone gradient color  Display : 6.39″ Super AMOLED panel, Full-HD+ resolution (1080 x 2316 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Triple, 48 MP primary with f/1.8 aperture and PDAF + 8 MP Ultra-wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture + 5 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : Motorized pop-up module, 32 MP lens with f/2.0 aperture  Processor : Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 675, 11 nm technology  GPU : Adreno 612  RAM:  6 GB  Storage : 128 GB internal, expandable up to 256 GB via microSD card (dedicated slot)  OS : Android 9.0 Pie with FunTouch OS 9.1  Sensors : Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery : 3700 mAh, 18W Dual-Engine Fast Charging  Price : Rs.52,490 / $407 (international)   Design  The design you see on this one is not new by any means. With a smooth texture, curved edges and tapered sides with the  dual-tone gradient coloring  on a glass-looking plastic body, it’s getting pretty boring. I mean, it’s not bad. It does look good, but we’ve been seeing it on almost all new phones these days, that it’s getting tiring now. The triple camera setup at the back also protrudes out quite a bit, which may not be to everyone’s liking.   The frame of the phone is aluminum, and it seems sturdy too. And even though the phone is large, its slim form factor makes it easy to hold. However, one-handed usage can be a bit of a struggle, due to its size. All the buttons are on the right – both power and volume buttons. And you also get another button on the left – to trigger the  Vivo’s own digital assistant – Jovi . Okay, we are clear about our dislike of the Bixby button on Samsung, and the same goes for this one too! At least, this one can be remapped to Google Assistant. So, not all that useless, but, redundant still.      Vivo V15 Pro design   1  of 5               Front         Left         Right         Top         Bottom                           The headphone jack is at the top, while the bottom houses the speaker grill and a micro USB  port . Yup…still micro USB in 2019 – on a higher end mid-range device. But it is what it is. So, Vivo, if you’re listening, its high time for you to change that. There is the dual SIM slot at the bottom and a microSD card slot on the left.  Let’s also address the elephant in the room…the pop-up selfie camera. With it tucked neatly inside the body, the phone is bezel-less and has the true edge-to-edge display. When you want to use it, it comes out pretty fast, with cool sound effects too!  Nobody asked for motorized parts on their smartphone. But it’s here, anyway. And what worries me is that its easy to get dirt or water inside, and that might break the motor. Many times, you’ll even find dust already accumulating on the camera when you trigger it. Needless to say, it is  not IP certified . And while it may be fun to play with the pop-up camera in the beginning, it does get boring pretty fast.  However, if you’re worried about how durable the motor is, Vivo claims that it is good for around  300,000 pop-ups . So, if you even use it for like 100 times a day, you’re still good for about 8 years!  Display  This phone is a successor to the  Vivo V11 Pro , but the display size on it has gone down slightly. It features a  6.39” Super AMOLED display  with a  Full HD+ resolution ! And the display quality is great! As I said, a true edge-to-edge display without any notches or cutouts or bezels with deep blacks and vibrant colors of AMOLED. Actually, there are a very minimal amount of bezels but are negligible. So, what’s not to like?   The lack of an LED notification light! Yes, that tiny detail matters. It has been absent since the  Vivo V11 Pro , and I guess it won’t be making a comeback. There is an  always-on display  to make up for it, but that won’t really show you all the notifications you get, which is strange and needs to be fixed.  Its  In-display fingerprint sensor  rests at the bottom, which lights up when you lift the phone. And the sensor is as good as Optical Fingerprint sensors go – a bit slower than your traditional physical fingerprint sensors and works only 8 times out of 10. But the viewing experience on this screen is not something you’ll find on most phones these days.  Camera   The triple camera setup at the back consists of a  48 MP primary camera , an  8 MP ultra-wide lens  and a  5 MP depth sensor . However, the 48 MP camera uses a Quad-Bayer filter, so, it uses  pixel binning  to get 12 MP images with plenty of details and less noise. As expected from a Vivo higher-end mid-range device, the camera will not disappoint you in any way. I was thoroughly impressed by its ability to capture details and its sharpness.      Vivo V15 Pro Camera samples   1  of 9               Sample 1         Details         Details         Colors pop         Color accuracy         Indoor lighting         Low light 1         Low Light 2         Object                                       Colors pop out, and are quite accurate as well…in good lighting. However, indoors, they do appear a bit cooler and have a bluish tint to them. Of course, if you want to make it vibrant, there’s always the  AI mode , but that can give you some exaggerated colors. So, use it according to necessity and preference.      Vivo V15 Pro Portrait   1  of 8               Portrait         Normal Portrait         Stereo Light         Loop Light         Monochrome portrait         Monochrome portrait 2         Rainbow effect         Rainbow effect 2                                    Portrait images are also good. Edge detection, as usual, works good enough. The subject and background are perfectly distinguished at first look. Upon zooming in, you can notice slight distortions in the areas like hair and stuff. A cool feature is that the portrait images come with a  set of effects  that can be applied to spice up your images. There’s a  rainbow effect , something called a “ Loop light ” and “ Stereo Light ”, which I don’t understand, but there is a difference between normal portraits and them if you look closely. What I like are the rainbow and monochrome effects. However, the monochrome’s edge detection seems a bit unpolished.      Vivo V15 Pro Normal vs Wide Angle   1  of 6               Normal         Wide Angle         Normal          Wide Angle         Normal         Wide Angle                              The ultra-wide lens is a welcome addition. It comes in handy while capturing sceneries, and also while taking group shots. Image quality on the ultra-wide lens is also good enough but doesn’t pack as many details as the primary. That is, a given, but these images also seemed pretty color accurate to me.      Vivo V15 Pro Night mode   1  of 4               Normal         Night Mode         Normal         Night Mode                        There are also night shots, which, of course, mean long exposure shots. But while they work most times, sometimes, you’ll be better off without them.   Okay, let’s get to the selfies! And pop it goes…By that, I mean, selfies on the  32 MP Pop-camera  are great – they pack details, and are sharp. But it shares the same problem as the Vivo V11 Pro. Even without the Beauty mode off, you cannot get natural selfies. The camera tends to smoothen your skin, and makes you look “made-up”. If you turn the AI Beauty mode on, then, be prepared for a whole new level of artificiality. So, if you don’t like the selfie camera, I don’t blame you. I am not a fan of it either.      Vivo V15 Pro Selfie   1  of 5                                    Beauty Mode off         Beauty Mode on                           The  AI Beauty mode  here is buffed up. And by buffed up, I mean, it’s virtually like Photoshopping your face in real time. You can adjust almost all your facial features – from the forehead to jaws, to eyes, nose, and everything. Talk about fake tinder profiles!  You can also take 4K videos at 30 frames per second, but then again, with no image stabilization, the usability is limited. Plus, there’s also the Slow-mo, which is not Super slow-mo, but just a bit slow. Nevertheless, its an improvement over the V11 Pro.  For high-resolution camera samples ,   click here>>  Performance  The Vivo V15 Pro packs the  Snapdragon 675  with  6 GB RAM  inside. And that makes for a zippy performance. Being one of the first phones with a Snapdragon 675, it leaves most other mid-rangers in the water. The 675 is based on  11 nm architecture , unlike other 14 nm processors in the 600 series, and that has paid off.  Vivo V15 Pro Benchmarks   Geekbench v4.3.2   Single-core: 2397  Multi-core: 6608    AnTuTu v7:   179379    3D Mark   Slingshot Extreme Open GLES 3.1: 1064  Slingshot Extreme Vulkan: 1159    PC Mark   Work 2.0: 7571    Andro Bench   Sequential Read: 311.72 MB/s  Sequential Write: 190.1 MB/s     Most tasks run super-fast. Apps load quickly, too, and it can keep them open in the background for a long time as well. Gaming on it also a lot of fun, because it is smooth, but mostly, because of the screen. The large end-to-end display really makes for a great gaming experience. PUBG runs on HD settings in high frame rates, and it runs without any hiccups or lags. Games like Asphalt 9 and Need For Speed have no problem running smoothly, either.  Facial Recognition is done through the pop-up selfie camera. There is  no IR sensor  like in the V11 Pro. So, it won’t work very well in the dark. The time taken by the selfie camera to pop-out and unlock your phone is also super-fast, when it works. But it can actually be annoying, because if you want to just look at the time, then, the camera pops out and tries to get a reading every time. So, you either have to turn it off, or have the always-on display, that eats up your battery. And yes, it has the same problem that the V11 Pro had.  It can unlock your phone with Facial Recognition, even with your face half-covered!  So, it still needs to work on that security front.  It runs on  Android Pie  but has its own  FunTouch OS 9  on it. And we’ve said it before – this iPhone clone of a UI is not something to like. I mean, it makes for a half-baked iOS experience. There is plenty of bloatware, and no app drawer, as usual, but the good thing is that they added a search button for Settings. So, I guess, mild improvements are on the way.  Battery and Storage  As for the battery, this one comes with a good-sized  3700 mAh unit , and the battery life on it is fantastic. It lasts quite a bit, even with the Always-On display turned on. Maybe it’s the power-efficient chipset, but even with light gaming, frequent social media usage, and stuff, at the end of the day, you’ll still have about 40% remaining.  Also, you get the  Dual Engine Fast Charging  feature on it, but it stays the same as last years. It isn’t that impressive, as it does still take  nearly 2 hours to fully charge , which is what most phones have these days. But the battery life makes up for that.  As for storage, you get a  128 GB internal storage , both in the base variant and one with 8 GB RAM. As much as that can be adequate, you also get a microSD card slot, so, no complaints on that front, either.  Conclusion  So, what do I think of the Vivo V15 Pro? Actually, my opinion about this phone remains unchanged from the Vivo V11 Pro. This phone, with its Pop-up selfie camera, triple rear cameras and the large bezel-less screen looks cool and futuristic. Maybe, pop-up cameras will be the trend now, as Oppo F11 Pro is also on this train. But besides that, has it really got it all?  Sure, the performance front is unparalleled against most mid-rangers, but there’s also the  Redmi Note 7 Pro  with similar performance, for cheap, without all the bells and whistles and half-baked extras. For a price of  around $430 , or  Rs.52,490  in Nepal, is it really that compelling?   To those who love to have a ton of extra features at their disposal, and something to show off, or even a truly Infinity display, yes. Yes, it is. I, initially, liked this device a lot, but after using it for a while, I began to think, “do I really need all this?” I couldn’t decide, but maybe you can. If you think you want all of the bling, this looks like a good phone. But if you can do without this artsy-show-off stuff, there are other affordable options out there.  But the big question here is that, are Pop-up cameras the future? Is the true bezel-less design worth sacrificing your IP68 rating, if other phones adopt it, for instance? So, this question is open for debate. Do let us know your thoughts on this.

['Asus Vivobook S14 Review – Practical? Yes… Exciting? No!'],"['Asus', 'Reviews', 'Vivobook Series']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['March 28, 2019']",2019-03-28 11:40:37+00:00,"['Here’s the thing. There are great laptops, good laptops, and bad laptops. And only a handful can be called great. Most of them can only remain in a good category. We have one similar laptop here – the  ASUS Vivobook S14 S430U , or just S14, in short. This is an ultra-book that came out in the first quarter of 2018. Let’s talk about if this ultra-book is still relevant.   Asus Vivobook S14 Specifications:   Design : Polycarbonate, Shiny metallic finish, Protrusion on the lid, 1.4 kg  Display : 14″ LED-backlit Full-HD matte display (1920 x 1080), 57% NTSC Color Gamut  Keyboard : Chiclet Keyboard, 3-level back-lighting, No num-pad  Trackpad : Glass surface trackpad, (PTP technology), Fingerprint sensor with Windows Hello  Ports : 1 x Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 1, 1 x Type-A USB 3.1, 2 x USB 2.0, 1 x HDMI, 1 x audio jack, 1 x microSD card reader  Wireless connectivity : Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth V4.2  Processor : 1.6 GHz 8 th -gen Intel i5-8250U  RAM:  8 GB DDR4 @ 2400 MHz  Graphics : GTX MX150 graphics, 2 GB VRAM  Battery : 40 Watt-hour, Fast Charging – 60% in 49 minutes  Storage : 1 TB HDD  Price : Rs.110,000    BUY HERE  Design and Build  Ultrabooks are generally, more or less, the same. They’re mostly known for their compact design, sleek looks, and lightweight. And this one is the same. It looks like any other ultrabook out there. Its  mostly plastic , but has a  brushed metal finish , both inside and out, to give a premium look and feel.         The only thing that sets it apart is a bit of  protrusion on the lid  that extends a bit beyond the base. That raises the base of the laptop slightly when opened, which  improves air-flow  underneath. It improves both the thermals and prevents your lap from getting roasted from the heat. Plus, this means you can use it easily while laying on your bed too.   Being a  14-inch model , it sacrifices a separate number-pad, but does leave out big spaces on the sides of the keyboard, which looks kinda unnecessary. The brushed lid texture attracts finger smudges quite a lot, but that’s very common, so, can’t complain.   At  1.4 kg , this isn’t your lightest ultra-book. I like  Acer Swift 5  in terms of weight and portability. But being slightly heavy gives it a bit more sturdiness – there’s only slight flexes on the lid and the keyboard deck. So, you can say it maintains the balance between portability and build.  Ports      Asus Vivobook S14 Ports   1  of 2               Ports Left         Ports Right                  Ultrabooks are not known for a great selection of ports. And this one, tries to. With  three USB-As , one of which is a  USB 3.0 , a  USB-C (without Thunderbolt 3) , an  HDMI , an  audio jack  and a  microSD card slot , the selection of ports is okay. But the microSD port looks a bit less practical. I mean, if you’re into editing and stuff, a regular SD card slot would be a lot more usable.  Keyboard and Trackpad  When you look at the keyboard, something about it gives a bit of a cheap vibe. Maybe it’s the hard silver color, but I don’t look how it looks.   On the other hand, the typing experience is just the opposite. With  ample key travel  and a good amount of spacing between the keys, typing is pretty comfortable. Also, there’s a good amount of tactile feedback on them.\xa0 There is also  3-level back-lighting , but that doesn’t look aesthetically pleasing. And the  half-sized arrow keys  will take some getting used to, but that’s how ultra-book keyboards are.   I also liked the trackpad. Its glass surface is very smooth and tracking is fairly accurate. The size is also great for an ultrabook, and it does a good job with gestures as well. You also get a  fingerprint sensor  on it, with Windows Hello feature, but that is optional, though.  Overall, if you don’t judge the keyboard by its looks, it’s actually good enough.  Display  As for the display, this laptop features a  Full HD IPS LCD panel . It feels like the de-facto standard for ultrabooks. The screen offers decent brightness levels and good viewing angles. However, it is not bright enough to be used in well-lit areas.   The color gamut coverage is where it falls short. With only  57% NTSC Color Gamut Coverage , this display is too dull to be used for editing stuff. It is fine for working and media consumption; even gaming – (for what games are playable), but this is not something I’d recommend for any kind of content creation. If you just use it for normal office usage and watching movies, there is nothing to complain about.  One thing I like about the display is that the bezels on the laptop are fairly slim. An even so, the webcam is exactly where it should be – at the top.  Performance  As far as ultrabooks’ performance is concerned, this one could use quite a bit of tuning. The hardware choice is great. You get the  1.6 GHz 8 th -gen Intel i5-8250U processor . And it is backed by  8 GB of DDR4 2400 MHz RAM . On paper, that should make it zippy enough for a power efficient processor.  But the bottleneck here is its choice of an HDD rather than an SSD. Now, there are SSD variants for a higher price, but this model here only has an HDD. And if you’re coming from an SSD, then, you’ll find it very very annoying to use.  Get this for instance. If you’re someone like me who opens your Google Chrome first whenever you start your laptop, it’ll take like 20-30 seconds to fully open it. So, you need a bit of patience to work with it.  But once it loads up, then, it’s fast enough. You can have like 15 tabs open on your browser, and it’ll still hold its own. Using Photoshop is also smooth enough, but I didn’t do any video editing on it because of its color constraints. So, no telling if it can handle that.  Light gaming is supported by its dedicated  GTX MX150 graphics  with  2 GB V-RAM . Now that is an entry-level graphics card, so, don’t think you can play a lot of games on it. Games like FIFA and CS:GO can give you acceptable frame rates on medium settings while PUBG is barely playable at the lowest of settings. Dota 2 runs okay, and other than that, there aren’t many games you can play on it.  And even that needs some patience as you’re loading the games from your HDD. So, do yourselves a favor and get the SSD variant. Or even if you get one with an HDD, you can install an SSD as it does come with an M.2 SSD slot.  Battery  For an ultrabook, the battery is pretty average on it. You get a  40 Watt-hour battery , and that’s actually good for an ultra-book. But even so, I got only about  4 hours of battery life  at most with my standard office usage.  Maybe it’s the sluggish HDD that eats up the power because I got about 6 hours on the Acer Swift 5 which has a slightly smaller battery of 36 Watt-hours. And since it doesn’t last a typical office day, you’ll need to carry your charger with you. So, it’s a good thing that the charger is as small as a phone charger.  Plus, it has got a  Fast Charging feature  in it, which can charge your laptop fully in some 1.5 hours. That’s something you don’t get on many laptops – and having one is very convenient.  Thermals  A power efficient processor can only do so much, so, the thermals aren’t a very concerning matter here. It can get a bit warm, but the ventilation is efficient due to the design.  Verdict  Something that really disappointed me in this laptop is the speakers. They are really quiet. If you’re working a full load and your fans are acting up, the speakers can easily get subdued. And if you’re watching movies or so, you should make sure nothing very heavy is running in the background.  To sum up, the Asus Vivobook S14 430U is just like any other ultrabook out there. It is practical with its thermal management, design and builds, enough ports, and okay performance. But this is not a very exciting device. I mean, nothing really stands out apart from the efficient heat management design. I cannot help but compare it to the Acer Swift 5, mostly because of the similar prices. And to me, that stands out because of its featherweight, while doing most things similar to better than this one.  If you get the SSD variant, you will like it, though. This is a laptop to get if you’re an office worker yet have to move around mostly. It is not suitable for content creators, though because of the display, but for the regular layman who wants an ultra-book, you can go for it.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/asus-vivobook-s14-review.jpg']

In the case of ultraportables, it seems like  Apple’s MacBook  is the benchmark for all. We don’t disagree, it’s a really great laptop and even I would totally consider it if not for their price. This is where companies like Xiaomi or Huawei comes in, and today it’s the turn of the former to take a try. With their newly launched product, the  MI Notebook Air 2019 , can they give us a worthy MacBook alternative? Let’s find more about it along with the price and expected availability.  Overview  Currently only available in China, the Mi NoteBook Air (2019) get an all-metal chassis while  weighing just 1.07 Kgs . The display size comes in at  12.5-inches  with a Full-HD resolution and a bezel size of just 0.22-inches. You get Harmon Kardon audio and fast charging support on all models. Xiaomi claims it can  charge 50% in just 35 minutes , but failed to announce its actual capacity. As for connectivity, you have USB C, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3.5mm audio jack, USB 3.0, and HDMI at your disposal.         Internally, the choice of Core-M processors might not be so exciting, but consider a  price of approx. $536 , the m3-8100Y might not seem so bad. That’s the base model which gets a 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. BTW, there are three models currently on sale, and  none of them come with anything over 4GB of RAM,  which is a bit disappointing. We reckon a larger RAM sized variant is currently in the works. As for the rest of the models, you can compare them in this neat table below.  8th Gen processors are the way to go for now. Intel should seriously hurry up with its next-gen mobile processors. And judging by what we have right now, the 4GB of maximum RAM is a real problem here, but apart from that, the pricing is spot on.  Mi NoteBook Air (2019) Price & Availability:  Sales of the Mi Notebook Air 2019 have already begun in China. The base variant of the Mi Notebook Air starts at a price of US$536 (approx Rs. 60,000 in Nepal). This price is for the base Core M3 CPU, 4GB RAM, and 128GB Storage.

['Xiaomi reveals 100-watt charging: Takes only 17 minutes to charge a 4000mAh battery'],"['Xiaomi', 'Redmi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 28, 2019']",2019-03-28 07:33:57+00:00,"['Innovations in the smartphone arena seem to be somewhat stagnant, looking at the recent years. Other than cameras, smartphone manufacturers barely seem to focus on other aspects. When it comes to charging technology, big players like Samsung and Apple are reiterating the same tech for a considerable amount of time. Up until now, Oppo and Huawei with their  50-watt  and  55-watt charging technology,  were the leaders in fast charging tech. However, Xiaomi surpassed both of them by introducing a new charging standard; which can inject power to the battery at double the rate than the former bests. Yes, you heard it right! Dubbed as  Super Charge Turbo   Standard , this new charging technology can push  100-watt power  in a smartphone’s battery. Looks like they went all out in naming the tech, itself!   Demonstrating this awesome technology, Xiaomi co-founder  Bin Lin posted a video in Weibo . In the video, Lin compared the charging test of an unnamed Xiaomi handset with 4000 mAh to the Oppo R17 Pro, with 3700 mAh battery. The  Oppo R17 Pro  comes with a bi-cell battery design. It means that two 1850 mAh batteries are stacked together in series making a total capacity of 3700 mAh. And this device charges at 50-watt charging speed. While comparing the R17 Pro against the Xiaomi’s unnamed smartphone, the R17 Pro only reached 65% mark when Xiaomi device filled to 100%. And  Xiaomi handset took only 17 minutes to get to that level!        This is surely amazing. Since most of the smartphones come with slow charging speed, it takes a lot of time to get the devices fully charged. And that problem is realized even more when you are in a hurry. With this new Super Charge Turbo technology, a  4000 mAh battery can charge up to 50% just in 7 minutes!  And that could be enough for a day for most of the users on normal use. So I am really eager to see the tech implemented on the commercial phones.  However, we don’t have any sort of a time-line as to when this tech will be available commercially. However, Redmi President, Lu Weibing revealed that Redmi would be the first one to mass-produce Xiaomi 100-watt fast charger.  As fascinating as the technology sounds, safety is equally important while supplying a high amount of power in small and compact devices like a smartphone. In the case of Oppo,  TÜV Rheinland  has certified the handset marking it as a safe device to use. TÜV Rheinland is a German safety authority, which specializes in testing, inspection, and certification to ensure the safety of products. We haven’t yet heard about Xiaomi receiving such certifications. However, Xiaomi might consider that before getting it ready for mass production. Otherwise, the Redmi phone with a 100-watt fast charging could end up being another  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 !']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/xiaomis-100-watt-charger.jpg']

Flagship after flagship they have delivered, and one of their standout features has been the camera. This time around, the  P30 Pro’s  cameras scored a new high of 112 points, given by none other than DxOMark. The score beats out its own elder sibling, the Mate 20 Pro, the Galaxy S10 and its direct predecessor, the P20 Pro by 3 whole points.  Rear Cameras  Let’s take a look at the P30 pro’s four camera setup first:   40 MP, f/1.6, 27mm (wide), 1/1.7″, PDAF, OIS  20 MP, f/2.2, 16mm (ultrawide), 1/2.7″, PDAF  Periscope 8 MP, f/3.4, 125mm (telephoto), 1/4″, 5x optical zoom, OIS, PDAF  TOF 3D camera   So the primary camera is a 40MP quad sensor with an f/1.6 aperture lens that produces 10MP photos by default. It’s a 27mm equivalent lens with optical stabilization and a sensor size of 1/1.7″. This one uses RYB filter instead of your typical RGB Bayer-filter on most phones. Basically, this exchanges the Green pixels for Yellow, which in turn results in 40% more light getting into the sensor (so better low light shots). Huawei calls this the  SuperSpectrum .         The second, an  Ultrawide  20MP camera with an f/2.2 aperture. It’s a 16mm lens, same as the one we saw on the Mate 20 Pro. It has a 120-degree field of view, a must have for any flagship these days. According to the review, night mode has been improved this time around for the ultra-wide lens. Then there is the  Time Of Flight  camera for better depth mapping.  And finally, the telephoto camera, aka the  Periscope lens . This allows you to reach 5x lossless optical zoom. As for the video capabilities, it scored 97 points, same as the Mate 20 Pro but a point lower than the P20 Pro for a few reasons. To summarize the video quality, it gets one of the best video stabilization, maintains good rendering of textures and details, but isn’t the best in low lights.  Also Read:  Redmi Note 7 Pro is not coming to Nepal  Front Camera  Apart from the back cameras, the front selfie shooter tucked into the notch should play a huge role in one’s buying decision. Sadly, the P30 Pro lacks a bit on that front. The phone sits comfortably at the 4th spot, right below the Note 9, Pixel 3 and the selfie leader Galaxy S10. With a score of 89 points, the 32MP quad-Bayer sensor is good, just not the best in the business.  Conclusion  DxOMark has praised the P30 Pro’s zoom feature heavily, also claiming that its bokeh effects are the best on a smartphone. The noise levels and image details were also found to be excellent. They did specify some areas the phone could do with a bit more improvements, but as it stands, the Huawei P30 Pro is the best camera phone in the market. We will surely test it out in our full review very soon.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-P30-pro-.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy A50 Review: A benchmark for the mid-range smartphones?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 27, 2019']",2019-03-27 12:04:44+00:00,"['In 2019, Samsung flooded the entry-level and mid-range segment with a number of phones. Although the latest Samsung smartphones are too hard to keep track of, I was particularly intrigued with the  Samsung Galaxy A50 . Since it’s the least expensive smartphone in Nepal with triple rear cameras and an in-display fingerprint sensor, I was really eager to test how the device really fares on real-life use. And so, this is my Samsung Galaxy A50 review after two weeks of use.  Samsung Galaxy A50 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display  Resolution:\xa0 Full-HD+ (2340×1080 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio @ 403PPI  Chipset:\xa0 Exynos 9610 Octa  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core (4×2.3 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.6 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU: \xa0Mali-G71 MP3  RAM:\xa0 4GB  Storage:\xa0 64GB; Expandable up to 512GB (Dedicated SD Card Slot)  OS & UI:\xa0 Android 9.0 (Pie) with Samsung’s OneUI on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Triple camera – (25 MP, f/1.7, PDAF) + (8 MP, f/2.2, 12mm, (ultrawide)) + (5 MP, f/2.2, depth sensor), LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 25MP, f/2.0  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (under display), Gyro, accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 4000mAh with 15watt fast charging support; USB Type-C port  Colors:\xa0 Blue, White, Coral, and Black  Price:  Rs. 33,490  Rs. 26,699   Design  Let’s start the things with its design. Most of the midrange Samsung smartphones released in 2018 had a bland and outdated design, which looked like they were brought straight from 2015. But in the Galaxy A50, it’s a whole different story. The handset comes with a Glasstic back and a plastic frame. Apparently, Glasstic is the combination of Glass and Plastic molded together. With such kind of setup, the back feels as premium as glass yet weighs light as plastic. I really want to appreciate the trick Samsung used here to maintain the ergonomics.         The device is very comfortable to hold, despite having a big battery and its curvy edges aids in the grip. The shimmering rainbow effect on the back is also a unique touch here, and looks absolutely appealing!  Although the Glasstic back has its own perks, it is also a proficient fingerprint magnet. And it’s really annoying. Plus the urge to clean the smudges is also quite a pain in the neck.   Having a plastic frame and a Glasstic body, I am concerned about the durability of the handset in the long run. But I did not notice any creaks and bends on my use. However, there were some minor scratches at the back. To avoid that, you can put on a silicone case. And since it comes inside the box, you don’t have to spend extra bucks for the protection.  Display  On the display front, the phone gets a  6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel . When I reviewed the  Galaxy M10  and  M20 , I was missing the deeper blacks and brighter whites of the AMOLED screen. And it’s finally back in the A50. The contrast ratio is not the only thing to be excited here. The tall and immersive display also deserves a fair bit of praise. It comes with a small notch on the top, which Samsung likes to call an “Infinity-U display”. The tiny notch in this device is less obtrusive so I didn’t have any issues at all. I would have preferred a smaller chin here. But since it’s a midrange phone, this is not something I can fuss about.   In an attempt to shrink down the bezels, Samsung also gave away the LED notification light. But it has an always-on display feature as the replacement. Since this feature displays all sorts of notifications, current time and date even on an off-screen, I find it more useful. However, it consumes more power than an LED indicator. So, you will have to sacrifice a fair amount of battery juice for this feature.   With Full-HD+ resolution at its disposal, the contents on the screen look really sharp. Color accuracy is also amazing and the viewing angle is decent in a similar fashion. There is also an in-display fingerprint sensor on the device. But I will get into that later.  Camera  Moving on to the camera side, a triple camera setup resides on the back. The rear camera setup comprises of a 25MP primary shooter backed by an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens and a 5MP depth sensor. The setup looks quite familiar with last year’s  Galaxy A7 2018 . But unlike the last year’s model, I found the camera on the Galaxy A50 to be slightly better. The colors are slightly more accurate than last year’s model as well. And the dynamic range is also quite appreciable here. However, details were not as crisp as the images from other smartphones available at a similar price.   I also noticed that the resolution of the image to be around 12 Megapixels. Since Samsung has not spoken anything about the pixel binning or any sort of pixel merging technology, I couldn’t understand what’s going on here. But if you want to capture the high-res 25MP images, you can toggle the aspect ratio in the camera UI to “3:4H”. But when I do so, I didn’t notice any changes in the image quality and sharpness.      Galaxy A50 Rear camera Sample (Primary)   1  of 10                      Ultra Wide-angle                       Normal         Normal         Normal                Normal         Normal                                          Talking about the ultra-wide-angle lens, I found it to be quite good. Although the images don’t pack plenty of details, the color accuracy was really good. I, actually, found it to be much better than the primary shooter. Just look at the images shown below. The red t-shirt of my friend looks oversaturated from the primary camera whereas the color looks natural in the ultra-wide-angle image.      Galaxy A50  Normal  Vs Wide Angle   1  of 12               Normal         Ultra Wide-angle         Normal         Ultra Wide-angle         Normal         Ultra Wide-angle         Normal         Ultra Wide-angle         Normal         Ultra Wide-angle         Normal         Ultra Wide-angle                                                The depth sensor, as the name implies, pulls in the depth information, and comes into action while capturing the portrait images. The portrait images look better than what we saw on the Galaxy M10 and M20. But edge detection is still not perfect. I noticed improper edge detection on multiple occasions, which Samsung needs to improve in its upcoming phones.      Portrait Images   1  of 4                                                          As far as the front camera is concerned, a 25MP selfie shooter handles the job while taking selfies and video calls. In terms of images, the 25MP selfie camera here also captures 12-megapixel photos by default, just like the primary rear camera. But you can toggle the aspect ratio to “3:4H” to get high-res 25MP shots.   Ignoring the resolution, I am pretty impressed with the selfies. The colors in the selfies look natural and match my taste. But while capturing portrait selfies, the software over-smoothens the skin, due to which, it looks unnatural at times. The edge detection is also not particularly impressive.      Normal  Selfie Vs Portrait Selfie   1  of 6               Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie                              When it comes to videos, the phone can capture up to Full-HD videos, both from the 25MP main camera and 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera. Although the videos look decent from both the lenses, I liked the colors from ultra-wide-angle one. Since more part of the subject remains in the frame, the subject always seems to be the focus. However, the Autofocus from the primary camera is laggy and takes time while capturing videos. So, the videos can look jittery because of it. But in terms of stabilization, I found the primary shooter doing a better job. And there is EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) to handle that duty.  Apart from the normal video recording, the Galaxy A50 also comes with Slow Motion, Super Slo-Mo, and Hyperlapse features. With the Super Slo-Mo feature, you can capture some moments at 240 frames per second. This is quite a premium feature for a midrange phone.  For high-res images,  Click here .  Performance  In the midrange segment, Samsung mostly lags on the performance side. But things have been a bit different lately. The smartphone comes with  Exynos 9610 chipset , aided by 4GB of RAM. The  10nm  chipset is the first to show up on any Samsung smartphone. The Octa-core CPU here uses four Cortex A-73 performance cores and four Cortex A-53 power-efficient cores. Although this setup looks similar to the Kirin 710 and  Helio P70 chipsets , the Exynos 9610 outperforms both of them when it comes to the real-life use. Just look at these benchmark scores. The Exynos 9610 chip on the Galaxy A50 has a better score than the  Vivo V15  and the  Honor 8X  in AnTuTu, 3D Mark, and GeekBench’s test. So I would have to say that the choice of the chipset is really appreciable here.       Vivo V15  (MediaTek Helio P70)  Realme 2 Pro (4/64GB)  (Snapdragon 660)  Samsung Galaxy A50\xa0 (Exynos 9610)    AnTuTu v7  143452  128703  146360    GeekBench 4.3.2\xa0 (Single Core)  1542  1468  1719    GeekBench 4.3.2\xa0 (Multi-Core)  5751  5506  5554    3D Mark  (OpenGL ES 3.1)  1268  1229  1303    3D Mark  (Vulkan)  1252  1184  1394    PC Mark  (Work 2.0)  8147  5778  5576    Android Bench  (Seq.

Write Speed)  175.7 MB/s  173.76 MB/s  189.92 MB/s      Let’s skip the geeky things and talk about how the device really fared on my day to day use. On my use, light apps and games ran without any issues. And multitasking and switching between apps were fairly smooth. The phone did not sigh even while playing the high-end games. I played graphics-intensive games like PUBG and Shadowgun Legends and both of them ran without any issues. PUBG stuttered sometimes while playing on high settings but I don’t know for sure if it was my internet or the phone. So I have to say that, the phone performed well on my tests. But Asphalt 9 was incompatible with this device, which I am not pleased about. Other than that, I have to nothing to complain about.  The device comes with 64GB of onboard memory, which is quite sufficient for my kind of usage. But even in the case of insufficiency, users can use the SD card. Samsung has provided a dedicated slot for the SD card, so users don’t have to eject the second SIM card out to expand the memory.  Software & UI  Talking about the software, the phone runs on the latest Android Pie out of the box. Samsung also gives its own touch on the software, adding One UI version 1.1 on top. And unlike Touchwiz and Experience UI, the One UI is really optimized. There is less bloatware and most of them can be uninstalled or disabled easily. Although the UI looks polished, some apps have cartoonish icons, which do not look good at all.   Keeping the things of the icons and bloatware aside, I genuinely liked how Samsung has focused on the User Experience in this new UI. The UI is easy to use. Navigating through the setting can be performed even with a single hand. That could be one of the reasons why the UI was named as One UI. Apart from that, Samsung has also enriched the phone with plenty of features. Among the bunch, I liked the Bluelight filter and Night Mode option very much.        1  of 2               Night mode off         Night mode on                  Since these features prevent you from eye-stress, I recommend using these features to our followers. Plus turning on the Night mode also saves the battery juice since the Super AMOLED display does not consume power at all when the pixels are black.  Oh, I almost forgot. If you prefer gestures over the on-screen navigation buttons, there is an option to toggle that option as well.  Security  On the security side, the phone comes with Face Unlock and fingerprint sensor apart from the usual security stuff. And as I mentioned earlier, the fingerprint sensor in this device rests under the display. And it is the least expensive phone with that fancy feature. But unlike the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus, the fingerprint sensor on this device is an optical one and not an ultrasonic one.  Although unlocking the device by tapping on the screen looks cool, the fingerprint sensor is rather slow on the Galaxy A50. It takes over second to unlock the device, which is quite frustrating. During my review period, I received an update on the fingerprint sensor. I expected a boost in the unlocking speed after the update. But I barely noticed any changes after the update. I found the Face Unlock feature to be much faster. So I had to rely on the Face Unlock feature most of the time. However, it’s not all that accurate.  Audio  On the audio front, the phone comes with a single bottom-firing speaker. And the sound output from this device is fairly loud. The speaker on the device also outputs a decent amount of mids and treble. When it comes to bass, it’s very subtle and not noticeable at times. The audio output started getting shrill at higher volumes. So, I just felt the audio output of the speaker to be okay at best.   But listening to music via headphones is a different story. The phone comes with a Dolby Atmos option, with which you can get better separation between the left and the right channels. With the Dolby Atmos mode turned on, I also noticed a boost in the audio volume. In addition to that, the Dolby Atmos feature also adds quite a depth in the music. So, I really enjoyed listening to songs via headphones in the Galaxy A50.  Battery  Moving on to the battery, a massive 4000mAh battery acts as a powerhouse in this device. With a big battery at its disposal, the phone also provides an amazing battery backup. On my normal day of use, the phone lasted for more than a day. At the end of the day, I always found the battery level to be 30% or more. So I must honestly praise the power efficient Super AMOLED display and Samsung’s optimizations on the software front to extend the battery life. If you are unsatisfied with the battery life, you can turn on the Power Mode and Ultra Power Saving Mode to prolong the backup to some extent.   When it comes to charging, you can refuel the device with a 15-watt charging. Although a 15-watt charger is not the fastest at this price range, it is commendable to see Samsung’s generosity in the midrange segment. Because even the flagship Galaxy phones also come with the same wattage of the charger. The phone took exactly one hour and 48 minutes on my charging test, which I consider decent.  Verdict  The Samsung Galaxy A50 is a good phone at this price and ticks lot of right boxes. Vibrant Super AMOLED display, long-lasting battery, optimized UI, and capable chipset are rare features at this price. Although the in-display fingerprint sensor is more or less of a gimmick, it is still a fancy feature to have on a phone. With these nifty features, the Galaxy A50 is surely one of the best midrange phones in Nepal at the moment. And since the  Redmi Note 7 Pro is confirmed not to land in Nepal  and the  Vivo V15  is slightly on the expensive side, the Galaxy A50 would be the phone to consider under Rs. 35,000 price segment.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/samsung-galaxy-a50-review.jpg']
['Redmi Note 7 Pro is not coming to Nepal'],"['Xiaomi', 'Redmi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 27, 2019']",2019-03-27 09:53:24+00:00,"['Since the day Xiaomi launched the  Redmi Note 7  and  Note 7 Pro , it took the smartphone market by storm. Yet even for lower midrange handsets, these smartphones packed plentiful of amazing features. Among the two, the Redmi Note 7 Pro was the more desired one. The smartphone packs  Snapdragon 675  chipset, which is only found in the premium midrange territory. Also, the  48 MP camera  was another impressive feature to create a buzz. Apart from camera and processor, the handset also embraces some premium-tier specs. Most of us were eagerly waiting for its launch in Nepal. But all those hopes shattered when we found out the device is not making its way to Nepal.   Yes, you read that right. It won’t be coming to the country. The argument could be Nepal may be a small market for smartphone sales. But not just in Nepal, that smartphone will not land in any other countries apart from India and China. We don’t know specifics about the Xiaomi’s product strategy but this verdict has already been passed by the Xiaomi officials. John Chen, Xiaomi’s Regional Director for Southeast Asia, in his recent Facebook post announced that the phone will not make a debut on the global scale.         This is truly saddening. Since there were rumors about the device to launch very soon, we were really excited about it. And this is a loss for Xiaomi as well. The phone was remarked as the midrange killer by many reviewers. And many of them had also recommended the handset to their followers. So, now, other smartphone brands will take its place and will make sales. For a quick example, the  Samsung Galaxy A50  probably can remain unrivaled at its price for a long time.  And we are not sure, but there are rumors that Xiaomi is working on a global variant of the  MI 9 SE . The MI 9 SE comes with  Snapdragon 712 SoC , which is said to be slightly better than the Snapdragon 675. Apart from that, the phone gets a 5.97-inch Super AMOLED display. So, it should be more vibrant than on the Note 7 Pro. The MI 9 SE also comes with a triple rear camera, which is an upgrade over the 7 Pro as well. The base variant of the MI 9 SE comes with 6GB RAM and 64GB of onboard memory.  Xiaomi MI 9 SE looks and is similar to the Note 7 Pro in most of the areas, even better in some aspects. However, the battery on the MI 9 SE is only a 3070 mAh battery, which is a pure downgrade. Although the MI 9 SE offers superior specs over the Note 7 Pro. The Note 7 Pro, however, offers better value for money. For the 6 GB/128 GB variant, MI 9 SE costs 2,299 Yuan ($340) whereas the Note 7 Pro demands 1,599 Yuan ($240). So that replacement won’t be convincing.  What do you make of this news? Were you as excited for this device, too? Or do you think it was just over-hyped? Do let us know.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-7-Pro.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy A30 Review – A breath of Fresh Air for Samsung!'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['March 27, 2019']",2019-03-27 08:33:09+00:00,"['With Samsung refreshing its budget and mid-range lineups, the  Galaxy A30  and  A50  are the first to surface. And you’ll immediately notice that these phones are a breath of fresh air for Samsung. Today, we’ll be looking at the Galaxy A30 closely. And see if this low-tier mid-range phone can keep up with the cut-throat competition that surrounds it.  Samsung Galaxy A30 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display  Resolution:\xa0 Full-HD+ (2340×1080 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio @ 403PPI  Chipset:\xa0 Exynos 7904 Octa  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core (2×1.8 GHz Cortex-A73 & 6×1.6 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU: \xa0Mali-G71 MP2  RAM:\xa0 4GB  Storage:\xa0 64GB; Expandable up to 512GB (Dedicated SD Card Slot)  OS & UI:\xa0 Android 9.0 (Pie) with Samsung’s OneUI on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual camera – (16 MP, f/1.7, PDAF) + (5 MP, f/2.2, 12mm, (ultrawide)), LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 16MP, f/2.0  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 4000mAh with 15watt fast charging support; USB Type-C port  Colors:\xa0 Blue, White, and Black  price:\xa0 Rs. 28,490   Design  While the design of the phone is not something we haven’t seen before, it is new for Samsung. But I’ll tell you what is the first of its kind – its “Glastic” body! That is the construction of plastic and glass molded together. And it’s not as slippery as glass but is as durable as plastic. So, you get the best of both worlds. But it is, however, a fingerprint magnet.         The phone is large but has curved edges and tapered sides. So, it sits comfortably in your hand. It’s also not bulky and seems a bit lightweight, but is sturdy enough. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is also at the right spot and is fairly easy to reach.   By the looks of it, it appears as if Samsung put quite a bit of thought on this one. It looks cool, and is something you can show-off! Only those who don’t like such bigass phones might not like it, but for others, it is very likable.  Display  The display on it is a joy to use! It’s an AMOLED panel, so, not something you’ll find in others for the price. That already gives it an advantage over the competition. So, I think it’s safe to say that this is the best display around for the price category.  Its large 6.4” panel with Full HD+ resolution makes for a good viewing experience. It’s sharp, colors are punchy and vibrant, and there is not much you can complain about. There’s also ample brightness and is easy to operate outdoors under bright sunlight as well.   The notch is small, and U-shaped. Samsung dubs this the Infinity-U, and it looks…a bit odd, to be honest. Notches aren’t my thing, but those V-shaped notches look, better than the U-shaped ones. There’s a minimal amount of bezels around the sides, but there is a chin though, which, frankly looks disturbing.  One thing I’d like to mention is that the night mode, paired with AMOLED technology should provide more battery life. But, more than that, what it gives you, is a more immersive user experience with more depth! Everything is inky black, and that makes it so much better.   Plus, if you’re not a fan of Samsung’s color calibration, they also give you a bunch of modes to suit your needs. So, overall, a display that’ll beat the competition easily.  Camera  As for the camera, there are dual cameras at the back – a 16 MP primary and a 5 MP ultra-wide lens. And because this is a Samsung device, I had quite the expectations from this one.   The images on it are quite good. Everything is good enough – from white balance to dynamic range and color reproduction. They pack a good amount of details, and the sharpness is there. If anything, the images might look ever so slightly washed out in some conditions. Overall, it does a good job under well-lit conditions.      Normal Vs Ultra-wide-angle   1  of 12               Normal Mode         Ultra-wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Ultra-wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Ultra-wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Ultra-wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Ultra-wide-angle Mode         Normal Mode         Normal Mode                                                With the wide-angle lens, you can definitely have a bit of fun! The wide-angle lens on this one is better than we saw on the Galaxy M20, and with it, you can take some stunning pictures. The color accuracy and sharpness does take a hit, but it does serve its purpose.  The portraits, too, are nice! As usual, edge detection can be a bit of hit and miss, but it is more on the accurate side. Sometimes, backgrounds tend to be a bit blown out. Also, you get the option to adjust the blur levels post picture. So, that’s a handy feature.        1  of 4                                                          Low light condition is where it falls short – by a lot. I would say that under low light, it’s basically unusable. The images lack sharpness and details, and everything appears mushy and grainy.  If we talk selfies, generally, they’re great. The amount of details it captures are okay. But the images tend to look cooler. For portraits, it is mostly the same story as the primary camera. The background appears a bit blown out, but the edge detection mostly works.        1  of 5               Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Normal Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Portrait Selfie                           So, I wouldn’t say the cameras are the best in the price category. We do get the ultra-wide lens on this, which we don’t get on others for a similar price. They’re not really “wow”, but they get the job done.  For high-resolution images,  Click here .  Performance  This phone packs the  Exynos 7904 processor , which kinda match the benchmark scores of the Snapdragon 636, or Samsung’s own 7885. But I feel like this is not the processor we should get for the price.  Well, the phone didn’t freeze or stutter anywhere, but everything was a tad bit slower to my liking. For instance, apps take like half a second to launch, and it can be annoying at times. It’s not that frustrating, it’s like something that won’t make that much of a difference but you can’t unsee it.  The performance from this one is also nothing exciting either. Multi-tasking and stuff is okay, and you can game on it pretty well. PUBG runs on medium settings by default, and every other game I tried, like Ocean Horn, Real Racing 3, Asphalt 9, and a bunch of others ran without any problems. The UI, too, is smooth to use.  However, heavy multi-tasking is not something it can handle. For instance, if you get a message on messenger while gaming, then, things start to freeze and it can get pretty frustrating.  Honestly, Samsung could have given it a slightly better SoC, but for the price to package ratio, I also think that would be a bit too much to ask. It is still a good performer, but hard to recommend, if someone’s utmost priority is performance.

The UI is pretty standard and offers a lot of customizable options. There are a few Microsoft bloatware apps, which cannot be removed, but only disabled. But the Samsung bloatware apps like Samsung notes and such can be completely uninstalled.   The UI is pretty lightweight and feels modern. Enabling gesture mode helps in one-handed usage. There’s also a “Reduce Animation” option, which can minimize the animations on your phone’s certain operation, without turning the Developer’s Mode on. And that can help your phone get a tad bit faster.        1  of 2               Night mode on         Night mode off                  I really like this UI from Samsung. It did address what we had been complaining about from a while ago.  Security Features & Extras  To me, it appeared as if the fingerprint sensor was not responsive enough. Maybe it’s the screen unlock animation, but it feels a bit slow compared to the ones on other phones. The Face Unlock is also not as fast. And while these features are showing up on a lot of phones, even on budget ones, Samsung has yet to improve on them. So, this was a bit of disappointment for me.  Battery  In terms of battery, you get a good-sized 4000 mAh unit, and so, the battery life does not disappoint. I usually got over 6 hours’ battery life on heavy usage, and that’s impressive. It’s pretty difficult to use up the battery in a single day. But you will need to charge it by the end of the day, though.   There is the always-on display option, and if you keep that on, it can eat up like 1% of your battery every half-hour or so. But, since there is no LED notification, that thing will have to stay on, even if it means sacrificing your battery. You also get a 15W Adaptive Fast charging, which can take your phone from 0 to 100 in slightly under 2 hours.  Conclusion  So for the price of Rs.28490 or some $250 dollars, the A30 offers you a great design, a great display, excellent battery life, decent cameras, and a user friendly UI. What it lacks in is the performance department, and that’s where the other phones like Redmi Note 7 and Realme 2 Pro excels at. Those phone has also got slightly better cameras, except the ultra-wide-angle feature.  Pros and Cons  Pros:   Great battery life  Good camera  Great display  Good design  Easy and friendly UI   Cons:   Slow performance  Face unlock slower than the competitors  Slow fingerprint']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/samsung-galaxy-a30-review.jpg']
['Huawei P30 Pro and P30 launched – a star is born!'],['Huawei'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['March 27, 2019']",2019-03-27 07:15:00+00:00,"['When it comes to flagship phones, companies try their best to out-do each other. And that kinda works in our favor. It’s us who get to see those cool pieces of technology, and with the latest devices announced from Huawei, it’s nothing short of “Wow”! The company announced two phones: the P30 Pro and the P30 at an event in Paris, successors to last year’s game-changing camera phones, the  P20 Pro  and the P20. With them billing them as #ReWriteTheRules, let’s see what these have to offer.  Huawei P30 Pro Overview  Since the ‘P’ in Huawei’s P-series stand for photography, it’s the cameras that see the most improvement. With a quad-camera setup at the back, that too, of Leica lens, Huawei’s flagships have been dominating the camera sector. In addition, with a DxOMark score of 112, I’m sure it checks all the right boxes.  The quad camera setup consists of a  SuperSpectrum 40 MP wide-angle primary camera  with f/1.6 aperture. Well, a 40 MP camera is no news in today’s times. But the special thing about this is that instead of your regular RGB Bayer-filter that is used in all other smartphone cameras, this one uses an  RYB filter . Meaning that it swaps the green pixels for yellow, and yellow being the brightest of colors, it lets in  40% more light  into the sensors. And that makes for great some great low-light shots! Aptly named, Super spectrum!        Credit: The Verge  As for other cameras, you get a  20 MP ultra-wide angle lens , and this is the only thing that remains similar to last year’s  Mate 20 Pro . You can capture all that you want in it, with that 120-degree field of view, or get some close macro-shots. The other lens is an  8 MP Periscope lens  – meaning that it’s essentially a periscope (a more complex form of what you might have seen in your science labs as students). That lets you get up to  5X Optical Zoom . And if you want more, you can get up to  50X Digital Zoom ! Sure, the quality takes a hit, but with this, you don’t need any binoculars! The final one is not exactly a camera sensor per se, but a  TOF (Time-Of-Flight)  lens. This one resolves the distance between the subject and background, for better portrait shots. Also, it possesses  AR capabilities  as well. However, we’ll have to wait for its full functionality to come around.  Credit: Android Central  Besides the cameras, the Huawei P30 Pro has not changed much. You have a glass design sandwiched in an aluminum frame. You have a tiny water-drop notch up front on the  6.47″ Full HD+ OLED display , housing a  32 MP selfie camera . It seems they won’t be going QHD anytime soon, like the Samsung flagships. With the notch-size gone down, you don’t have an IR sensor for Facial Recognition now. But it does pack an Optical In-display fingerprint scanner.  Under the hood, their’s the  Kirin 980  chip at the helm and an  8 GB of RAM . Internal storage starts at  128 GB  and goes up to  512 GB . In addition, it’s expandable but uses Huawei’s proprietary nano-memory, which is kinda scarce. There’s a large  4200 mAh  battery, with the  40W SuperCharge , along with its Reverse Wireless charging. The phone is also fully IP68 rated for Water and Dust resistance.  This phone comes in five different colors: Breathing Crystal, Amber Sunrise, Pearl White, Aurora and Black. Pricing starts at a  €1000 for the base 128 GB variant , €1100 for the 256 GB and moves up to €1250 for the top 512 GB model!  P30 Pro Specifications:   Design : Glass body front and back, aluminum frame  Display : 6.47″ OLED display with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2340 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Leica Quad-camera setup, 40 MP SuperSpectrum sensor with f/1.6 aperture (RYYB filter) + 20 MP Ultra-wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture + 8 MP Periscope telephoto lens with f/3.4 aperture & 5 X Optical Zoom (50X Digital Zoom) + TOF (Time-Of-Flight) sensor  Front Camera : 32 MP camera with f/2.0 aperture  Processor : Octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset  GPU : Mali-G76 MP10  RAM : 8 GB  Storage : 128 / 256 / 512 GB, expandable via Nano memory up to 512 GB)  OS : Android Pie with EMUI 9.1 on top  Battery : 4200 mAh, 40-W SuperCharge, Reverse Wireless Charging  Sensors : Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, color spectrum  Colors : Aurora, Amber Sunrise, Breathing Crystal, Black, Pearl White  Price : €999 (128 GB) / €1099 (256 GB) / €1249 (512 GB)  Huawei P30 Pro Price in Nepal:  Rs. 1,19,900 (256GB)   Huawei P30 Overview  The Huawei P30 is generally, a toned down, less expensive model of the P30 Pro. Flagships have been doing this for quite a while now. This is the successor to the Huawei P20. With a few cutbacks on the specs, it cutbacks a few 100 Euros in the price as well.  Credit: Expert Reviews  First off, there are only  3 cameras  on the P30, not four. The term ‘only’ may be an understatement, but well, there is one camera, less, on the P30. You get the same  40 MP SuperSpectrum  as the primary lens, but a slightly toned down  16 MP ultra-wide sensor . The  8 MP telephoto  is also not your Periscope camera, so, it offers only a  3X optical zoom . Digital zoom, too, won’t go as far as 50X for sure. But the selfie camera is the same  32 MP lens . What it loses, is the TOF sensor, but its other lenses get the job done while capturing portraits. So, it is not much of a loss.  On the aesthetics side, most of it still remains the same as well. Unlike on the Mate 20 Pro and the Mate 20, both these phones have an in-display fingerprint scanner, albeit Optical ones. The P30 is slightly smaller, with  6.1″ OLED display  and the same water-drop notch cutout.  Inside,  Kirin 980  powers the phone with up to  8 GB RAM  as well.

We saw Apple announcing  iPads ,  iMacs , and  AirPods 2  in very quick succession. Well, that announcement has not passed even a week and Apple yet again organized an event. Dubbed as “It’s Show Time”, the event showcased a ton of products, which the tech giant promises to release for sale this fall.  Apple Card  Apple Card is the Apple-branded credit card for the iPhones. It is primarily a digital wallet that dwells on your iPhones. A physical Titanium card can also be accessed as a backup if needed. Being a digital wallet, the service generally is a platform for digital payment.         Being a digital form of credit card, the Apple card can also be used for making payments. And unlike the predominant digital wallets, which provides points as the reward, Apple is offering cash back on every purchase through the card. Users can get 2% cash back while making a payment through Apple Card online. The rebate increases to 3% while purchasing from Apple itself. But while making the payment through Titanium card, users will only get 1% of cash back. Apple is initially targeting the service to the US, which may be available in various other regions outside the US if Apple succeeds.  Apple TV Plus  Apple TV+ is a subscription-based video-streaming service with features more or less similar to Netflix. The service can be accessed through both offline and online means. And Apple has promised that it will not show any types of Ads while viewing the contents. Users can watch the content via Apple TV App, which is designed for iOS, Mac, Rocu, Fire TV, and Televisions from different manufacturers including  Samsung .   Just like Netflix, Apple is also said to be working on its original shows. And the company is said to spill around $2 billion for the project. Apart from Apple Originals shows, users can pay and watch contents from HBO, Showtime, Starz, CBS All Access, and other services directly through the TV app.  Although this service sounds fascinating, Apple has not named the pricing for the Apple TV Plus yet. The service is slated to debut in fall and maybe the price will be divulged then.  Apple News Plus  As the name implies, this is a new Apple service with which, users can read and browse news from various newspapers and magazines. Apple says that it is in the favor of quality journalism and with this service it aspects to bridge the users and news more conveniently. However, Apple News+ is a subscription-based service. So you will have to subscribe to their monthly packages to be able to read their news feed.   The Cupertino-based company announced that users can read news and articles from over 300 popular magazines, leading newspapers conveniently after subscribing to the monthly plan. However, the service is confined to only the users in the US and Canada.  Interested ones can subscribe to the service if they have iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch models running on iOS 12.2 and Macs running macOS Mojave 10.14.4. The service will demand a price of $9.99 per month for the people residing in the US and $12.99 per month for the people in Canada. Till the date, there is no mention of the yearly subscription plans.  iOS 12.2  iOS 12.2 is the new software update for the iPhones and iPads. This new update primarily embraces the Apple News Plus service and four new Animojis. In new update also fixes the FaceTime glitch, which has been in the news for quite a while now. Apart from that, you can now ask Siri to play videos from your iPad and iPhone to an Apple TV.  Apple Arcade  Apple Arcade is a subscribe-based gaming service, which provides unlimited access to the games. Unlike  Google’s Stadia , Arcade is not a cloud-based gaming platform. It is just a subscription-based game service for the games that are installable from the App Store.  In the event, Apple promised that there will be 100 new and exclusive games on the Arcade when it makes an official debut. And all these games will be playable in iPhones, iPads, Mac, and Apple TV. Games can be conveniently downloaded from the App Store. The subscribers can also try whatever games they like and whenever they like to play. They can also resume the games in other connected devices conveniently. And users can enjoy these games without having to watch any sorts. Apple was very specific that there won’t be any sorts of ads.   The price for the monthly and yearly plans of the subscription has not yet been mentioned. Nonetheless, it will launch this fall and we can easily find out after that. When it launches, it will be available in 150 countries.

['Samsung Galaxy S10+ vs Huawei Mate 20 Pro Camera Comparison: The Battle of the DxOMark Kings'],['Reviews'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['March 26, 2019']",2019-03-26 11:20:56+00:00,"['DxOMark , a camera review site, has scored the  Samsung Galaxy S10+  and the  Huawei Mate 20 Pro  the highest among all the smartphones. Even the rear camera count on both smartphones are the same. There are triple cameras on the back with all three lenses serving the same purpose. So, with the same score of 109, I kept on wondering the better of the two. So, I went to a few places to check out the camera qualities of the phones. And this is what I found.  Day Light Images  Let’s talk about the day time image samples first. This is where all phones are expected to shine, and the Galaxy S10+ and the Mate 20 Pro did do the same.  Color Tone  Color tone is all about a user’s personal preference. Some like colder tone while others are into warmer tint. I am, however, into the natural color tone and that’s what the Galaxy S10+ gave me. If you check out the sample from the S10+ and compare it against the Mate 20 Pro, the latter has a slightly warmer tone to it.              1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Color Tone         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Color tone                  Details  The details are one of the most important aspects of images. And if you compare the two phones against one another, you will notice how the lines and borders on pictures are darker, and this prevails on all the pictures. This is the first thing I saw when I clicked a picture from the Mate 20 Pro. Now, in terms of details, the battle here is edge to edge as I really had a hard time figuring out the winner. But personally, for me, the Galaxy S10+ has better details, albeit, by the slightest of the margins, it is really not that much.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Details 1         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Details 1                  Saturation  I have reviewed a few smartphones from Huawei over the last few months. And one of the major things I noticed on the image samples from all those devices is how they reproduce colors. Huawei tries to make colors pop out on its smartphones’ images, and they are slightly darkened for the purpose. And you will notice the same on the Mate 20 Pro. But even with that, during the day time, the saturation looks better on the same device. The Galaxy S10+ is not behind, but for me and to the plain eye, saturation is better on the Mate 20 Pro.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Saturation         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Saturation                  Dynamic Range  Dynamic range is where I had a hard time again to choose the winner. Checking out the shadow details of the pictures, the colors are reproduced better on the Mate 20 Pro. In some of the images, the Galaxy S10+ had better shadow details. However, the highlight detail is sharp on the Mate 20 Pro, although by a little bit. So, overall, the dynamic range is better on the same device. And like I mentioned before, there isn’t a lot of difference here.        1  of 4               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Dynamic Range 1         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Dynamic Range 1         Huawei Mate 20 Pro Dynamic Range 2         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Dynamic Range 2                        Wide-angle  Both the smartphones have lenses to shoot wide-angle shots. The Galaxy S10+ captures pictures with a wider field-of-view (0.5x) than the Mate 20 Pro (0.6x) although it’s not that different. Even with the wider view, the Galaxy S10+ has better colors, better details, and better saturation than its competition.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro wide-angle         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Wide-angle                  Portrait  Even with three cameras on the back, both the Galaxy S10+ and the Mate 20 Pro lack a depth sensing lens. And I think that’s okay. We are at a time when even software can blur out the background of our subjects effectively, and the same scenario is seen in the portraits. Both these phones are great if the portraits are concerned. Now there were times when both the phones found it hard to blur out the background 100 percent, but they perform well, nonetheless. One thing you will notice on the image is how Huawei’s colors pop out on the background, and how it darkens some parts of the image yet again. But overall, the Mate 20 Pro is a little better on the portrait front.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Portrait         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Portrait                  Night Image Samples  Being flagship devices, anyone expects the Samsung Galaxy S10+ and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro to do well during night time. They come with a hefty price tag and a camera setup no other devices have. The phones have the widest of apertures and have the hardware to match them. So, it was really interesting to pit the devices against one another.  Noise, Details & Exposure  The first thing I noticed about the image samples from the Mate 20 Pro was how it overexposed everything. Take a look at the image above, comparing the sample from where I stood, the Galaxy S10+ had a more natural look to it. The environment was a little dark, and it only brightened up the image slightly. The Mate 20 Pro, on the other hand, exposed it and has over-sharpened it everywhere. It is, however, due to the over-sharpening, why the details look better on the phone.  There is no noise on the pictures as you would expect from a flagship phone. However, the darkest part on some of the images from both phones has a little bit of grains, which is also to be expected.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Night details         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Night details                  Saturation  And just like on the samples from the day time, the colors of the photos I took during night time were also darker than normal on the Mate 20 Pro. The saturation, however, is better on the images from the Galaxy S10+, but to the naked eye, there is no difference at all.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Night saturation         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Night saturation                  Color Tone  In terms of color tone, both the Mate 20 Pro and the Galaxy S10+ have natural one with no hint of any tint whatsoever. So, while the Mate 20 Pro gave off warmer tone during the day time, that was redone during night time.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Night Color Tone         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Night Color Tone                  Selfie Image Samples  Normal Selfie  The easier thing I had to do in this comparison is to pick the winner in terms of selfies. The Samsung Galaxy S10+ is better than the Mate 20 Pro by a margin. Colors, details, clarity, and sharpness is reproduced well by the former which is why it takes this crown.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Normal Selfie         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Normal Selfie                  Portrait Selfie  The Samsung Galaxy S10+ has an additional selfie camera that acts as a depth sensor. So, the background blur is done correctly by the phone with the extra lens. And just like the normal selfie, everything looks better on the Galaxy S10+. Plus outdoors, the Mate 20 Pro blows out the background completely.        1  of 2               Huawei Mate 20 Pro Portrait Selfie         Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Portrait Selfie                  Conclusion  I was really excited to go on photo walks to compare the cameras of the best Android smartphones available in Nepal. And I have to say, I am really impressed with how cameras have evolved on phones. The triple cameras on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S10+ are of great quality and they have really set a high standard when it comes to smartphone photography. The results these cameras have produced define their pricing.  Overall, there were some areas where the Mate 20 Pro won, and there were times where the Galaxy S10+ outshone the former. However, the fact that the Galaxy S10+ betters the Mate 20 Pro in terms of selfies, and even in the videos, makes the Galaxy S10+ the winner. The Mate 20 Pro is not that far behind, and also it is an older model. So, with the launch of the  Huawei P30 , we could actually see an even better camera setup that could have better cameras than the Galaxy S10+. We will be comparing them once we get out hands on the P30, of course.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-vs-huawei-mate-20-pro-camera-comparison.jpg']

This time, the e-commerce giant is offering discounts on various Samsung smartphones.  Samsung Galaxy A50  If somebody asks me, which smartphone to buy at a price under Rs. 35,000, I would definitely recommend the  Galaxy A50 . The phone comes with a triple camera setup at the back and in-display fingerprint scanner. It is also the least expensive smartphone to come with these features.         The Galaxy A50 also flaunts a sizable 4000mAh battery and a big 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display. The display on this device comes with a minuscule notch on the top. On the performance side, the phone features Exynos 9610 chip with 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard memory. And this hardware setup looks plausible especially while considering the price.   The device was priced at RS. 33,490, during its launch. The smartphone is also available at the same price in the retail store. However, in Daraz, you can get the handset for just Rs. 32,200.

The display on the device flaunts Super AMOLED panel due to which the contents pop with true to life colors.   Apart from that, the phone comes with Exynos 7904 chipset on the performance front. The phone also gets 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard memory. Since the Exynos 7904 is said to be comparable with the Snapdragon 636, we can expect its performance to be on par with a slightly expensive  Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro .  On the optics front, the Galaxy A30 enjoys a dual camera setup. The 16MP main camera is accompanied by a 5MP ultra-wide-angle camera. With this camera setup, the Galaxy A30 is slightly more versatile than its competitors are. The Galaxy A30 also comes with a massive 4000mAh battery to keep the device running.   As far as the price of the device is concerned, the Galaxy A30 was initially available for Rs. 28,490. Cutting the price, Daraz is selling the device for just Rs. 27,400.

The phone features 3D Glasstic back, which we already saw on the Galaxy A30 and A50. So the look and feel may be the same here. The Glasstic back also comes with a rainbow-like sheen.   Since Samsung said it’s bringing phones targeting at the millennials, it has enriched the phone with plenty of power to please them. Despite having a svelte design, the phone houses a massive 4500mAh battery. The capacity of which matches only with the most premium Samsung smartphone, the  Galaxy S10 5G . Not just a big battery, Samsung has also included 25-watt fast charging support. Since the flagship  Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus  only come with a 15-watt charger, the inclusion of a faster charging in a midrange phone is duly remarkable.  On the performance side of things, Samsung has still kept a few secrets. Although the tech giant divulged that the phone will come with an octa-core processor and even the CPU Core setup (Dual 2.0GHz + Hexa 1.7GHz), it hasn’t mentioned the name of the chipset. But looking at the CPU Core Setup, we can assume it to be the Snapdragon 675. Alongside the processor, the performance will be aided by either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. In terms of internal memory, the phone is enriched with 128GB of onboard storage, which can be further expanded via a dedicated SD card slot.   On the camera front, Samsung Galaxy A70 flaunts a triple rear camera. The setup comprises of a 32MP main shooter, which comes along with an 8MP ultra-wide-angle shooter and a 5MP depth sensor. On the front, a 32MP selfie shooter resides on the tiny U shaped notch.

And in this short one year of time, the game became a huge hit. The game was download by over 100 million people in the Play Store alone. So needless to say that it was one of the most popular mobile games in 2018. And the crazy does not seem to be dropping even in 2019. Understanding the craze, PUBG announced the PUBG MOBILE Club Open 2019. This is an offline/online tournament, which happens on a global scale where the winner can get the prize of $2.5 million. In order to empower the gamers, Vivo decided to play a part by collaborating with Tencent Games and PUBG Corporation to be the Title Sponsor of this grand gaming tournament.   PUBG MOBILE Club Open 2019  The Club Open 2019 is a year-long event, where both the pro and semi-pro teams can participate and win. The prize pool for the event is $2.5-million. This tournament is divided into Spring Split and Fall Split. Winners of each split will be rewarded with separate prize pool and will face each other in the global finals. The grand final for the Spring Split is scheduled for July. And registration and qualification process for the Fall Split is said to start from August. As far as the grand final of the Fall Split is concerned, it will happen in December of 2019.         This is not the first time Tencent Games has organized such an event. Last year, it hosted PUBG MOBILE Star Challenge 2018, which was a huge success. Tencent flaunted that the grand final of the event was spectated by over 230 million viewers online. Tencent also claimed that there were over 5,000 attendees, who watched the finals live in Dubai. In the last year’s event, a Thailand-based RRQ Anthena Team lifted the trophy.  Vivo’s Role in the Tournament  Lately, Vivo has been sponsoring a lot of sports events. Vivo has been sponsoring the Indian Premier League (IPL) for quite a while now. The Chinese smartphone maker had also been the title sponsor of World Cup 2018. Since Vivo likes so much in participating in the sports events, Vivo couldn’t resist itself being a part of PUBG Mobile Club Open 2019.  We have been seeing a lot of innovations from Vivo lately. Pop-up selfie camera on the  Vivo Nex  and an in-display fingerprint scanner on the  Vivo X21 UD  are some of the examples. Dubbed as  IQOO , Vivo also launched a gaming phone recently. So Vivo is definitely stepping ahead to bring gaming-centric handsets.  Vivo says that being official smartphone partner of the event, Vivo would like to show its commitment to connect with gamers around the globe. As a Title Sponsor, the Chinese smartphone maker would also like to aware people about the gaming prowess of the Vivo phones. And if the gamers find any issues with the device while playing on the tournament, Vivo probably would focus on those aspects on its upcoming phones. So the event not just looks encouraging for the gamers but also could open the new doors for the upcoming gaming phones.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vivo-pubg-mobile-club-open-2019.jpg']

From  sleep improvement  to  earphones that monitor your health  and stuff, they’re doing a lot of things. I guess the next compelling thing for people to spend money on, is their health. And introducing a ton of health features on their products will get people to buy them. So, what we have today is not a product in itself, but a part of it.  The giant firm applied for the patent and it has also been granted. It is a small product that can be embedded in Apple devices. The sensor can  warn you of high levels of pollution, toxic gas  and alcohol in your breath. This sensor is easily embeddable in watch straps and future iPhones or iPads. The material has multiple sensors to detect everything from dangerous  carbon mono-oxide levels  to pollution to ‘vaporous gas’. And it can also detect the alcohol in your breath. So, maybe it can tell you if you can drive or not after a party!  Credit:  Patently Apple  According to  Patently Apple , it is the fifth of such devices, i.e. ‘electronic devices with environmental sensors’ from the company. The patents describes the device as a gas sensor attached to the printed circuit which is configured to measure the concentration of a gas. The gas to be measured is among a group of selected gases: carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, alcohol vapor, propane, ozone, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, benzene, methane, hydrogen, and oxygen.        The device can be used in small and portable devices like phones, watches, and media devices. It can also be embedded in laptops and such.  With all these activities, the company seems its doubling down on its health care features. It wants others to see Apple as not only premium phones or such, but also as health and fitness devices. There are various instances of this as well. A study found that  Apple Watches could add 2 years to your life  via physical exercises, while there was also a  piece of news about it saving a life !  So, will these efforts from Apple pay off?

Illegal import of smartphones is a problem that is rampant at present in the country. Even the  mobile distributors of the country are worried due to this problem . But now, the government is implementing a new strategy to minimize and hopefully eradicate the practice.  The plan is yet to be put into place. But it is clear that we’ll see ADMS being implemented for mobile phones for this.  ADMS (Advanced Distribution Management System)  will allow the government or authorized bodies to actively monitor the imported phones inside the country. And, as they register in the networks, they can find out if the phones are obtained illegally or not.  The government has allocated a budget of  Rs. 1 crore 30 lakhs  for this project. And it has called bids from those interested to regulate the ADMS process in Nepal. Currently, there are six companies that have submitted their biddings. And out of them, the one which stands out after evaluation and analysis of their proposal will be selected by the government. These companies will be evaluated on  80% technical feasibility and 20% economic feasibility  of their proposals.        Right now, the companies currently in bidding are  Mobilian Trade International Pvt. Ltd. (Nepal), Infra-Data N.V. (Belgium), Green I.T. Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (Nepal), New- mera  (M) ADN BHD (Malaysia), OSI Consulting Pvt. Ltd. (India)  and  Namaste Global Comm Pvt. Ltd. (Singapore) .\xa0The government had requested for proposals for the design, development, testing, implementation, and management from various companies some 11 months back. They received 13 proposals, out of which, six of them were short-listed.  NTA (Nepal Telecommunications Authority) claims that the evaluation is concluding. And that, a firm will soon be selected. After that, there will be various agreements and contracts within a month. After which, the firm will be given 6 months to put everything in place. So, the system will be functional by the coming  Bhadra, 2076 .  After the implementation of ADMS, illegally imported or smuggled devices will cease working in the country. But those devices that are already here before the process will continue working. The rule will apply to the upcoming illegal phones. So, no doubt, that this will help minimize the illegal importing of phones in the country.  What do you think of this new strategy? Will it work? Or do you think the government will not be able to pull it off?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nta-blocking-illegal-phones.jpg']

So, for this year, at the GDC 2019, Intel just confirmed the existence of it’s 9th Gen H processors.   Intel confirms the mobile CPUs are in their schedule, all set to launch this summer. It remains to be seen if Intel follows their own previous strategy; increase the core count and GHz while leaving the TPD. A pretty successful turnout for Intel and its mobile chip making business. As vague was their launch date, so was the details about those chips. There are a few details available on them, one of which was their first OEM partner, Lenovo.

But sadly, playing such games requires a power PC or a good gaming console. Wouldn’t it be great if playing high-end games were as smooth as watching video contents on YouTube? Well, Google finally seems to hear the prayers of all the gamers. It launched a new gaming platform called “Stadia” (plural of Stadium). Google promises that, with this gaming platform, playing games would be as easy as streaming videos online. Furthermore, no powerful hardware would be required.  The project sounds ambitious but it looked ravishing when Google showcased the platform in GDC (Google Developer Conference). In the conference, a volunteer showed Assassin’s Creed Odyssey playing it on multiple devices. And the surprising thing about that is the game ran on a low-end gaming PC,  Google Pixel 3 smartphone , a tablet, and television without a fuss. And what was even more exciting was the game streamed at 4K resolution and 60fps without a sign of stutter.         Stadia: A gaming platform  Google says the primary motive of the platform is to free the gamers from the hardware limitations of the gaming devices. And while playing the games in the platform, a user does not necessarily require powerful gaming hardware. That’s because the game does not run the device being used by a gamer, it will run on Google’s global network of data centers instead. Since Google’s data centers have a lot of computing power at its disposal, even the heaviest of the games will also run very smoothly. This also gives the developers an opportunity to build graphics-intensive games since there will be no computational limitations.  “When Stadia launches later this year, we expect to be able to deliver 4K 60 fps at approximately the same bandwidth requirements.”  Although Google said any controller at the users’ disposal can be used to control the games, Google also announced a gaming controller on its own. The Stadia Controller comes with an in-built microphone, a dedicated Screenshot button, and a Google Assistant button. It also has two joysticks, four action buttons, a full-size directional pad, and two shoulder buttons on either side.  Google announced to deliver gaming at 4K resolution and 60fps and to further go with 8K resolution in the future. That looks appealing but Google also described that the possible resolution and frame rate output to differ according to the internet connection of the user. Also, there is internet latency to consider. So although the concept looks tantalizing, we are not yet sure how the platform will be like when it comes to life.

The iPhone maker firstly announced the  new iPad Mini and iPad Air . And there was the launch of the  new iMacs  the other day. Continuing the streak, Apple then launched its beloved wireless earbuds, the AirPods. The newly announced Apple AirPods 2 features a new chipset, comes with a wireless charging case, a bigger battery, and Hands-free ‘Hey Siri’ support.  Firstly, let’s start the things with the chip. The earphone comes with Apple’s new H1 headphone chip. Apple claims that with this new chip on the board, the new AirPods will have a faster and more stable wireless connection than the previous generation. iPhone maker further claimed that the performance here will be 2x faster while switching between the active device (e.g. switching between an iPhone and a MacBook). With a new chip on the board, the device is also said to offer better battery backup. Apple wasn’t specific about the capacity of the battery though. But it said that the new AirPods will offer 50% more talk time than the previous generation. Needless to mention, the wireless connectivity has improved here with the inclusion of Bluetooth 5.0 support (earlier model had Bluetooth 4.0).         Design-wise, the new Apple AirPods 2 is the reminiscence of the first generation of AirPods. However, Apple gave a subtle touch by adding a small LED indicator light on the outside. It will now be easier to readily know about the battery life of the device.  But that’s just a small of the story. The big thing here lies on its charging case. This time, AirPods come with a wirelessly charging case, which is said to be Qi standard. We have already seen a similar move from Samsung on the newly announced Galaxy Airbuds. So it didn’t look quite innovative. Nonetheless, the feature is praiseworthy. Although there is no official information yet, the Apple AirPods 2 wireless charging case is rumored to get fully charged just in 15 minutes.  The earbuds also come with hands-free Siri Voice Control feature. On the previous model, users had to double-tap to summon the voice assistant. “Hey, Siri” command can also be used to change the audio volumes, change audio tracks, and make a call easily.   As far as the price is concerned, the new AirPods 2 costs $159 for the one with a regular charging case. The pricing remains unchanged than original AirPods. The AirPods 2 with wireless charging case, however, is slightly pricier. It demands a price of $199 on the purchase. The wireless charging case can also be used to charge the original AirPods and the interested ones can buy them separately at $79.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/apple-airpods-2.jpg']
['Vivo X27 Unveiled with FunTouch 9 based on Anrdoid 9'],['Vivo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['March 21, 2019']",2019-03-21 08:52:04+00:00,"['While Vivo’s smartphone lineup may not be as confusing as some others (Xiaomi’s for instance), they do have a lot of phones. Vivo’s V-series are the mid-rangers right now, and I guess, the X-series are the flagships, or is it the Nex? See? It’s confusing. Anyway, Vivo recently launched the  V15  and  V15 Pro . And now, they already unveiled a new phone –  Vivo X27 . This has slight improvements over the V15 Pro, with quite the price.  Vivo X27 Overview  The Vivo X27, more or less, looks like the V15 Pro. Even the sizes and colors are similar. The X27 is also available in the two-tone gradient coloring, so, if you put them side by side, maybe you won’t be able to tell one from the other. Also, it has the same  6.39″ AMOLED display \xa0and no notches or bezels up front. So, yes, it seems Vivo will push their pop-up camera in most of its smartphones. The  in-display fingerprint sensor  is also there, and the back houses the triple camera setup in a similar layout.  Source: GSMArena  In terms of the camera setup, both have the  primary 48 MP camera  with Quad-Bayer filter. So, you’ll get images of 12 MP by default via  pixel binning . The improvement is on the Ultra-wide lens, as the X27 features a  13 MP 120-degree lens  over 8 MP of the V15 Pro. The depth sensor stays the same at  5 MP . However, the selfie camera is a downgrade. While the V15 Pro packs a 32 MP selfie camera (with Quad-Bayer filter), the X27 has a  16 MP selfie shooter . But we should be able to get better image resolution on this one. Also, the motorized pop-up is a tad bit slower on the X27 at 0.68 seconds compared to 0.46 seconds of the V15 Pro.        In terms of power, the X27 runs on the  Snapdragon 710  and  8 GB RAM . While the RAM is the same (for 8 GB variant of V15 Pro), the processor, to me, seems a bit doubtful. I mean, the Snapdragon 675 on the V15 Pro has a faster CPU, but a slower GPU than the 710. So, we can’t say which wins in overall performance. In terms of storage, however, the X27 packs a whopping  256 GB , by default. Also, there is a microSD card slot. And in terms of battery, the X27 has a  4000 mAh  over 3700 of the V15 Pro.  However, the price of the X27 makes me think hard that the V15 Pro is a better value for money, here. Because while you get the V15 Pro for $345, the  X27 sells for $535 ! Anyone can plainly see why V15 Pro is a better buy.  Funtouch OS 9  The hardware differences aren’t all that we get on the X27. It does come with  FunTouch OS 9  out of the box. FunTouch 9 runs on  Android 9 Pie , and while the V15 Pro runs on that too, there are apparently new features, or else why would they unveil that OS again?  So, apparently, the OS now comes with  72 new features ,  55 new optimizations ,  263 UI improvements  as well as a simpler and more beautiful interface. It will also make for a more friendlier and smarter User experience – according to Vivo. But deep down, we all know, that we’d like to not see the iPhone – clone UI.  FunTouch 9 claims to have soft and restrained colors, as well as rich details. It also enables you to change themes, icon layouts, add rounded corners, and dark patterns. In addition, you also get some built-in semi-abstract wallpapers. So, now, you can be sure to see this OS in all upcoming Vivo smartphones.

But that the only thing Apple launched this week. Apple refreshed its iMac lineup as well. And the new Apple iMac 2019 comes with seriously powerful upgrades over its previous models.  Although the new iMacs may look similar to the previous models on the outside, but on the inside, it is a different story. Apple refreshed both of its 4K and 5K iMac models with new notable processors and the graphics cards making it an amazing performer.  Apple iMac 2019 (4K 21.5-inch Model)  Talking about the smaller iMac (21.5-inch iMac) model, it comes in two CPU configurations. One with an 8 th  generation Quad-core Core i3 processor clocked at 3.6GHZ and another with an 8 th  generation Hexa-core Core i5 processor with a clock speed of 3.0GHz. But both of these variants are configurable with an optional 8 th  gen Hexa-core Core i7 processor, which runs at 3.2GHz clock speed.        On the graphics front, the 4K model comes in three different variants. The base variant receives the Radeon Pro 555X graphics card with 2GB of GDDR5 video memory. Similarly, the higher end model gets the Radeon Pro 560X with 4GB GDRR5 memory. The higher-end variant also has an extra privilege on its sleeve. It can be reconfigured with a more capable Radeon Pro Vega 20 with 4GB of HBM2 memory.   Apple iMac 2019 (5K 27-inch Model)  As far as the 5K 27-inch model of the iMac is concerned, the device comes with three variants in terms of CPU. The base variant comes with the 8 th  gen Intel Core i5 Hexa-core CPU clocked at 3.0GHz. The mid-tier of the bunch gets the 8 th  gen Intel Core i5 Hexa-core CPU running at a clock speed of 3.1GHz. The higher-end model, the powerful of the bunch enjoys a 9 th  Gen Intel Core i5 with six cores on the inside clocked at 3.7GHz. If one wishes to make a more capable workstation to handle the workloads, the mid-tier and higher-end model can also be configured with the 9 th  Gen Intel Core i9 processor with eight cores (3.6GHz).  Graphics wise, the base model is equipped with Radeon Pro 57X (with 2GB GDDR5 memory) and mid model with Radeon Pro 575X graphics card (with 4GB GDDR5 video memory). The higher-end model, on the other hand, boasts a powerful Radeon Pro 580X GPU (with 8GB GDDR5 memory). It can also be configured with more capable Radeon Pro Vega 48 (with 8GB HBM2).  Memory & Storage  On the memory side of things, all the five models (three variants of the 5K model and two variants of the 4K model) readily comes with 8GB of DDR4 RAM (2666MHz) on the board. But they can be increased to 16GB or 32GB on any day. However, only the higher-end variant of the 5K model can also be boosted with whopping 64GB of RAM.  On the storage front, the choice of Apple is not particularly pleasing. The base variant of the 4K model gets 1TB of HDD (5400-rpm drive). Other models come with a slightly better Apple’s Fusion Drive, which is nothing but a fancy name for an SSHD. Except for the base variant of the 21.5-inch model and the high-end variant of the 27-inch model, all the newbies come with 1TB of Apple’s Fusion Drive. And in the case of higher end model (5K 27-inch), 2TB of SSHD comes out of the box. SSD configurations are also available but Apple offers them separately.  In terms of price, the 4K 21.5-inch model of the Apple iMac 2019 costs $1299 for the base variant whereas the better one demands $1499. And when it comes to the 5K 27-inch model, it costs $1799, $1999, and $2299 for the base, mid-tier, and higher-end variants respectively.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/apple-imac-2019.jpg']

In an official tweet, the company confirmed that it will launch the new devices on April 10. A video attached to the tweet has three displays, which proves that Samsung is unveiling three phones at the event.  If rumors are to be believed, the  Galaxy A90  will be one of the releases that day. The device is believed to be Samsung’s first smartphone with a pop-up selfie camera. This camera could also have a rotating mechanism like the old Oppo N1. That will complement the triple rear cameras on the back according to speculations.         In previous years, Samsung usually had the  Galaxy A9  as its premium mid-range smartphone. And the new Galaxy A90 is expected to be the same.  Samsung is also expected to launch the  Galaxy A40 and the Galaxy A20  at the event.

For the step, Qualcomm has tried to cut down on the time it takes for a sender’s signal or message to reach the receiver’s device.  And just like the company had promised before, the speed of 5G connectivity has helped a Chinese doctor perform surgery over the network which could have easily passed as a miracle a few years ago.  Also Read:  What is 5G? Why is it important?        The doctor performed brain surgery on a Parkinson’s disease patient who was 1,800 miles away. This was possible through the 5G network as the doctor controlled a robot to implant a ‘pacemaker’ like device into the patient’s brain.  Parkinson’s disease is a disorder where the nerve cells of the brain that produce dopamine are affected. This results in various muscle issues and there isn’t a cure for it. So, what doctors do is insert an implant in brains that help control some of the symptoms of the patients.  The surgery was conducted on Saturday by Dr. Ling Zhipei, a doctor for People’s Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing. From Sanya, an island located on the south coast of China, the doctor controlled the machine and carried out the surgery on the patient who was in Beijing. The operation was carried out in around 3 hours of time.  Talking to the China Global Television Network (CGTN), Dr. Zhipei said, “The 5G network has solved problems like video lag and remote-control delay experienced under the 4G network, ensuring a nearly real-time operation. And you barely feel that the patient is 3,000 kilometers away.”  According to CGTN, the procedure was performed on China Mobile Network with Huawei’s 5G technology.  Experts claim that 5G is a new era in terms of the internet and the devices connected with the internet. And the example that the network has helped control a device thousands of miles away in real time without latency is definitely a great example of how technology has evolved.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/doctor-brain-surgery-5g-network.jpg']

Then again, the A20 adds an AMOLED display to the equation. On the other hand, the M30 poses a bigger threat to the A20. Pricing remains similar for both, but the M30 gets triple camera setup, more battery, and slightly better SoC.

And to lure more people into gaming devices, Xiaomi added a new handset in its gaming series lineup. The Xiaomi Black Shark 2 comes with a ton of improvements over the last year’s model. And the tech bloggers believe that it will set the bar for gaming phones quite high.  Overview:  The Black Shark 2 being a gaming phone, houses top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855 chipset on the board. To enhance the gaming capabilities, the phone features Snapdragon Elite Gaming graphics processing technology. On the memory side of things, the phone comes in 6GB, 8GB, and 12BG of RAM. As far as the internal storage is concerned, Xiaomi has brought 128GB and 256GB variants.  Xiaomi Black Shark 2 also comes with a Liquid Cool 3.0 liquid-cooling technology to dissipate the heat generated in the rigorous gaming sessions. With this technology, Xiaomi promises to lower the temperature of the device by 14-degrees. The handset also comes with a cooling case add-on equipped with a fan. The casing accelerates the cooling process thus lowering the temperature of the device by an extra 5 degrees.         Be it a  gaming laptop  or a gaming phone, manufacturers usually make a compromise on the display. But that’s no longer the case on the Black Shark 2. This gaming phone comes with an AMOLED display, which came from the Samsung itself. Since Samsung’s AMOLED displays usually offer a better color accuracy with punchy colors, the screen on this handset could be really satisfying. Furthermore, Xiaomi has optimized the display decreasing the latency to 43.5ms. That’s really impressive, especially for a touch screen device.  Xiaomi further added a pressure sensitive system on the device. This allows the users to achieve differing on-screen actions depending on the intensity of force applied on the screen. And beneath this screen resides a Samsung-made in-display fingerprint scanner, which works as a biometric authentication tool while unlocking the device.   On the camera front, the device flaunts a 48MP main camera backed by a 12MP telephoto shooter. With the telephoto camera on the board, the phone can capture images with lossless zooming up to 2x. Talking about the selfie shooter, a 20MP camera dwells on the front. Under the hood rests a 4000mAh battery, which also supports 27W fast charging.

It wasn’t exactly a must-have feature, neither did it receive complete positivity from the community. It was certainly something cool, but with very little support from the developers, it is yet to take off. The added cost of RTX GPUs didn’t help either nor will the new news that we have for you today.  Ray Tracing in an AMD card  As you might have already seen, Crytek’s new demo called the “Neon Noir” showcasing the Real-Time Ray Tracing reflections. If you haven’t seen it yet, you can check the video out below. The Neon Noir tech demo, according to Crytek, ran on a Vega 56 graphics card and was “developed on a bespoke version of CRYENGINE 5.5”.         Though the demo was experimental, it ran on an AMD GPU and in 4k no less. There is still a lot we need to discover about it, and it should be a while before we see this implemented in any of the games. But hey, atleast we know we do not need an RTX card for real-time ray tracing right? Seems like Nvidia does too.  Nvidia’s backward compatibility (sort of)  Nvidia just announced their own 10-series chips will get this feature as well. Basically, a driver update will bring the “basic ray tracing”. The update is set to roll out starting next month. The quality or performance won’t be up on par with it’s RTX series. Older (10-series) GPUs weren’t designed to rendering lighting or shadow effects.   Nevertheless, they can still push out just enough to improve the lighting of the environment and characters. Nvidia says “It’s a lot better than not having it” and added, “We’ve been working very hard to optimize ray tracing across all our GPUs”. You can check out a demo that Nvidia showcased above.  Any increase of the graphics is always going to come with a corresponding decrease in performance  Ray Tracing will only be available starting GTX 1060 6GB and will go all the way up to Titan XP which includes the fresh  GTX 1660  and it’s  Ti version . Finally, Nvidia also addressed the sluggish adoption rate of RT supported games, announcing that more than a dozen game developers including Unity and Epic will adopt ray tracing this year.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ray-Tracing-Platform.jpg']

When everyone was thinking that the Redmi sub-brand will focus only on smartphones, it launched “truly wireless” earbuds. Dubbed as Xiaomi Redmi AirDots, the new earbuds is undoubtedly the cheapest TWS earbuds you can buy in Nepal.  Redmi AirDots Overview  The earbuds come in a small form factor and are very light in terms of weight. Each bud merely weighs 4.1 grams. So the weight may not create any tension on the ears even while plugging in the ears for a prolonged period. In its minuscule stature, the Redmi AirDots houses a 7.2mm audio driver and a 40mAh battery on each one.  Xiaomi claims that the earbuds on the full charge will last for around four hours. The earbuds make use of its case while charging. And the case has a 300mAh battery on its own. As far as the charging time is concerned, an earbud takes 1.5 hours to get fully charged whereas the case requires two full hours.         In terms of colors, the Redmi Airdots come only in black attire and costs CNY 99 when it comes to the price. However, it’s a little bit expensive here in Nepal. Despite bringing affordable earbuds, Xiaomi hasn’t been parsimonious on providing the features on the device. The buds make use of Bluetooth 5.0 while connecting with smartphones. The earbuds also have a built-in DSP with “environment noise reduction”. So we can expect the device can fairly segregate the audio from the background noises.

Apple iPad Mini 2019 Overview  The trend of cutting down the bezels in the smartphones has given rise to the bigger displays on them. And that’s been one of the reasons why the demand of tablets is going downhill. So many of us were thinking that Apple could drop its miniature tablet or the iPad Mini.

The display on the handset is also said to be 25 percent brighter than the earlier model.         The new iPad Mini also comes with a stylus, which comes with Apple’s proprietary name, the “Apple Pencil”. The Apple Pencil can come handy for sketching and for jotting down the notes. But unlike the last year’s iPad, the Apple Pencil that works with iPad Mini doesn’t support magnetic charging and pairing.  On the performance side, the phone comes with Apple A12 Bionic chipset, which was also used in the  latest iPhones . On the memory front, the phone gets 2GB RAM with 64GB and 256GB variants in the case of onboard storage.  It has been two years Apple ditched Touch ID feature from its iPhones. The company also stripped the feature on the last year’s iPad Pro providing Face ID feature as the replacement. But in the new iPad Mini, Apple rejuvenated the Touch ID feature.

The base model, or the standard version, obviously isn’t capable of all this, but that starts at  $39,000 .  A brief side note on Tesla’s electric vehicle series: the Model Y completes their promised lineup acronym,  S3XY . The  Model S  and  X , were high-end cars from the company, which was later, joined by the more affordable  Model 3  series, and now there’s the Model Y.  Here’s another fun fact: the Model 3 has now sold almost  150,000 models  since it hit “mass-production”.

Mainstream manufacturers like BMW, Porsche are already working on their own versions of electric SUVs. Even startups like China’s “Bryton” or America’s “Rivian” are joining the market. Rightfully so, SUVs do sell more than cars, and personally, I feel they are more practical too.  This means Tesla isn’t the only player in the electric car market right now. Chances are if you wanna buy an “electric SUV” in the coming years, they aren’t the only brand you would be looking at, as opposed to just a few years ago.

It meticulously shows a  dual camera setup  at the back, and a punch-hole display on the front just like the  Galaxy S10 . Although Google smartphones may not be the best selling handsets in the smartphone box office, they are well-remarked in the tech community. They are also considered the best when it comes to mobile photography prowess. Their prodigy in computational photography has received heaps of praises from everyone. Well why not? When phones were moving to dual and triple cameras, the company was achieving all that result with a single unit! Even on the DxOmark,  Google Pixel 3 and 3XL  have been the best camera smartphones with a single lens.  But the search engine giant seems to be changing its winning formula in its new devices.

A rendered image leaked by the SlashLeaks shows the punched hole on the display embracing two selfie cameras. Gotta keep up with the trends, right?

But on the front, there is very slim bezels when compared with the last year’s devices. Since we didn’t see much design changes in Pixel 3 and 3XL, these changes will definitely be welcoming.  Since these attributes came just from a supposed leak, we will definitely have to wait for the official unveiling of the device to confirm all these features.

['Samsung is working on in-display selfie camera to achieve the ‘perfect full-screen’ display'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 16, 2019']",2019-03-16 12:27:24+00:00,"['A few years back, nobody gave a second thought about the huge bezels surrounding the display on smartphones. But as soon as the concept of bezel-less display came out, the smartphone world is head-over-heels in achieving it. The front camera comes as a barrier to getting rid of the bezels completely. Therefore, different smartphone brands have shown their own form of ingenuity to achieve the highest screen to body ratio. Some smartphone brands went with the notches while others adopted a pop-up camera mechanism. We also saw a slider mechanism while some implemented a secondary display entirely. In that case, some brands did not even hesitate to ditch the front camera entirely. But that hasn’t been very efficient so far. So Samsung, the smartphone giant, is stepping up to develop a technology to incorporate the selfie camera under the display without using a notch or punch holes.  Last October, at a presentation, Samsung said that it’s working on four new types of displays. An Infinity-V, Infinity-O, Infinity-U, and new Infinity display. Among the four, we have already seen three of them. Infinity-V was used on  Samsung Galaxy M10  and  Galaxy M20 .  Galaxy A50  and the  Galaxy A30  made use of the Infinity-U display. Whereas, their flagships come with Infinity-O displays. Commonly known as a hole-punch display, they are one of the awe-inspiring features in the  Samsung Galaxy S10 devices . Although such cutouts are less obtrusive and more user-friendly, it has not been an ideal type of display we have seeking for.  “Though it wouldn’t be possible to make in the next one to two years, the technology can move forward to the point where the camera hole will be invisible, while not affecting the camera’s function in any way,” Yang Byung-Duk, Samsung’s vice president of the mobile communication display R&D group told Korea’s\xa0Yonhap News Agency\xa0on Thursday.        These days, we can see smartphones with a fingerprint sensor embedded inside the display. All the necessary sensors like proximity and ambient light sensor are also embedded inside the screen on a fair number of handsets. Some manufacturers are also using Body SoundCasting Technology to propagate sound through the screen. The selfie shooter is the only thing remaining on the front panel. And what is restraining aspect to achieve the feat. So it will be quite interesting to see how Samsung will bring its new infinity display. Since Yang told, it is impossible to make it in the next one or two years, can we expect the feature could make a debut in…let’s say, the Galaxy S13?  What are your thoughts on it? Do we really need a full-view or infinity or bezel-less display? Are you okay with these water-drop notches? Or are Pop-up cameras and dual-displays the future? Let us know and drop your thoughts down in the comments.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/samsung-in-diplay-selfie-camera.jpg']

Although there are no leaks and rumors or even news about the existence of a Pocophone F2, we might, however, see the Xiaomi Poco F1 Lite making a debut really soon.  Xiaomi Poco F1 Lite Overview  Owing to the report from the SlashLeaks, a couple of listings on the Geekbench website suggested the presence of the Poco F1 Lite. Sometime later, another listing popped out mentioning about the “Xiaomi Uranus”. Xiaomi has two sub-brands (Redmi and Pocophone) and a whole bunch of smartphones in its lineup.

In terms of memory, the phone has a  4 GB of RAM . On the software front, the phone gets the  Android 9.0 Pie  with Xiaomi’s custom skin on the top. The listing also carried March 14 as the upload date. So the phone seems to be in progress as of now. But it may not take long for the device for the official unveiling.         Despite being a 2018 phone, the Pocophone F1 is surely one of the best smartphones at its price even on today’s date. The handset has also received price drops in some countries making it more affordable. And the recent updates have made the device capable of capturing  4K videos at 60 fps  and also the ultra-slow motion videos. Furthermore, the phone also got  Widevine L1 support  making it suitable for watching Netflix and Amazon prime videos at a higher resolution. With these features, the handset looks really compelling.   In addition, Xiaomi has also recently launched  Redmi Note 7 Pro with Snapdragon 675  and  Redmi Note 7 with Snapdragon 660  at a very competitive price. So the launch of another SD 660 handset may create confusion among the consumers. But it all depends upon the pricing at the end. And we are also yet to hear more of the features after all.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/xiaomi-pocophone-f1-review.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy A2 Core with Android Go Leaked Online'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 16, 2019']",2019-03-16 09:18:38+00:00,"['Since the beginning of 2019, Samsung has been really aggressive in the smartphone market. To keep the prices of their devices low, they have changed their strategy entirely. Some say they are heavily inspired with the pricing strategy and the value for money devices like the Xiaomi phones. And that may well be true since we saw quite a battle of Samsung and Xiaomi when it comes to the lower and midrange phones.  In the Q1 of 2019, we saw a number of budget and mid-range phones and they don’t seem to be slowing down even in Q2. We have also seen the leaks and rumors of a fair number of  A-series devices . And this time, one more device has been added to the list. Samsung Galaxy A2 Core is the handset, which recently surfaced online with a model number of SM-A260F. Going by the specs, A2 Core seems to be Samsung’s answer to  Xiaomi’s Redmi Go .  Samsung Galaxy A2 Core Overview  Samsung has already released phones with “Core” moniker like the  Galaxy J2 Core   and  J4 Core . These devices carry the Android Go OS in their systems. And just like those devices, the Galaxy A2 Core will also come with Android Go software. Earlier Geekbench listings had shown the device to be running on Android 8.1 Oreo. But we hope the device will be on Android Pie on the unveiling event. Though, despite being an Android Go phone, the phone may not feature the stock version of the OS. We have already seen Samsung’s touch-ups on the J2 Core and J4 Core. And we can expect the same from the device.        Owing to the allegedly leaked image, the back of the device seems like Glossy Plastic, which we saw on  Galaxy M10  and  Galaxy M20 . But unlike those devices, the Samsung Galaxy A2 Core has a single camera at the back. A flash and a speaker lies well below the rear camera. The image also shows generous bezels on the device with Samsung’s branding on the chin.   Android Go phones are often blemished with low performing hardware, but in the case of Galaxy A2 Core, it seems otherwise. Geekbench listing showed that the phone will be powered with  Exynos 7870  chipset paired with 1 GB RAM. If that’s true, then, it will definitely outperform the Xiaomi’s Redmi Go, which is Xiaomi’s first take on the Android Go ecosystem.  Release Date and Availability  So we are quite eager to see how the device turns out when it finally makes debut. Although we are not yet aware of the launch date of the device, the screen on the rendered image shows the date of  March 22 . So we can expect the device to go official around that date. The phone is expected to launch in India first, followed by its neighboring countries. So we might also see the device making its entrance in Nepal.

['Android 10 Q Beta Released: 10 Things You Need to Know'],['Android'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['March 16, 2019']",2019-03-16 02:19:57+00:00,"['Source: XDADevelopers                  Google has just released the Beta of the new version of Android – Android v10 Q, the successor to the  Android Pie (v9.0) . We are not sure what this variant will be called, but we do know the upgrades Q has brought for the users. So, in this article, I will discuss the 10 new features of the new Android software.  System-wide dark mode  A system-wide dark mode is one of the most asked features on Android. For years now, users have asked Google for the feature, but their hope had always turned into frustration. However, this time though, the Californian company has introduced a system-wide dark theme on Android 10 Q. To enable this feature, you will have to toggle the battery saver mode. This is just the initial beta version, so Google will definitely single out this feature on its software.  Privacy Setting  The Android 10 Q now has a different menu just for Privacy settings. There are various tabs inside the setting which will let users set privacy according to the applications they use.        Updated notification control  Google focuses on making notifications more user-friendly with each software update. And this time, the company has made the notification manager a little different with three options – block, show silently and keep alerting. This will definitely save users from the hassle of going through the settings app just to make a few changes.  Foldable phone support  After the unveiling of the  Samsung Galaxy Fold  and the  Huawei Mate X , it is safe to say that 2019 will be the year of foldable phones. So, to help with this, Google will make the new software optimized for the technology. Now, this might not result on a whole new optimized UI for foldable devices, but Android Q will definitely better the overall foldable experience.  Icon and accent colors  On Android 10 Q, Google has hidden a few tweaks on the Developer Option setting. Users can now change accent colors and the shape of the icons and notification toggle according to the options from Google.  Location and permissions  For years now, Android software has only offered two options when it comes to permission. This time though, Android Q will offer another additional permission that only applies to when the application is running. This will certainly be of help, especially if the location permission is considered as a lot of applications use the location of the device while running on background.  Updated share menu  The share menu on Android has always been one of the slowest aspects of the software. Google seems to have tackled this issue as the share menu loads up a little faster than before. We can certainly expect this to improve even more with the new beta updates.  QR code for Wi-Fi  This feature has been around in Xiaomi’s smartphones for quite a while now. The devices with the feature are able to share Wi-Fi credentials with another smartphone just by scanning a QR code. Google seems to have liked this feature as Android Q lets users create QR codes for Wi-Fi network to share the password.  Faster App Launches  With every new release of Android software, Google has always made app launches and the whole UI a lot faster. This time it’s no different as Android Q lets users run applications’ data earlier for a faster launch.  Better Biometrics  With Android v10 Q, smartphones will now display error messages to users if their smartphone doesn’t have a dedicated face recognition hardware. And like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, this new upgrade will also let users sign into different applications and make purchases.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/android-q-beta-launched.jpg']

This new card is based on Nvidia’s  Turing architecture , which has now entered a new pricing category. The new card is priced at $219 for the base model, setting a new standard (kind of) in that segment. Essentially a cut-down version of the 1660Ti, which was a replacement for the GTX 1060 (6 GB), this one seemingly looks to replace the GTX 1060 (3 GB).

It does lack the RT feature, Tensor Cores and has to make do with GDDR5 memory. That’s 6 GB of GDDR5 memory, with a bandwidth of 192 GB/s. Other specs like its TDP, maximum power consumption, or recommended power system remains similar to its Ti version. Going by the benchmarks and performance results, we could call this a great product by Nvidia.  Read More:  Nvidia GTX 1660Ti goes official        It doesn’t exactly edge out its counterparts completely (but is better than the RX590), but it is the best GPU you can buy for $219. Aimed at 1080p gaming, this GPU should be a perfect fit for current GTX 960 (68% faster) or the GTX 970 (113% faster) owners. Given similar TDP numbers, the upgrade should be seamless. Will this help Nvidia with the backlash it received with the value proposition of RTX cards? Yes, it most certainly will.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Nvidia-GTX-1660.jpg']

And now, they are recalling another  28,500 more . This brings the total recalled batteries to 78,500. Also, this makes it the third time HP issued a battery warning in the last four years.  HP says that the batteries are flawed in the sense they could catch fire. Apparently, they found out that their Lithium-ion batteries were prone to overheating and catching fire. This comes after the company received  8 new reports of battery packs in the U.S ., overheating or charring. One of them even caused a minor injury to the user while two had property damages, totaling $1100.  Those batteries were installed in laptops and mobile work stations between Dec 2015 to Dec 2018. They were also sold separately during that time period.         The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) of the US, has advised HP laptop users to immediately visit  HP’s website . Thereupon, users can find a page to check whether their batteries are prone or not. So, if any of you are using an HP laptop, then, maybe check if everything is alright. Especially, those who ordered their units from the US itself.  However, the company has advised users not to try removing the batteries themselves. As they have the potential to overheat and can be hazardous. And HP’s providing battery replacements by authorized technicians at no extra cost. Of course, that may not be applicable to the people here. But nevertheless, you should check your battery and be safe.  In addition, the firm is also releasing an update that puts affected hardware in “Battery Safety Mode”. That can make the notebook or workstation safe to use without the battery, by connecting to an HP adapter.

['Huawei Nova 4e with triple rear cameras and 32MP selfie shooter is finally official'],['Huawei'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 15, 2019']",2019-03-15 07:15:23+00:00,"['It has been a while the Chinese smartphone giant has released  Huawei Nova 4 . It was Huawei’s first phone with a hole punch display. The smartphone was brought at a midrange price point. However, the phone had a flagship chipset on the board, triple rear cameras and the fancy feature like the hole punch display. So it created quite a buzz in the smartphone market back then. And this time, the smartphone maker has presented a toned down version of the device. Dubbed as Huawei Nova 4e, the newbie also embraces triple rear cameras.  Huawei Nova 4e Overview:  On the display side, the Nova 4 features a 6.15-inch IPS panel enriched with Full-HD+ resolution. But unlike its bigger sibling, the newbie comes with a notch on the notch. The notch is really tiny and less obtrusive, unlike others.  As discussed earlier, the phone flaunts three cameras on its rear panel. The primary one embraces a 24MP sensor, which is accompanied by an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens and a 2MP depth sensor. The ultra-wide-angle camera stretches the field of view to 120-degrees due to which users can fit everything in the frame, which a normal human eye can see. On the front lies a 32MP selfie shooter, which rests on that minuscule notch, which I mentioned earlier.         Performance wise, the phone gets the HiSilicon Kirin 710 chipset paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. In terms of storage, Huawei Nova 4e comes with 128GB of onboard memory. As far as the software is concerned, the phone boots on Android Pie out of the box with EMUI 9 on the top.  Heading to the battery, a 3340mAh non-removable battery keeps the phone running. Adopting the modern trend, the phone also comes with USB Type-C port keeping the 3.5mm headphone jack intact. And another praiseworthy part of the device is that it also supports an 18-watt fast charging.  Huawei Nova 4 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.15-inch IPS LCD display  Resolution:\xa0 Full-HD+ (2312×1080 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio @ 415PPI  Chipset:\xa0 HiSilicon Kirin 710  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU:  Mali-G51 MP4  RAM:\xa0 4/6GB  Storage:\xa0 128GB; Expandable up to 512GB via SD card slot (Uses SIM2 Slot)  OS & UI:\xa0 Android Pie (v9.0) with EMUI 9 on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Triple camera – (24 MP, f/1.8, PDAF, wide-angle) + (8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, 120-degree field of view) + (2MP, f/2.4, depth sensor), LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 32MP, f/2.0  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 3340mAh non-removable Li-Po battery with 18W fast charging support; Uses USB Type-C  Colors:\xa0 Midnight Black, Pearl White, Gradient Blue   Huawei Nova 4e Price & Availability  The phone comes in three colors: Midnight Black, Pearl White, Gradient Blue.

As far as the global availability of the device is concerned, the phone will be relaunched as Huawei P30 Lite and will hit the market starting from 26 th  of March.   As far as the price goes, the 4/128GB of the Nova 4 is priced at CNY 1,999 ($298). Similarly, the 6GB/128GB variant of the device will demand a price of CNY 2,299 ($342) on the purchase.

['Huawei Watch GT Review – A line between fitness bands and smartwatches'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews', 'Smartwatch Price in Nepal']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['March 14, 2019']",2019-03-14 11:32:12+00:00,"['The world of smartwatches is tricky. There is no such thing as a perfect smartwatch that strikes a true balance between the features, complexity and battery life. Similarly, the Huawei Watch GT is one that runs but needs to work on its functionality. It appears to be more like a fitness band, but one that looks like a great traditional timepiece that catches your eye. But is it compelling enough for you to get one?   Huawei Watch GT Specifications:   Design : Leather or rubber strap, stainless steel bezels, 46.5 mm  Display : 1.39″ AMOLED, 454 x 454 resolution  Processor : Cortex-M4  RAM : 16 MB  Storage : 128 MB  OS : Lite OS  Connectivity : Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with GLONASS / Galileo  Sensors : Accelerometer, Gyro, Heart rate, Barometer, Compass  Battery : 420 mAh  Corresponding app : Huawei Health   Design  The design of this smartwatch is one of the best things about it. It’s not every day that your smart wearable looks like a classic timepiece. There are two variants of this smartwatch –\xa0 a sports version and a classic one. The sports one, with its rubbery design, really does look like a sports watch, while the classic one is the better looking. It’s  a leather strap with the steel casing and black bezels on a circular body  makes it close to a regular wrist-watch.            Huawei Watch GT Design   1  of 2                                      It has two buttons. The upper one lets you access the basic watch features while the other button takes you to the workout section. Underside, the watch is  ceramic  and even with slightly raised sensors, it rests comfortably on your wrist. And even if the strap is leather on top, the  bottom of it is a combination of silicone and rubber , which makes it comfortable to keep on your wrist at all times.      Huawei Watch GT Design Underneath   1  of 3               Leather Strap         Sensors         Underside                     You only get the watch in a single size, though – at  46.5 mm , it is big and looks masculine. Those with small hands might not go for it, but I actually like it. The only problem is that the leather strap is prone to discoloration due to the buckle placement. But that’s easily forgettable while wearing, so, maybe not something to worry about.   This watch is also  5 ATM Water-Resistant , meaning you can wear it for 50 meters underwater.  Display  On the display side, the  1.39” AMOLED display  looks great! It’s  454 x 454 resolution  makes it look vibrant. The icons and texts are sharp, with deep blacks and punchy colors. Brightness levels are also good enough, and you get good legibility in the sunlight, too.   There is also an  Auto-Brightness feature , which adjusts the brightness of the screen according to the environment. However, there is no “Always-On” feature on this one. The closest thing you have to that is the “Show Time” option in its settings toggle, which keeps the screen on for 5 minutes.  Another thing I’m concerned about is that there seems to be  no protection on the display . But the watch has survived the daily abuses pretty well. I’m a pretty clumsy person and even after occasional impacts on the wall, or door, there isn’t a scratch on it.  Overall, the display is likable, mostly, because it’s large and has a good pixel density.  Performance  This is where the watch falls short – it runs on Huawei’s new  Lite OS  – and it does seem really light! After all, it is running on  16 MB of RAM and 128 MB of storage . The chip inside it also has not been disclosed, but it is a  Cortex-M4 chip .  That selection of internal hardware doesn’t make it the most agile of smartwatches. It is easy to see that after a few swipes to the left and right. The transitions are not that smooth, and you’ll feel the jitters after some fast swipes.  That being said, the watch doesn’t do much either. I mean, it actually does a lot more than your  Fitbits  but is not as comprehensive as other smartwatches out there.  Swiping down on the home-screen toggles the settings shortcut, while swiping from the bottom up shows you your notifications. And this is where Huawei’s Lite OS has compromises. There is  no 3 rd  party app support . But after the latest update, you can now get notifications corresponding to the app, which was not the case before.   Swiping on the sides takes you to your  Heart Rate, Weather  and your  Activity Log . And that’s about it. Long press on the home screen allows you to choose from a select few  Watch Faces – a total of 13 , at the time of this review. The number might go up with newer updates.      Huawei Watch GT Screens   1  of 3               Heart Rate Monitor         Weather         Activity Log                     The top button takes you to the installed apps and functions like Stopwatch, Alarm, etc. And there’s even a Flashlight – which is nothing but your screen glowing white at max brightness. You can also access your workout records, activity logs, and sleep. The other button takes you the workout preset, where you can find a limited number of workouts. It mostly focuses on the general exercises – like running, walking, climbing and swimming. There are no gym workouts like on the  Samsung Galaxy Watch . But again, it costs like, a lot less than that, and this will be enough for the general populace, so, it’s okay.   One thing I liked about it a lot is its  continuous heart-rate monitor . It is constantly measuring your heart rate, and that makes other readings all the more accurate. For instance, your sleep, your walks, and other activities can be more accurate. All the logs are stored in the  Huawei Health App , which is the supporting app for this watch, and not the Huawei Wear.  This watch also comes with GPS tracking making for a good location and distance tracking. And that is useful in your outdoor walking or running sessions. Plus, the watch also lets you  track the intensity of your workouts  – like warm-up, fat-burning etc. The types of workouts aren’t much, but each one of them is pretty comprehensive.  With most of the features concentrated towards fitness tracking, this watch appears more like a fitness band, that looks like a regular watch. There are no other features like playing music or such. You can get  call alerts , but since you can’t use it to call or reply, you can only check the caller ID, and maybe choose whether to pick up, or reject it.  So, yes, the watch is not as comprehensive, and it mostly concentrated towards fitness tracking. But what it does, it does a great job at it.  Battery  This is the part where it shines through and through – a massive  420 mAh battery . Combined with the watch’s LiteOS, and the fact that it doesn’t do much, the battery life is excellent! When you wear a smartwatch that tracks your body activities continuously, it’s natural that you don’t want to take it off every other day and charge it.  And with this, you don’t have to! Huawei claims the battery will last you  two weeks  with normal use, and I got around 12 days. That’s pretty impressive for a smartwatch.   Plus, it charges fairly quickly. You get a charging dock with a  USB-C , and it  charges fully in less than two hours . Thanks to this, I didn’t have to charge it overnight. Which is why I have complete records of my sleep and activities.  Conclusion  To sum up, the Huawei Watch GT is one good fitness tracker. When I used the  Samsung Galaxy Watch , I said that it would be interesting to see Samsung make a toned-down variant of the watch for a lesser price. And this looks like just that. It removes the things that we don’t normally use and concentrates more on fitness and health.  But it does leave some things out – like 3 rd  party app support. And Lite OS, isn’t that appealing, especially with its jittery UI. So, for me, it’s still a bit expensive at a  $200 price tag . Especially, when Samsung launched the  Galaxy Watch Active  for a similar price, and that seems to do more than this. Of course, to me, the Galaxy Watch Active doesn’t look as attractive as this one, and the battery probably won’t last nearly as long either.  This is one great looking buffed-up fitness tracker with some smartwatch features and excellent battery life. But it still leaves some features to be desired. So, for me, it’s not a complete smartwatch, yet. Therefore, this is a line between fitness trackers and smartwatches.  This costs  Rs.20000, here, in Nepal , too, which is great pricing on Huawei’s part. If you’re into regular fitness stuff, and want continuous health monitoring without having to charge it every other night and don’t mind some slow UI, then, go for it. It makes me want more, but still, for what it is, it is good enough.  Pros:   Classy and elegant looking design  Stainless steel construction with leather and silicone strap  50 ATM Water resistance  Comfortable wear  Continuous heart-rate sensor  Two-week battery life   Cons:   LiteOS  Limited Watch Faces']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/huawei-watch-gt-review.jpg']

The Honor 10i will also be powered by the same chipset the 10 Lite is which is the Kirin 710 SoC. The CPU will be coupled with 4 GB RAM and Mali-G51 GPU. It will provide users with 128 GB of internal memory. The phone could also have external memory.         The major talking point of the Honor 10i is definitely the triple camera setup on the back. The leaked images showcase three vertically places cameras with an LED flash below. The setup will consist of a 24-megapixel primary lens, 2-megapixel depth sensor, and an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera. Up front, Honor will include a 32-megapixel selfie shooter.

Talking in an interview with a Harvard professor, Mark Zuckerberg shared Facebook’s plans to build a “brain-computer interface” that will be a big step in the development of Augmented Reality (AR). According to him, the social media company is in plans to make an AR device that will let them interact with various contents through their minds.  Zuckerberg explained this new product as a ‘brain-computer interface’ that will allow its users to interact and change their content with AR. It will let them move objects, change landscapes and navigate through applications just by thinking.        Also Read:  Facebook is at it again – tracking people who don’t even use Facebook!  While some news outlets have reported that this device will be Glasses, Wired has said that it will be like a shower cap which users put onto their head. The research Facebook is conducting is helped by the fact that scientists can already know what people are thinking about with a look at their neural activity.  Zuckerberg said to the professor, “The way that our phones work today, and all computing systems, organized around apps and tasks is fundamentally not how our brains work and how we approach the world.” He added, “That’s one of the reasons I’m just very excited long-term about especially things like augmented reality because it’ll give us a platform that I think actually is how we think about stuff.”  In his previous Facebook post, Mark Zuckerberg had mentioned that our brains haven’t been utilized to the fullest which is why Facebook is working on a system that will let users interact to contents, and even type with a device.  “ Our brains produce enough data to stream 4 HD movies every second. We’re working on a system that will let you type straight from your brain about 5x faster than you can type on your phone today. Eventually, we want to turn it into a wearable technology that can be manufactured at scale.”  Facebook is currently tainted due to the not-so-recent Cambridge Analytica scandal and the fact that it collects data of people who aren’t even the users of the site. So, it will be interesting to see how the public reacts to Facebook’s step when their new device comes out.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/facebook-mind-reading-device.jpg']

They are the official distributors of  Asus laptops in Nepal . We always recommend buying from official retailers for the utmost reliability and genuine products. They also provide you with VAT bill and two years of international warranty. With that aside, let’s get back to the Asus VivoBook X542U review.  Asus VivoBook X542U Specifications:   Dimensions : Plastic body, 380 x 251 x 23.2 mm, 2.30kg  Display : 15.6″ Full-HD (1920 x 1080) TN Panel with 220 nits max brightness, 56% sRGB, 45% NTSC  Keyboard:  Chiclet keyboard with isolated Num key  Processor:  Intel® Core™ i5-8250U Processor  RAM:  4 GB DDR4 (2x slots)  Graphics:  NVidia GeForce MX130  Battery:  38Wh  Adapter:\xa0 45W  Storage:  1 TB HDD  Webcam:\xa0 VGA Webcam  Connectivity:  802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.1  Ports:  1 x COMBO audio jack, 1 x VGA port, 2 x Type A USB3.0 (USB3.1 GEN1), 1 x Type C USB3.0 (USB3.1 GEN1), 1 x USB 2.0 port(s), 1 x RJ45 LAN Jack for LAN insert, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Fingerprint (Optional), 1 x SD card reader, 1X AC adapter plug  Price:  Rs.95,000 (Rs 85,500 after discount)   Design and Build  Starting off with the design, it looks a bit dated, with those chunky screen bezels, and bulky presence. It’s built around plastic which helps with the weight and keeps the cost down. Although the build could have certainly been better. The laptop is prone to an ample amount of flex all around, and that was a bit troubling for me. Overall, it’s an outplayed design from Asus, they just slapped some new hardware in the same old exterior. Laptop manufacturers do it every now and then, and it isn’t a bad thing either.         Just saying, this laptop could have turned out a lot better in terms of design.  Display  This laptop comes with a TN panel, so the viewing angles suffer a lot. The display is sharp, but honestly, the choice to go with a TN panel is the biggest drawback for this laptop. Everything is washed out, and to say the color reproduction (56% sRGB) is bad would be an understatement. Brightness is average at around 220 nits, mated with a matte display, it’s strictly an indoor only panel.   The display seems to be the laptop’s biggest weakness, with subpar viewing angles and pretty washed out colors.  Performance  If you plan on buying this laptop, we highly recommend you add an additional 4GB of RAM. Our review unit came with just 4GB by default, and that’s just not enough these days. The laptop faced lots of stutters and froze every now and then, mostly due to the lack of RAM. Other than that, the laptop’s performance is what I would say average. It does manage to keep itself cool though.  It also comes with an MX130 GPU, which helps around with applications like Photoshop and light gaming (720p seems to be the sweet spot). Photoshop ran fine (opening times were an eyesore due to the HDD). As for gaming, I tested CS: GO that was totally playable. A few games refused to even start and I suspect it was the lack of RAM again. But to be fair, it wasn’t designed for gaming.  I recommend you add an M.2 stick (even a 128GB one) and 4GB more RAM (there is an empty slot waiting for that extra memory), you are going to feel the boost in performance and the added cost is totally worth it.  Connectivity and Battery  This one gets stellar connectivity, including one of the best ports selection I’ve seen on a laptop yet. You rarely get a USB Type C, DVD drive and a VGA port on the same device. AC wifi comes integrated alongside Bluetooth 4.1. The speakers are loud but the quality is average, and the M.2 slot we mentioned earlier uses a SATA 3 connection. And if you look at the bottom, the easy access maintenance cover holds the two RAM slots, of which one is empty.      Ports selection   1  of 3               Left         Right         Bottom                     The 38Whr battery lasts around 4 hours under normal to moderate usage. This is pretty standard among laptops with similar battery sizes. Charging takes around an hour to reach a 100% form nill. Now, people, in general, might not care much about the below average battery life, but for me, this was a deal breaker. They could have gotten rid of the CD-drive and utilized that space for more battery, but well.  Keyboard and trackpad  This is where the laptop excels. The trackpad on this one is among the best out there. Tracking is on point, the buttons are very tactile and it gets a smooth finish. The pad itself is pretty spacious and that will come in handy for gesture controls. The Keyboard is also pretty great, with medium strokes and the pressure points are on point. Bring a 15-inch laptop, the number pad seems like a give. The only thing to complain here is it’s lack of backlighting.   Both the keyboard and trackpads on Asus laptops have always been one of my favorites, and this one does not disappoint.  Conclusion   Starting with what the laptop excels at: keyboard, trackpad, connectivity and that’s about it. if you want a laptop for any one of those three reasons, go ahead. But there is a high chance you will be more interested in its drawbacks. For instance, the display is sharp and bright (enough), but the color reproduction and viewing angles just bad. The battery life isn’t good either, added with it’s mediocre out of the box performance and compromised craftsmanship, I recommend you take your money elsewhere.

['Xiaomi Redmi Go Review – An entry level beast!!'],"['Xiaomi', 'Redmi', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['March 13, 2019']",2019-03-13 09:22:55+00:00,"['For an asking price of Rs. 9000, what would you expect from a phone? Not much, right? I had the same feeling when I switched to the  Xiaomi Redmi Go  as my daily driver. My expectations were already low. I was prepared for below-average user experience and lots of frustrations. But I’m glad to say I was not as correct. This phone isn’t half as bad as I’d thought. Maybe because all the phones in that price range I’ve tried till now have failed to impress me, but this is a different story.   Xiaomi Redmi Go specifications:   Operating System: \xa0Android 8.1 Oreo (Go edition)  CPU: \xa0Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53  Chipset: \xa0Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 (28nm)  GPU: \xa0Adreno 308  SIM (s): \xa0Dual SIM  Display: \xa05.0 inches HD IPS LCD screen with 16:9 aspect ratio  Rear cameras:\xa0 8 MP with LED flash and HDR  Video: \xa01080p  Front camera:\xa0 5 MP with HDR  RAM: \xa01 GB  ROM:  8 or 16 GB (expandable up to 128 GB with a dedicated slot)  Battery: \xa0Non- removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery, MicroUSB 2.0  Sensors: \xa0Accelerometer, proximity  Colors: \xa0Blue and Black  Others: \xa0Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, WiFi Direct, hotspot   Build and Design         Right from the start, you know this phone cuts corners. The phone looks and feels cheap. It appears boring and weights like a feather, and yet I’ve seen worse at this price. The good thing here is its small form factor, ease of use, slight slipperiness but totally manageable. Plastic seems to be the material of choice, but I’m not complaining at all. It also feels pretty sturdy, unlike a few other budget Xiaomi phones.      Button Placement   1  of 4               Bottom         right         left         Top                        The back is plain with a camera and an LED flash on top, alongside the Mi branding at the bottom center. The expandable storage and SIM tray are on the left, while the right side is occupied by the volume rocker and power button. The buttons are mushy and unsatisfying to click, but for the price, we can let it slide. The headphone jack is placed at the top, while at the bottom you’ll find the microUSB and a speaker grill.  You get what you pay for, and rest assured you are getting the most for your money.  Display  You get a  5-inch display  with a traditional  16:9 aspect ratio . It’s a small phone with huge bezels that doesn’t make for joyful user experience. Having said that, it’s wasn’t a huge deal-breaker. Because other than the form factor, the panel itself is bright, with good colors, and the sharpness is on point.   Considering what its competition (there are very few) offers, this is one of (if not the best) display you can get in its category.  Camera   The cameras were surprisingly good for the price. It managed to take some really great shots under good lighting conditions. While the image quality might appear a bit blur before taking the picture, end results come out better. Although they aren’t as sharp as I would like them to be. As for other lighting conditions (indoors), the photos come out grainy, lack details and are pretty much unusable. And it just gets worse in low light conditions.      Rear Camera Sample   1  of 13               Redmi Go Camera sample 5         Redmi Go Camera sample 3         Redmi Go Camera sample 2         Redmi Go Camera sample 4         Redmi Go Camera sample 7         Redmi Go Camera sample         Redmi Go Indoor 2         Redmi Go Indoor         Redmi Go Indoor 3         Redmi Go Low Light 1         Redmi Go Low Light 2         Redmi Go Low Light 3         Redmi Go Low Light 4                                                   The front camera shares the same story. Under good lighting, selfies come out decent, but indoor and low light conditions, it’s pretty much unusable. Then again, you can’t expect any more from this phone. Just look at the camera samples. That should give you a better idea of what it’s capable of. Either way, the camera’s performance should not make or break your smartphone buying decision, at least for the Redmi Go.      Selfie camera   1  of 4               Redmi Go Selfie Good lighting 2         Redmi Go Selfie Good lighting         Redmi Go Selfie Indoor 2         Redmi Go selfie indoor                        The cameras can be deemed “OK at best”.  Performance  A combo of middling hardware paired with great software makes for a fairly usable smartphone. It’s not bad, and that…was a huge surprise for me. Apps run well with their fair share of stutters and lags but nothing unlivable. Xiaomi is betting on Android Go to do the heavy lifting, and it doesn’t disappoint. The phone feels fast enough, browsing through the UI is smooth, and as far as gaming isn’t concerned, the performance is average.   Xiaomi probably expected its users to make do with “Lite” or “GO” editions of apps. But I was able to run normal versions of the apps just fine. The only problem was, there isn’t enough space to fit them. As for games, PUBG failed to even run, but light games like Temple Run or Knife hit were playable. In fact, Free Fire at the lowest settings was running with a few stutters every now and then.  Performance is good, usable for social media and light games, thanks to its software optimization.  Software  The Redmi Go, as the name suggests runs on  Android Go  based on Android 8.1.0. This phone does not, at all, feel like a Xiaomi phone and that’s something I liked a lot. The UI is as basic as it gets, with almost no bloatware on board, apart from a few (two) Mi apps. It’s simple to use, with no excessive features that no one uses anyway. The phone runs on Mint Launcher as default which could use a few bug fixes.      UI & Software   1  of 8               Lock screen         Home screen         Drop down menu         App icon tray         Settings         Display settings         Phone status         System Update                                    Overall, the phone’s biggest strength seems to be its software, keeping the phone running at a steady pace.  Battery  The  3000 mAh battery  will last you around 4 hours (screen on time) under normal usage. I found myself draining the battery by the end of the day. My normal usage consisted of calls, texting, social media, lots of YouTube and a bit of Temple Run. A full charge takes a little over three hours via the default adapter in the box. It does not get any type of fast charging support, but I always put it on charge every night so that never bothered me.   Four hours of screen on time, in general, is one day’s usage for most people, and this phone pushes out just that.  Extras  The phone gets three slots, two for SIMs and one for expandable storage. It supports 4G on both networks, a welcome feature, especially for an entry-level smartphone. Call quality seemed fine, but some of my friends complained about added noise as opposed to my primary phone ( OPPO F7 ). This one also gets adaptive brightness, which is usually missing on most budget phones at its price.  Conclusion  The Xiaomi Redmi Go is, in the simplest terms, is “worth it”. You can look around all you want, but all these features packed into a phone that costs just Rs 9000 is hard to find. Performance is good with average battery life; cameras are OK and the display is fine. For the basic user, this is the phone to get. It’s basically better than any other phone in its category I’ve used, and could make a great gift for your grandparents, to say the least.  Pros and Cons of Xiaomi Redmi Go      Pros  Cons    HD Display  8GB Storage is quite low    Light Software  The battery life isn’t spectacular    Price Friendly  Cameras are subpar']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Xiaomi-Redmi-Go.jpg']

No one knows… But it won’t stop the company from coming out with these new techs. (I would call it innovation, but there are others who already beat Apple to it!)  Anyways, the latest in the company’s patent line is  Apple AR Glasses ! Now, there were rumors about the company working on augmented reality technology, but this time, it might be official. The once-upon-a-time trillion dollar company filed a patent that teases a wearable tech that can be used with your iPhone.  Credit:  Patently Apple  AR is not new for Apple, though. It started its venture in the AR world with  ARKit  – its Augmented Reality platform for developers. And that brought us a lot of apps on iPads and iPhones.        According to Patently Apple, the patent which was submitted August 2018, is titled  Systems, Methods and Graphical User Interfaces for Interacting With Augmented and Virtual Reality Environments. \xa0That’s quite a lot to take in, but of course, we will see a shorter version of it when / if it comes out commercially. The patent shows the creation of a virtual user interface that can be used on a device looking like an iPhone as well as a wireless headset.  Credit:  Patently Apple  The headset will provide a live view of a portion of the contents that are visible in the line-of-sight of the camera, and can generate video outputs. Users can, then, use a “touch sensitive device” or an iPhone / iPad to interact with the augmented reality environment.  Now, Apple has already previously filed a patent for an AR headset, back in 2017. And last year, the company described using a mixed reality headset for image editing, drawing, presentation, making calls, etc. And now, they’re investigating touch panels, voice activation via Siri, and head gestures to control the glasses. So, this only confirms we’ll be seeing AR devices from the company soon.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-Glasses.png']
"['Samsung Galaxy A90, Galaxy A40, and Galaxy A20e listed on company’s UK website']",['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 11, 2019']",2019-03-11 07:17:21+00:00,"['Samsung has taken the wraps off the  Galaxy A10 ,  Galaxy 30 , and  Galaxy A50  smartphones so far. However, ahead of the official announcement of the device, Samsung’s UK branch just opened the product pages of the Galaxy A20e, Galaxy A40, and the Galaxy A90 smartphones.  Samsung Galaxy A90  Earlier rumors had suggested the existence of the Galaxy A90 smartphone. And this accidental (or intentional) placement of the device on the company’s website has proved its existence. Although the product page hasn’t revealed any of the features of the device. But the earlier speculations have cued that the phone will have a rotating pop-up camera mechanism. This could be Samsung’s attempted to kill the bezels and the notch. So we can see a new infinity type of display design on this handset. The phone is also speculated to feature a triple camera setup at the back.  Previous leaks also claimed that the handset will bear a 6.41-inch Super AMOLED display with an in-display fingerprint scanner. On the performance side, the phone will get Snapdragon chipset paired with 6GB/8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard memory. Software-wise, the phone will evidently feature Android Pie out of the box with Samsung’s One UI on the top.        Samsung Galaxy A90 was also supposed to be the most premium mid-range device from Samsung. Earlier speculations indicated that the phone could launch only in China. But the inclusion of the device in the UK’s website has quite indicated that the phone could launch on the global scale.  Samsung Galaxy A40  UK website has a listing of the Galaxy A40. But even before that, the A40 already went live in Germany earlier this month with the model number of SM-A405FN/DS. However, no specs have been spilled so far.  But the naming scheme definitely cues that the specs on the phone will come with the intermediate features of the Galaxy A30 and the Galaxy A50. However, rumors suggest that the phone will come with Exynos 7885 chipset coupled with 4GB of RAM. Other than that, no specs of the device have reached the rumor mill.  Samsung Galaxy A20e  Last time we saw the “e” moniker was on the Samsung Galaxy S10e. Since the Galaxy S10e is toned of the standard Galaxy S10. The case can be similar to the Galaxy A20e. But there are also rumors that the Samsung Galaxy A20e could be the regional variant of the A20. Since the Galaxy A20 has not launched yet and there are not much leaks and rumors about the Galaxy 202, we do not have more information to discuss on the topic. Nonetheless, we can presume that the Galaxy A20 and the A20e will come with Android Pie out of the box with One UI on the top.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/samsung-galaxy-a90-a40-a20e.jpg']
['JBL Clip 3 Review – Small packages have the biggest explosions!'],"['Portable Speaker', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['March 11, 2019']",2019-03-11 06:42:22+00:00,"['Choosing a portable speaker is a tricky business – especially since there are quite a few ones out there. But JBL’s mini speakers have always been the hot favorite among most, maybe because they’re also quite affordable. The  JBL Clip 3  costs\xa0 $60  on Amazon, and\xa0  Rs.7300 , here, in Nepal. And is it worth that money?    BUY HERE  Design         The JBL Clip 3 comes in the same round form factor as its predecessor, the  JBL Clip 2 . But there are some obvious differences. First, the size is a bit bigger, and it is also slightly thicker. This makes the Clip 3 slightly heavier at  210 grams . The carabiner or the clip, (whatever you all it) here has also changed, and I think this is a bit more practical. Plus, the clip on the JBL Clip 3 is integrated around the speaker, i.e. it wraps around the perimeter of the speaker. This makes for a good bumper and adds protection.   But the integrated clip comes at the cost of the 3.5 mm audio cord that enabled you to connect it to your phone or laptop directly without Bluetooth. That helped save battery, but sadly, this feature is now not available. However, there is an audio port, so, you can connect it directly, but there is no cable inside the box. So, you’ll have to get your own. There’s also a  micro USB port  for charging besides the audio port and is enclosed by this tight seal, which adds to its water resistance.  But it is already  IPX7 Water Resistant , so, you can play it while you shower or such. And this thing floats too! So, if you’re having a mini pool party of sorts, then, you can use it for that as well.   Plus, there’s a  rubber pad   on the bottom , that aids the grip even while lying on the table so that it won’t slide off the surface if you mistakenly push it off. As for the buttons, the Volume and Play / Pause buttons are on the speaker mesh itself.  Sound Quality  JBL speakers never compromise on the sound quality, and this one doesn’t either. The Clip 3 plays rich sound and makes for a very immersive audio experience. It is quite a bit better than Clip 2, to say the least. It could still use more bass, but even with what it has, it’s still better than its predecessor. This one sounds fuller, and it’s also louder.  And the bass is actually okay for a speaker this size. Playing bass requires something larger, so, the constraint is its size. If you want something with a lot of bass, go for the  JBL Flip 4 . The bass on this one is only noticeable while playing tracks with a lot of bass. For other types of music, it performs really well.  The sound has got high definition and rich tone. If you’re familiar with “ bright sounds ” and “ warm sounds ”, this one is on the brighter side…but not to the extreme. That is why the audio from this speaker is crisp and has got clarity. You’ll have no problem understanding the lyrics of the songs you’re listening to. And this little speaker can handle the highs and lows very well. Listening Bohemian Rhapsody to test that led to a highly exhilarating experience.   Also, you get quite the head-room. That means, there is none or a negligible amount of distortion even at very high volumes. Even at full volume, the sound quality is good. Of course, if you’re listening to rock in a closed room, then, high volume isn’t advised. But if you’re having a party or get-together, then, it’s okay.  Another thing is, this speaker might not be for metal fans. It does an okay job on metal tracks, but the size is the constraint here. Most portable speakers can’t handle metal very well, and the ones who do can be quite expensive.  Just like there’s the  Bose Soundlink Micro  with similar size, but can give you better bass than this one, but again, costs like $100!  Connectivity and Battery  Moving on to the other aspects of the speaker, this speaker has  Bluetooth 4.1 , so, the range is only about  10 meters . Connecting it to your phone or laptop is very easy. You just pair it once, and for other times, it connects to your device automatically.  There is also no latency for the audio to play. The only slight delay can be seen while playing/pausing a song for about 0.5 seconds, and those are seen on all kinds of speakers!  The Clip 3 misses out on the  JBL Connect+ . That is, you can’t connect multiple JBL Clip 3 speakers to a single device via the Connect+ app. That feature was there in the Clip 2, but it’s not present here. Still, it’s okay. Who owns multiple JBL Clip 3 speakers anyway?  As for the battery, this small speaker has got a  1000 mAh battery , which claims up to  10 hours of battery life . And the speaker does get close to 10 hours at medium volumes. If you listen to it at very high volumes, you’ll get about 4 hours of battery life. Charging is done via a micro USB cable. There is no adapter included inside the box. And if you use your phone’s regular adapter, it will take about  3 hours to fully charge it . For a speaker as small as this one, I think that’s all well.  Conclusion  The JBL Clip 3 is a great speaker for the price. It’s got a very nice design, the right amount of heft, and a sound quality I can really not get bored listening to. You can use this even while gaming to make your gaming experience more immersive.  Venue: Yellow Pomelo  I wouldn’t recommend this for the metal-heads out there, but for others, it does a great job. And I think the price is right as well. But I’d like to point out that the  Clip 2 is available for $40 in Amazon . So, if you’re looking for something cheaper, that’s a good deal.  However, here, in Nepal, the Clip 3 provides a better value for money, as the Clip 2 still costs upwards of Rs.6000. So, there you have it, the Clip 3 – good things come in small packages!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jbl-clip-3.jpg']
['Nepal Government set to introduce a regulation for e-commerce sites'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['March 11, 2019']",2019-03-11 05:10:50+00:00,"['E-commerce sites are in a growing number these days. The e-commerce companies are gaining popularity every day as more people are opting for buying good online.  So, the Government of Nepal is now looking to regulate the sites that are really hitting it off, even with their slow start when compared against the neighboring states. The government only recently introduced policies related to the regulation of social media platforms in use in Nepal.  The government plans to come up with a list of policies that will help the public, and make the e-commerce companies more responsible for their services.        Talking to The Kathmandu Post, Toya Narayan Gyawali, Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, said that a draft consisting of the regulations will be prepared within a month. He also mentioned that the draft will then be proposed to the Cabinet for approval.  With the growing number of e-commerce sites, there aren’t any policies regulating their work. And it’s probably the reason why there are a lot of complaints from the customers. Therefore, to make the online market free of any misconduct and fraudulent activities, the government will be looking forward to implementing this regulation.  Talking to the Post, Gyawali mentioned that the government has already held talks with the private sector for the preparation of the draft. China and India have seen a rise in their country’s online marketplace, and Nepal will look to achieve the same feat with this new regulation in place.  With 63% of the population online in 2017, Nepal is seeing a surge of online shoppers. There are a lot of e-commerce sites like Daraz and Sastodeal that offer a variety of products to their customers.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nepal-government-e-commerce-regulation.jpg']

And you don’t even have to be a part of Facebook for you to fall victim to its latest scandal.  So, there aren’t many who are unaware of  Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica  scandal. The company faced severe criticisms and bad publicity. And after that, the company revised all its privacy policies. But apparently, they haven’t had enough of stealing the users’ private data. It is well known that Facebook can keep records of its users, and we, as users, can choose what it can keep track of, and what we keep to ourselves.  But in this latest issue, you don’t even need to have a Facebook account! Some of the apps you use on your phone send user data to the social media giant automatically. A study by  Privacy International  in December 2018 revealed as many as 23 apps were doing so. Since the results went public, some apps like  Spotify ,  Skyscanner  and  Kayak  are taking corrective measures, but many have yet to do so.         Apps like  Yelp, Duolingo, King James Bible App , and two Muslim Prayer apps –  Kibla Connect  and  Muslim Pro , send personal data to Facebook before the user can provide consent. That is due to the fact that the apps are based on  Facebook’s SDK (Software Development Kit) , which is designed to automatically transmit data to Facebook when the app is opened.  Facebook’s SDK is Facebook’s business product that apps integrate into their code to link their apps with Facebook. The apps embed the SDK onto their code itself, and so, it is quite difficult to leave that part out without making major modifications to the code.  However, Facebook claims that they’re not to blame for this. They say that developers can choose whether to collect app events or not, depending on the circumstances. And all the developers need to have an appropriate legal basis to collect and process user information. Also, they are provided guidance on how to comply with Facebook SDK standards. In addition, under GDPR regulations, the legal obligation for processing third-party app information lies with the app developers themselves.  Nevertheless, what kind of apps the users open and how often can assemble a picture of someone’s identity and interests. So, no matter whose fault it is, its the users who are the victims.  The charity, Privacy International, is now urging the developers to fix this issue and Facebook to change their default settings, so this won’t occur in the future. Some of the apps have started taking steps regarding these steps. Duolingo, the language learning app, stated that it will release an update soon that’ll fix this issue. While Yelp denies that any of its iOS or Android apps send users’ personal information.  This latest scandal may not be as troublesome for the social media giant as some other scandals it faced. But still, users privacy is still the key concern even after their acclaimed innocence and rectification.  Now, you may think there is no reason to fret. After all, we don’t even use most of these apps, here in Nepal. And even if we did, who cares about your information, right? After all, we are nobody. But in today’s world, data means money and power. Which is why almost all the apps you use are after your information. So, be careful of what kind of permission you give the apps on your phone, or the random ones on Facebook.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/facebook-scandal.jpg']

Since last year’s  P20 Pro  was the smartphone to have scored the highest in the DxOmark, the  launch of P30 and P30 Pro  has been eagerly awaited in the tech community. But that’s not the only Huawei products launching in that grand event. Huawei is reportedly launching two wearables alongside the P30 smartphones. Owing to the recent leaks, two smartwatches, dubbed as Huawei Watch GT Active and Elegant will share the stage with the P30 devices.  The alleged leak, which came from the German website WinFuture gives us a clear idea of the device what it may look like. Going through the images, the Huawei Watch GT Active shared an uncanny resemblance with the last year’s  Huawei Watch GT . But a slight change in the color scheme of the bezel, shade of the lines and numbers on the watch are definitely enough to differentiate between the two. The leaked images also showed that the watch in two color schemes of the straps: Dark Green and Orange. But there has not been a solid report stating the existence of merely two color variants of the watch. When it comes to the Huawei Watch GT Elegant, the wearable is tipped to come in Black and White color options.  In terms of specifications, both of these wearables are said to come with the same 1.39-inch OLED display. The resolution will be 454 x 454 pixels, which means both the devices will pack 326 pixels on every inch. Since the size and resolution of the device haven’t changed from the Watch GT and other specs are still under the veil, we are yet unsure about how much of an upgrade will these devices bring on the table. Nonetheless, we can be sure that these devices will feature the latest version of the company’s proprietary Light OS on the software front.        As far as the rumors hold true, these devices are said to launch on Paris at an event on March 26 alongside the P30 devices. But that’s not the only thing we know so far. This alleged leak also claims that Huawei Watch GT Active will be priced at EUR 249.

The  OPPO A5s  is launching soon, but as usual, we have the specs, leaks, and rumors right here.  Oppo A5s Overview  According to the leaks and renders, the Oppo A5s looks, more or less, the same as the Oppo A3s. Except that, this one features a  rear-mounted fingerprint sensor , which the A3s didn’t have. And the notch up front has changed to a small  tear-drop  one from an ugly looking big notch. Besides that, there aren’t any changes aesthetically.  Source: MySmartPrice  You get the same plastic body, and it still looks bold. The display is also in the same size – a  6.2″ IPS LCD with HD+ resolution . For a screen this big, an HD+ resolution can be a bummer, but it is supposed to be a budget phone after all. They seem to have done a great job with minimizing the notch.        The camera department also sees no improvements – the phone will have the same dual-camera setup of  13 MP and a 2 MP depth sensor . And the front camera, too, will be the same 8 MP, but the aperture size has been improved from f/2.2 to f/2.0. The slightest bit of improvement for capturing selfies.  Inside, the phone will be powered by  Helio P35 chipset . It is a considerable improvement over the Snapdragon 450 of the A3s. It should mean a slightly improved overall and gaming performance. The phone will come in  three RAM variants  apparently – 2 GB, 3 GB, and 4 GB while the A3s have 2 and 3 GB variants. The storage, too, varies from  32 GB and 64 GB .

Such features definitely make a device premium, however, Apple products are mostly expensive when it comes to the price. And the pricing sounds even more exorbitant when compared to similar products in the Android ecosystem. That could be one of the reasons why Apple products suffered a decline in sales in 2018. To cope with that sale declination, Apple was also found  slashing the price of its products on multiple occasions . Although that strategy may have worked on a temporary basis, Apple is now seeking an efficacious solution to cope with the sales decline. And the report claims that Apple is working to bring affordable iPads in the year 2019.  In fact, this strategy is nothing new from the tech giant. Apple had launched the  iPhone XR  as an affordable iPhone last September with some compromises on the internals. However, the handset was priced at $749, which was still expensive than most of the premium flagship Android devices available in the market. But the new reports suggest that this affordable version of the iPad will implement Apple’s previous philosophy. So in that proclaimed affordable iPad, we can see similar design language with a few upgrades on the internals.  Some reports also claim that Apple would revive the Apple ID, which it notoriously ditched last year. Furthermore, we can see a rejuvenation of the 3.5mm headphone jack. The headphone jack has been long lost on the iPhones, which was last seen on iPhone on the iPhone 6 series devices. Even the iPad Pro 2018 suffered a similar fate last year.        Further reports cues that this affordable iPad Mini 5 will also ditch the Apple Pencil in order to cut the manufacturing costs. There is also the possibility that Apple could drop its proprietary Lightning port in the favor of USB Type-C port.  But these are just the speculations hovering in the tech world. Apple has not made an official announcement regarding the existence of this device yet.

Be it just a leak or the launch. And in that already popular list of Galaxy A-series device falls the recently launched  Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50 . Both of these handsets were unveiled at  MWC 2019 . In that grand event, many tech reviewers had praised Samsung for their change in strategy and for bringing such notable devices. Although the price of the device was kept under the veil at that time, Samsung recently launched the device in India and announced the price. And not so long after the announcement, Samsung Nepal has brought these new midrangers in Nepal.  Samsung Galaxy A30 Overview:  Heading to the Samsung Galaxy A30 features, the most notable thing about the device is a tall 6.4-inch display with a tiny notch on the top. But unlike the Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20 devices, the display here is called an “Infinity-U display”. Furthermore, the display here is Super AMOLED one, so the users can find deeper blacks and brighter whites in the contents when compared with the typical IPS panels.  On the performance side, the phone has got the Octa-core Exynos 7904 chipset with 3GB or 4GB of RAM alongside. And talking about the storage, the phone comes in 32GB and 64GB format with a dedicated SD card slot for memory expansion. Making use of this slot, users can expand their storage up to 512GB.         As far as the camera is concerned, the boasts a dual camera setup at the back, which is a combination of 16MP and 5MP sensors. The secondary camera on the back is an ultra-wide-angle shooter. Since most of the smartphones at a similar price comes with a depth sensor, the addition of an ultra-wide-angle lens on this device has added an extra perspective while taking the shots. As far as the front camera goes, a 16MP selfie snapper does the job.   Software-wise, the phone boots on Android Pie out of the box. The phone also enjoys Samsung’s custom skin OneUI on the top. The phone also comes with a sizable 4000mAh battery with 15-Watt fast charging support.

The display here is enriched with Full-HD+ resolution packing 403 pixels in every inch. So needless to say that the contents on this handset will look sufficiently sharp with great color depth. Under that display rests a fingerprint sensor. And for the price it asks for, the inclusion of under-display fingerprint sensor is notably praiseworthy.   In terms of camera, the Samsung Galaxy A50 flaunts a triple camera setup at the back. The primary 25MP shooter is backed by an 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera and a 5MP depth sensor. So not just the portrait shots, users can also get a stretched field of view from this device. On the front lies a 25MP shooter, which comes with an f/2.0 lens.   Even on the performance side, the A50 has got quite a boost when compared with the A30. It flaunts a rather capable Exynos 9610 chipset, whose performance is comparable with Snapdragon 660. Alongside the processor comes either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. And talking about the onboard memory, users have the option to choose from 64GB and 128GB variants. Plus, there is a dedicated SD card slot to expand the storage up to 512GB in case of insufficiency.  Moving on to the software, the phone has embraced the latest Android Pie (v9.0) out of the box. And the software on this device is flavored by Samsung’s OneUI on the top. As far as the battery on the device is concerned, a 4000mAh non-removable battery powers the device.

Still, the site says it will be updated with full specs before the launch soon enough. However, we do have certain key specs of the device.  The phone will probably have a glossy plastic body, as per the trend with mid-rangers today, and following the Nova 4. While that remains to be seen, it is certain that the screen will be a  6.15″ TFT LCD panel  with  Full HD+ resolution . The phone will be powered by Huawei’s own  Kirin 710  processor and will be available in multiple RAM variants. There is a  4 GB / 128 GB  option as well as a  6 GB / 128 GB  variant.

It’s only official that the selfie camera will be a  32 MP  one. Still, there are rumors that out of the triple-rear camera setup will comprise of a  20 MP + 16 MP + 2 MP lens .

With a budget-friendly price tag, the phone will go head to head against the  Samsung Galaxy M20  (Rs. 17,190) and  Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite  (Rs. 19,999).   Huawei Y7 Pro 2019 Overview  Since the phone belongs in the lower mid-range section, there are not many new things to expect in here. You get a 6.26″ IPS HD+ display with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. Plus, the display is protected by Gorilla Glass, but it has not been specified as to which.        As per the norm at present, you get a dual-camera at the back. The dual-camera setup comprises of a 13 MP primary camera and a 2 MP depth sensor. The front has a 16 MP camera for selfies. But the back houses nothing else – you don’t get a fingerprint sensor at all. There’s only Face Unlock, which uses the front camera, so it’s not that secure.   Under the hood, the phone is powered by a Snapdragon 450 processor, which is typically found in budget phones. In addition, it packs 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. You can expand the memory up to 512 GB via microSD card. Furthermore, it has 4000 mAh of battery, but it still uses a micro USB port. Again, another poor choice for a smartphone that has “2019” in the name itself!  The international price for the phone is around $170, and so, the Nepali price of Rs. 18,490 is good enough.

What the company did or didn’t isn’t up to me to decide, so I will hold my judgments. But first, the context. Most of you might know Huawei as a smartphone maker. But they are also the world’s biggest telecommunication equipment manufacturer. And you probably know that the US government has banned its federal agencies from using Huawei equipment.  The US government has listest Huawei as a security threat making claims that the company has close ties with the Chinese Government. On top of that, there are claims that Huwaei has also stolen technologies from others. Following these accusations, Huawei’s Deputy Chairman Guo Ping had a few words to share. Ping accused the US Congress of acting as the “judge, jury and executioner” in relation to the ban.  In the press conference today (Thursday), Ping states,        “This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming US consumers.”  Now, the company has announced they will be suing the US govt claiming the legislation is unconstitutional. The lawsuit focuses on a provision known as the National Defence Authorization Act. Section 899. The law prohibits executive govt agencies from using or owning telecommunication hardware manufactured by Huawei or ZTE. To this, the Huawei’s lawyers oppose that the provision in the NDAA is against the US constitution.  The lawsuit was filed in Texas, their defense being, an individual or group singled out for punishment without trial, which violates the US constitution. Guo added, “The US Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products.” Ping also said, “We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort.”']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Huawei-US-lawsuit.jpg']

Well, how about you check out the  Redmi Note 7 Pro ?  Meizu Note 9 Overview  The Meizu Note 9 is a mid-range phone from the Chinese company. That’s because you get a  Snapdragon 675  inside it, which stands on the mid-range side. Plus, you get two RAM options,  4 GB  and a  6 GB . And that too is pretty standard these days.

However, unlike the Galaxy S10 Plus 5G, the resolution here will Full-HD+, which is quite a norm for a mid-range device. Samsung Galaxy A60 display will also feature a tiny notch on the top, which will go by the name of “Infinity-U”. A 32MP selfie snapper accommodates on that tiny notch. Furthermore, the display on this device has also been a house to a fingerprint sensor. But till the date, we have no information whether the in-display fingerprint sensor here would be an optical one or ultrasonic one.        Another major highlight of the handset would be its battery. The leaks tip that the phone will boast a massive 4500mAh battery. And given the Super AMOLED display of the device, it can provide a prolonged endurance on the day to day usage.  Performance wise, the phone gets the Snapdragon 6150 chipset, which is supposedly a successor to the Snapdragon 675. On the benchmark side, SD6150 outperformed the SD675 in the single-core test, however, it lags quite behind on the multi-core test. So how good of a performer the A60 will be, we are yet to see. But if these leaks are true, we can expect 6/8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard memory alongside the processor. Since Samsung hasn’t yet given up on the SIM card slot just yet, we can expect that the storage could be expandable as well. And needless to worry, there will be a USB Type-C and 3.5mm headphone jack as well.        1  of 2               Snapdragon 675 GeekBench score         Snapdragon 6150 GeekBench Score                  Samsung Galaxy A60 launch date and Price  The specs sheet has also written “19.4” on the “launch” row. So we can expect the phone to launch on the 19 th  of April or sometime in the month. A few days back, the price of the  Samsung Galaxy A50  was announced. And the 6/64GB variant of the phone was priced at INR 22,990. Since the A60 would be more premium than the A50, we can expect a slight bump in the price.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/samsung-galaxy-a60-specs.jpg']

The flagship killer company might give its users a motorized pop-up camera in the upcoming OnePlus 7!  It’s amazing how companies move on with their technologies so fast.

Anyways, some images have been leaked of the upcoming OnePlus 7 and it does not show a notch, rather it shows a pop-up camera. These are not official pictures though.         Likewise, the OnePlus 7 is reported to have a 6.4-inch display and as the company says, no wireless charging.

It actually looks like the old generation iPads of you think about it. With a camera on the right side and speaker grills at the top and bottom, there’s nothing new on the design front.

The official unveiling ceremony of these devices took place in India. And like always Oppo has given its primary attention to the cameras.  Oppo F11 and Oppo F11 Pro Overview:  Going by the specs, the major difference between the Pro and the vanilla version of the device lies on the selfie cam. The vanilla version of the device comes with a selfie snapper, which rests on the water-drop style notch on the top of the display. The Pro version, on the other hand, has eliminated the notch completely and has implemented a motorized style pop-up selfie camera just like the  Vivo V15 Pro . Nonetheless, both the device features the same 16MP selfie shooter. So, the customers do not have to deal with any sort of compromises even by opting for the non-pro version.         On the back lies a dual camera setup, which is a combination of 48MP primary shooter backed by a 5MP depth sensor. Although the sensor in the primary camera is rich in terms of megapixel counts, it only produces images with 12MP resolution. It does  4-in-1 pixel binning  to achieve that property just like on the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 7  and the  Vivo V15 Pro . Oppo, this time, has also included Ultra Night Mode to enhance the low light image qualities.   As far as we know, Oppo has always integrated Artificial Intelligence in its cameras on one form or another. And this time, it’s no different. In the launch event, Oppo had proudly announced that these new devices feature 23 types of recognized scenes and color enhancement, which Oppo calls Color Mapping.  On the display front, the phones come with a 6.53-inch LTPS IPS panel in a 19.5:9 form factor. The display on both of these devices comes with Full-HD+ resolution. And as I cued already, the Oppo F11 Pro comes with an all-screen design, whereas the Oppo F11 features a tiny notch up top.  In terms of battery, both the phones boast a massive 4000mAh Li-Po battery. And to speed up the charging process, Oppo has also included VOOC Charge 3.0 charging technology. With this tech, Oppo claims that the devices will get fully juiced just in 80 minutes.  Talking about the performance, these devices are powered by  MediaTek Helio P70 chipset . The non-pro version comes with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of non-expandable storage. In the case of Oppo F11 Pro, there is 6GB RAM and 64GB of non-expandable memory. And to make the optimum and efficient utilization of the in-house resources, Oppo has also included Hyper Boost feature.

Both of these devices will go on sale in India via Amazon India starting from March 15.  These devices surely look impressive and Oppo Nepal is rigorously interested to launch these devices in Nepal. Oppo Nepal has genuinely cued its imminent launch in Nepal, it didn’t quite explicitly speak about the launch date. And neither did they tell about the probable prices. But we can expect that the Oppo F11 could cost somewhere between 36,000 – 38,000. As far as the Pro version is concerned, Oppo could price it somewhere between 45,000 to 48,000.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/oppo-f11-oppo-f11-pro.jpg']

The Chinese company took to Weibo to announce its plans to launch the new device through a short video. The video basically outlines the top lining of the phone with a focus towards the center. There will be a camera on the center of the phone, unlike the  Huawei Nova 4  which has a camera cutout on the left side of the screen.  The Huawei Nova 4e will be a member of the Nova 4 series, rather than its direct successor. It is rumored to be a cheaper sibling with a few cut downs on the features to meet its price point.  The teaser video also reveals the Huawei Nova 4e to feature a 32-megapixel selfie camera. This camera will probably sit on a water drop notch up front.        Huawei hasn’t really revealed much about the Nova 4e. However, we can expect it to make way into the international market soon. Like I mentioned before, this new device will be a little cheaper than the Nova 4.  Rumors circulating on the internet suggest the Huawei Nova 4e to feature triple cameras on the back, just like the Nova 3 along with a 3,240 mAh battery. The device will supposedly be powered by the Kirin 710 chipset. Some rumors also suggest that this Nova 4e is the P30 Lite.   Huawei launched the Nova 4 a few months ago. The phone features the HiSilicon Kirin 970 chipset along with 8 GB of RAM. The two secondary lenses on its triple camera setup work as a depth sensor and as an ultra-wide angle camera.

At that time, purchasing a SIM card used to be really cumbersome. During that time, customers had to wait for months for the openings and obliged to wait in long queues to apply for a SIM card. Even with all those efforts, sometimes the customers had to return empty-handed. And that was the time when the black marketing of the SIM cards was flourishing. This led to quite a confusion in the telecom’s database since a person used to carry a SIM registered in another person’s name. Often times, such SIM Cards were quite found used for criminal activities. So to prevent such criminal activities to happen in the future and to maintain a regulated database, NTA is on the verge of commencing some strict rules for SIM Card registration.  Read More:  Mobile Phones’ IMEI registration process in Nepal will take a while to come live  To discourage the use of SIM Cards registered in other’s name, NTA is developing an “e-KYC system”. The trend of getting multiple SIM Cards all registered in the same name has been quite trendy lately. And the NTA is against that too. Addressing the issue, NTA spokesperson Minprasad Aryal informed that the first stage of the e-KYC system has already been ready. And the Spokesperson is quite optimistic regarding the effectiveness of this new system. Although some convoluted topics have already been resolved, Aryal informed that the number of SIM cards allowed to be under a single person’s name has not yet been finalized.        “As of now, there are six telecom service providers in Nepal”, Aryal said, “and the customers can easily pick a service provider they are fond of. But there is also the rule to fill different forms to get SIM cards from different telecom service providers. To solve this cumbersome process, NTA is planning to create a central database with a digital photograph of the users and a digital fingerprint for authenticity.” Aryal also mentioned the plans to include such information in the National ID Card’s database.  Once the central database is ready, customers will have to register their fingerprint and their digital photo to purchase a SIM card. And only by comparing with the database and ascertaining the number of SIM cards already registered in the name, a SIM card would be provided. Not just for the new SIM cards, old SIM card owners will also have to re-register for the system. And the procedures involved is similar (users have to provide their fingerprint data and a digital photograph). In doing so, the NTA not just can ascertain the authenticity of the information provided on the earlier purchase but also can solve the problems related to SIM duplication.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nta-to-prevent-people-using-sim-cards-registered-in-others-name.jpg']

It will merge current speeds of a ThunderBolt 3 standard with all the flexibility of a USB. Just to put that bump in speed into context, you now stand to enjoy over 8 times more transfer speed compared to your USB 3.2 Gen 1. You can read our article  here  for all the USB generations that are currently in use, along with their features.  So, starting off with the fastest USB available in the market right now, the USB 3.2 Gen 2×2, which caps out at 20Gbps. If the USB 4 ceases to exist, it will easily reach up to 40Gbps of max transfer speeds. Not just that, you also get the ability to push out digital signals for external monitors and deliver power to charge your smartphone or a laptop. Doesn’t this sound like an all in one solution for all our connectivity needs?  Why not just use ThunderBolt 3?         Now, you might have a question in mind right now. Why not just use ThunderBolt 3 on all PCs, they already use a USB-C port to connect, don’t they? Well, let me answer my own question, TB3 was a closed standard, the specifications weren’t exactly public and it was expensive to manufacturer. That’s also one of the reasons why the adoption was pretty slow, but Intel plans to change that soon.  Also Read:  Realme 3 Announced with no ads, Helio P70, and dual back cameras  Why now?  The company promised something in 2017, to make the standard available to other chip makes. Basically, it will allow any manufacturer to implement the technology royalty-free and encourage adoption. The USB 4 was announced by the USB-IF on March 4, with the said specs, so seems like Intel is finally making good on its promise. Although, the drafted specifications will only become official when it’s published later this year.  What will USB 4 be capable of?   Ending this piece off with the specs, in case you didn’t know. You will need to use cables capable of 40Gbps speeds to enjoy all the benefits. The same is also the maximum data transfer speeds, the same as Thunderbolt 3. It will also be capable of a 100W of power output while being able to power up to two 4k displays or one 5k display. And the most hyped application of all, support for an external GPU.

Since working out with the fitness on is a fun way to maintain fitness, I was really delighted when I got this review unit. Although I wasn’t quite able to give continuity on my daily fitness, I used these headphones for more than a month now. But did I like it? Well, I am gonna answer that in this Dyplay ANC 30 headphones Review.  Design and Build  The Dyplay ANC 30 headphones feature a sturdy neckband with the wires projecting outside the neckband. The wires are long enough so it reaches the ears pretty easily. In terms of aesthetics, the headphones look nothing extraordinary. It looks similar to most of the headphones out there. But if you ask me, I was quite impressed with the earphones’ housing. It looks shiny and is appealing at the same time.         Since it is a budget headphone, the materials used on the device is mostly polycarbonate. So, it doesn’t look particularly premium. But it surely is robust. I tried to bend and twist the neckband but the device handled such abuses without any issues. During the review period, I slept with these headphones on in a couple of occasions. And you can easily see the headphone is still intact. So I am quite positive about the durability of the device even in a long run.   Also talking about the durability, this headphone also comes with an IPX4 certification, which means that it is splash resistant. So the sweat drops during jogging and the water droplets in the drizzles will not do any harm to the headphones.  Pairing and Control  The device comes with five dedicated buttons: a power button, an active noise cancellation button, play/pause button, and two volume rockers. With these buttons at its disposal, the headphone is fairly easy to use. Pressing the power button turns the device on with a vibration. When the headphone is on, you can see the Dyplay ANC 30 headphone on your laptop or smartphone in the list of available Bluetooth devices. After that, you can easily pair the headphones with your laptop or smartphone. \xa0Once it’s paired, you are good to listen to any kind of music from your audio device.  While wearing the headphones on the neck, all the buttons lie on the left. Since all the buttons are at the convenient spot, I didn’t have any problem to reach my finger to the buttons. Even while wearing this neckband, I was able to play/pause the music, adjust the audio volume and even accept or reject an incoming call easily.   Continuing with the buttons, the longest one on the button panel is the play and pause button. This button can also be used to answer or reject an incoming call. When you get a call, you can simply press the button once to receive the call. If you wish to reject, pressing and holding the button for a while will do the job. The buttons on the top and button of this button are the volume rockers. The upper one raises the volume and the lower one reduces the volume. Pressing and holding these buttons will also switch to next and previous tracks respectively.  Below the play/pause button lays a power button and a dedicated noise cancellation button. The noise cancellation button here is a slider type, which can be turned on even while listening to music. So even if there is any sort of noises in the surroundings while listening to the music, you can easily switch it on and suppress those noises. A green LED rests on the top of the NC button, which indicates whether the noise cancellation button is turned on.  Sound Performance  Talking about the sound quality, I was fairly impressed with what the headphones have to offer on the audio front. It outputs a good amount of bass. Mids and highs also sound really clean here. But some music lacks quite a depth though. But considering the price, it was understandable.   And what bugged me till the very end was the lack of aptX certification. With the absence of the aptX, I experienced degradation in audio quality at times. I also noticed a slight change in the sound quality when the distance between the audio earphones and the audio device increased. Also, the version of the Bluetooth here is 4.2 and not the latest 5.0. So I quite missed the wider range, faster transfer speed, and power efficiency of the Bluetooth 5.0. But since this is nothing big of an issue, let’s move forward with the performance.   When I listened to the songs in these headphones, I fairly liked its touch and its capability to output soothing and smooth audio. I also didn’t notice any sort of latency and distortions in high volumes. And since it is capable of noise cancellation, it is capable of silencing the surrounding noises as well. I turned the NC button quite often while walking on the busy streets. I also used it in the office to avoid background sounds and to concentrate on my works. And on both the scenarios, it did a pretty good job. Surrounding sounds were not that audible and I could enjoy the clean taste of music. But since this headphone is the in-ear type, you will not get a sophisticated noise cancellation like that of the over-ear headphones, where noise cancellation takes place through both active and passive medium.  Battery  I found the best part of the device to be its battery. This headphone comes with a sizeable 190mAh battery, which promises 12 hours of backup with the ANC turned off. As promised, the device always delivered over 11 hours of backup on my use. With the ANC turned on, the backup reduces to 8 hours though. So even with the ANC turned on or off, I was able to use it for one working day, which is really remarkable. Charging uses a Micro USB port and takes around 2 hours to get the device fully charged. 2 hours is a pretty long time to charge the headphones. But considering the size of the battery, it looks plausible. When it comes to the battery backup, it even outperformed the  MPOW Flame Bluetooth Headphones .  Verdict  Since it’s a budget headphone, I didn’t have much expectations from the device. But the device gave me a pleasant surprise with its awesome battery life, sturdy build, easy controllability, and decent noise cancellation. Although it lacks quite a punch when compared with the premium headphone, these pair does a remarkable job, especially at its price. So if you are a budget-conscious audiophile, this is one of the best headphones you can get under $60 price bracket.

['LaLiga’s superior technology and how Premier League is copying them'],[],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['March 3, 2019']",2019-03-03 13:52:50+00:00,"['LaLiga has few of the best football clubs in the world, which includes giants like Real Madrid and Barcelona. Both these teams collectively took home the last five Champions League trophies. The national team itself won the 2010 world cup tournament, so it would be an over exaggeration that Span is serious about the game. The fans are pretty heart whelming, passionate, loyal, and it’s only fair that the technology that goes into it is top notch too.\xa0And top notch it is, with so many technologies features in their games.  A well maintained constant flow of information for both the referees and viewers. The relation between technology and football has mostly received mixed reactions from fans. But most would agree that technology has made the game better, more enjoyable even, and definitely a lot fair. With so many cameras pointed at you, how do you expect to get away with anything dirty? Take a look at a few of the technology that goes into a LaLiga game, and how the premier league was “inspired” by them.  VAR (Video Assistant Referee)  This one is as simple as it gets, but it does come with its fair share of rules. For instance, it can be used in case of a goal, mistaken identity, offside and red card offense. It has been used to alter almost 59 decision till now, from a total of 2,280 incidents. The referees are given a minimum of 6 to 20 camera angles to assess the situation. These camera angles can be selected, replayed, enlarged and played frame by frame to ensure an accurate decision is made.         This technology has been in use since the 2018-19 season in LaLiga. This technology will come to the premier league later this year.  MediaCoach  LaLiga has been using this tech since 2010 and is said to be one of the major reason for Spanish football’s dominance. With the help of numerous cameras in every stadium that tracks and monitors all the players. The data is then processed into a range of statistics. It may include stuff like heat maps, distance traveled and the player’s positioning, which is then submitted to the coaching staff. This, in turn, helps them make better decisions and as a result, the player’s performance in the field improves.  LaLiga claims that no other football league has this type of tech available at their disposal. But sooner or later, we expect this to enter Premier League as well.  360-degree replay  Powered by a total of 38 4k cameras, Intel, and a “spider cam” you can access 360-degree replays. Much like the ones in FIFA’s video game, this adds up to a unique experience for the fans. As for now, a total of six stadiums in the LaLiga. They will be adding this feature to more stadiums in the coming seasons. ‘The challenge for us today is to get as close to FIFA as possible. As we have to deliver this great video-game style views that people have come to expect,’ Mr. Evers (CCO of LaLiga) added.   This technology is set to come to three premier league stadiums starting next season.  Calendar Selector/Sunlight Broadcasting Planning  Its sunlight broadcasting planner uses VR and AI to create a 3D map of every stadium. This helps them analyze sunlight, shades and glare effect on the cameras during broadcasts. On the contrary, their Calender Selector helps automatically generate schedules to optimize broadcast viewership and maximize attendance. This as a whole, helps them maximize profit and fan enjoyment. The Calendar Selector takes European cup games, domestic games, protests, and travel issues into account.  Plus unlike Premier league, LaLiga has complete control over its gaming schedules. That aided by Machine Learning and AI helps LaLiga pull an edge over its English rival.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LaLiga.jpg']

Opal International is the authorized distributor of iMars brand in Nepal. And now, five of their phones are receiving price drops, making the phones even more affordable. Here they are:  Vega X7  The Vega X7 is the best looking and the best performing of the iMars bunch! This phone, which used to cost Rs.26000 has received a huge price cut of Rs.5000, making the current price only Rs.21000! For that price, what you get is a 5.9″ Full-HD IPS display, a dual camera setup of two 13 MP cameras, and a 13 MP selfie camera as well. It is powered by a MediaTek 6757 processor and has 4 GB RAM. There’s 64 GB internal storage onboard, and a large 4500 mAh battery. The shiny looking body also features a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor.

The ViVi 8 used to cost Rs.18000, and now, the price has dropped to Rs.15,500. The ViVi 8’s design looks kinda out-dated, but it is actually okay for the most part. For a current price of Rs.15,500, it packs okay-ish specs inside it. And even for a budget phone, it does have a fingerprint scanner at the back.   iMars ViVi 8 Specifications:   Display : 5.5″ IPS LCD display with HD resolution, (720 x 1280 pixels)  Rear Camera : 13 MP  Front Camera : 8 MP  CPU : 1.8 GHz Spreadtrum 9853A  GPU : Mali T820  RAM : 4 GB  Storage : 32 GB  Software : Android 7.0 Nougat  Battery : 3200 mAh  Price : Rs. 15,500   iMars Milky Way M2  Judging by the name, you might not be wrong for thinking that the phones have strange names. But, what’s in the name anyway? This is another budget phone from iMars, that got a price drop. The Milky Way M2, which used to cost Rs.14,000 is now priced at Rs.12,500, making it very similar to the  Lenovo A5s . But for the most part, it feels like the A5s outshines this phone in most ways. Except that it has a fingerprint sensor at the back!  iMars Milky Way M2 Specifications:   Display : 5.45″ IPS LCD display with HD+ resolution (720 x 1440 pixels)  Rear Camera : Dual, 8 MP + depth sensor  Front Camera : 5 MP  CPU : 1.3 GHz Spreadtrum SC9850K  RAM : 2 GB  Storage : 16 GB  Battery : 3200 mAh  Price : Rs. 12,500   iMars Rose  iMars Rose actually packs a slightly bigger screen at 5.5 than the Milky Way M2. And even though this is a phone at entry-level pricing, it does have a fingerprint sensor at the back. And that is actually quite a handy feature, which is rarely found in entry-level smartphones. This one used to cost Rs. 12000, and is now priced at Rs.10,500.   iMars Rose Specifications:   Display:\xa0 5.5″ IPS LCD with HD resolution, (1280 x 720 pixels)  Rear Camera: \xa08 MP  Front Camera:  5 MP  CPU:  1.3 GHz Spreadtrum 9832A  GPU: \xa0Mali 400 MP2  RAM:\xa0 1 GB  OS: \xa0Android 7.0 Nougat  Storage:  16GB, microSD expandable (up to 128GB)  Battery:  2800 mAh  Price:\xa0 Rs.10,500   iMars VSUN 6  The VSUN 6 is modest of the bunch with modest specs, features and design footprint. This is for those looking for just something that works and not much. It looks and feels like an entry-level cheap phone, there’s no way around that. And this phone used to cost Rs.10000, which is now, available for Rs.8500. So, similar to the Colors phones we get.   iMars VSUN 6 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 5.0″ IPS LCD with HD resolution, (1280 x 720 pixels)  Rear Camera: \xa08 MP  Front Camera:  5 MP  Chipset:  1.3 GHz Spreadtrum SC9832A  GPU: \xa0Mali 400 MP2  RAM : 1 GB  OS: \xa0Android 7.0 Nougat  Storage:  16 GB with microSD expandable (up to 128GB)  Battery:  2200 mAh  Price:  Rs. 8500   Even after the price drops, these phones don’t seem worth it to me at all. The iMars Vega 7 comes at almost the same price as the  Galaxy M20 . The only advantage it has is the 4 GB RAM which the M20 doesn’t have. So, it can be a bit worth it, but for other phones, they don’t seem like value for money. What do you think of these?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/imars-price-drop.jpg']
['Want to get rid of smartphone addiction? This ‘dumb’ phone will help you!'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 3, 2019']",2019-03-03 10:09:53+00:00,"['With the rise of the internet and the development of social media platform like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc., the smartphone obsession has reached a new height. With these advancements, people quite tend to adhere to their smartphones connected to the internet. Although these sorts of habits have increased the scope of digital media marketing and e-commerce platforms, it has quite hindered social interaction. So to resolve this very issue, Swiss brand Punkt has designed an MPO2 mobile phone.  The Punkt MPO2 mobile phone is a dumb phone meaning it neither features the apps like Facebook and Instagram nor connects you to the internet. It is merely an electronic device, which aids its users to communicate with friends, family, and acquaintances through SMS and phone calls. Do you remember those good old days, when there used to be keypad-style mobile with features of calling and texting? Just like those retro  Nokia phones , this Punkt MPO2 mobile comes with a small screen, no apps and no ways to connect to the internet. But unlike those retro Nokia phones, this phone costs a whopping £300 ($400) on the purchase.  That looks too much for a ‘dump’ phone. But in their defense, Punkt claims that the sleek and lightweight design and some modern features of the device costs that premium amount. “Modern features” means that the phone is capable of producing high-quality audio with in-built noise cancellation, features micro-USB charging, anti-reflection screen, and an anti-fingerprint coating.        Being a modern device, the handset works with the modern sized SIM cards. And as mentioned earlier, it is extremely light when compared with the modern-day smartphones. It weighs merely 88 grams, which is way lower than the 201grammed  Samsung Galaxy Note 9 .  Furthermore, this device also let its users switch on 4G mobile broadband access. This feature allows the handset to act as a hotspot for the devices like laptops and tablets to tether to.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/punkt-mpo2-dumb-phone.jpg']
"['Nubia Phones Showdown: V18, Z17 Lite And Z17 MiniS – Still Relevant?']","['Nubia', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['March 3, 2019']",2019-03-03 08:45:09+00:00,"['Nubia is another Chinese smartphone company that made its entry to the Nepali market recently. And they entered with four phones –  Nubia V18 ,  Nubia Z17 Mini ,  Nubia Z17 Lite , and  Nubia Z17 MiniS .  Now, the company is known for its innovative products, such as the  Nubia X  – a bezel-less phone with dual screens! And besides that, they pack good specs for the price as well. Here, we review three of their phones as they belong to the 25000 – 30000 category.         Design and Build   Nubia V18  The Nubia V18 is the cheapest of the bunch,  costing Rs.25000 . For that, you do get a  metal build , but with a smooth plastic finish, that makes it appear not-metal! Due to this, it doesn’t look and feel as premium as the other two. And since this phone has a bigger screen, it stands out as the largest phone of the bunch, but at the same time, has the worst built among the three. It flexes quite a bit when bent. So, there are some build issues.      Nubia V18  Design   1  of 5               Design          Buttons right         Dedicated camera button         Headphone Jack         MicroUSB                           It has a single camera at the back and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The volume rockers and power button are on the right while there is also a dedicated camera button on the left.  Nubia Z17 Lite  This one stays true to metal. With a  metal unibody design , perfect edges and curves, this looks really good. The smooth metal finish also makes it feel good on the hands. A seamless body combined with its subtle gold accents makes it look almost perfect!      Nubia Z17 Lite  Design   1  of 3               Design         USB-C         Buttons                     Its build quality is also quite good. There are no flexes or creaks of any kind when bent or so. All buttons are on the right, and there is a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor at the back. But it does not have a headphone jack!  Nubia Z17 MiniS  This one is in a league of its own. It has a  glass back with metal frame , and the fine finish makes it feel very premium on the hands. The gold accent on the frame makes it look all the better, but the glass attracts some finger smudges and such, and at the same time might not be able to withstand drops or impacts.      Nubia Z17 MiniS  Design   1  of 3               Design         Buttons         USB-C                     Its buttons are on the right as well, and the back only houses the dual camera setup. The fingerprint sensor is on the front embedded on the home button itself. Also, this one shows a bit of flex and creaks when bent, but I guess, that’s normal for a glass phone. This, too, misses out on the headphone jack.  Overall, the Z17 MiniS looks the best, while the Z17 Lite wins in build quality. But the V18 has the advantage of having a  3.5 mm headphone jack  over these two.  Display  In terms of display, all of these features  IPS LCD panels , but they differ in size and in quality.  Nubia V18   The V18 gets a large  6.0″ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio . It features a  Full HD+ resolution  but with its larger display, it fails to compete with the other two in terms of quality, maybe due to it’s lesser pixel density. It’s not that bad, because it still is a Full HD, which some phones still don’t give you for the price.  Nubia Z17 Lite   The Z17 Lite features a  5.5″ display with Full HD resolution  in a smaller  16:9 aspect ratio . But besides the smaller aspect ratio, everything else about the display is pretty good. It has decent color accuracy, a fair amount of brightness, and non-existent bezels at the side. Looking at the display on this one, it feels like this kind of display is more than okay, we don’t really need bezel-less displays with a notch or what not.  Nubia Z17 MiniS   The Z17 MiniS has the  smallest screen at 5.0″ . But since it does pack the same  Full HD resolution , it gets better pixel density, and so, has the best display quality among the three. The colors on it are punchy, without being oversaturated, and the brightness is ample to use outdoors as well. This is simply a great display, and so, I don’t mind even if it is small.  The Z17 Lite and the Z17 MiniS are from 2017, so, these phones still feature a 16:9 aspect ratio. But even so, they look pretty good to me.  Cameras  Nubia V18      V18 Camera   1  of 2               Rear Camera         Front Camera                  The Nubia V18 packs a  single 13 MP camera  at the back and an  8 MP camera at the front . And to say the most, the rear camera is better than your average camera, I mean, more than you’d expect from a phone like this. It has good color reproduction and okay dynamic range.

The images don’t come out sharp enough. There are less details, are muddy, and the white balance seems to be off. The dynamic range on it is also not great, photos can come out soft, and it has some focus issues as well. Also, sometimes, it appears that the photos have been beautified.  Nubia Z17 Lite      Z17 Lite Camera   1  of 2               Rear Camera         Front Camera                  The Z17 Lite packs a  13 MP primary camera accompanied by a 2 MP depth sensor  at the back. And the photos on this one are pretty good! Pictures come out sharp and detailed. There’s a lot of clarity in the images, the color reproduction is nice, and the dynamic range is also fantastic! Overall, the photos look very rich, both in colors and details. The portrait images are also good enough but seem to lack a bit of “something” than the normal images.

And that makes for quite the details in your selfies. The colors are there, but the white balance seems slightly off. Portrait images are great…the edge detection and background blurring are pretty balanced.

And the camera is the best among the three. Color tones are rich, the white balance is on point, images are vibrant. Actually, the images are more or less, similar to the Z17 Lite, but I don’t know, it looks very slightly better.

The details are good, sharpness is also okay and the color reproduction is excellent. And since it has a depth sensor in the front too, it can capture some really great bokeh images!  Performance  The performance across all the three phones are decent, to say the least.  Nubia V18  The V18 features a  Snapdragon 625 processor , which seems a bit underpowered for a phone that costs Rs.25000. It has  4 GB of RAM , which can handle normal day-to-day tasks easily. You can also play PUBG at low settings without many noticeable stutters. But it does not have any kind of heating issue even after long hours of gaming sessions.  Nubia Z17 Lite and Z17 MiniS  Both these phones feature the  Snapdragon 653 processor  and a  6 GB of RAM . They perform as expected, with smooth transitions between screens, and multi-tasking. For daily usage, the phones run smooth, without the slightest bit of stutters. As for gaming, you can play PUBG on both at medium settings. But these have a bit of heating issue during long gaming sessions. Nothing alarming, but just something to mention.  Software and UI  The Nubia  V18 comes with Android 7.1.2 stock Android One UI , so, everything is pretty basic on that front. It does have its fair share of bloatware even though it’s stock Android, but, they are of a minimal amount, so, it’s okay. The UI is as smooth too, so, no problems on that front, either.  The Lite and MiniS run on  Android 7.1.1 with Nubia UI 5.0 . They don’t feel that bad, though. The only thing I can complain about here is the shape or layout of the icons which look too flashy!  Battery  In terms of battery, the Nubia V18 is the best. It has a  big 4000 mAh battery  and with  Android One UI , battery optimization seems good. It can give you 6 hours of screen on time with mixed usage. The only problem is that it still comes with a  micro USB port   without any fast charging . So, it takes about 3 hours to fully charge.  The Lite and MiniS both come with  3200 mAh battery , and they give out about 4.5 hours of screen on time. These, too, however, have  18-Watt Fast Charging and USB-C , so, charge fully in under 2 hours!  Conclusion and Verdict  To sum up, Nubia V18 is a bit difficult to recommend. Because for a price of Rs.25000, it’s got quite uninspiring materials. There’s only a single camera, with the selfie camera not being that good. Plus, the performance is also not something you can talk about. The battery life on it is good, but, if you add some cash, you can get one of the other two, which are a lot better!  The Z17 Lite has the best build quality among the three – no creaks, no flexes! It also looks premium, but not to the level of the Z17 MiniS. But, the non-existent side bezels look really really appealing! So, for a price of Rs.26,500, this seems like a good buy.  The Z17 MiniS has a proper glass build, making it the most premium of the three devices. It gets 4 cameras too, which take some great pictures. Of course, the display is only 5.2″, but I don’t really mind that…for the look and the feel of the phone. At Rs.28000, this can be the one to go for if you’re looking for a premium phone under Rs.30000.  Overall, there are quite a few options available in the price range of Rs.25000 – Rs.30000. But the premium look and feel offered by these devices, especially the Z17 Lite and Z17 MiniS seem unmatched. And so, even though these are older phones, they’re still quite relevant today.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/nubia-v18-vs-nubia-z17-lite-vs-nubia-z17s.jpg']

Following the footsteps of it’s Pro version, this one doesn’t just exclude features but adds some too. As for pricing and availability, they are yet to be announced.

The added feature list includes a  fingerprint scanner  at the back which gets an optional leather finish. It’s mostly personal preference, some like it, I don’t. Either way, the device is available in three color options which include the Midnight Black, Sapphire Blue, and Amber Brown. If you want the faux leather, Amber Brown is the only way to go.         The next and last difference between the Pro and non-pro model is the RAM size. The Y6 2019 gets just  2GB  of RAM, while it’s superior holds a gig more. Other than that, everything remains the same, including the storage size at  32GB . You also get the option to expand the storage by up to  512GB  via a microSD card.

How fast you ask? 20Gbps fast, that’s half of what Thunderbolt 3 can achieve, and that thing is known to support eGPUs. Although this time, the USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 uses two lanes to achieve those speeds. Also, with the growing popularity of USB C ports on the rise, this seems like a good time for a new standard to pop up. And we will explain the naming mess as well.  The new USB 3.2 Gen 2×2  20Gbps is no joke here, that’s double the speed of its direct predecessor and four times the speeds of the original USB Gen 3.0. They have implemented a 2 lane system, hence the name “2×2”. The platform was announced back in 2017, is now official, and that’s about it here. There is nothing new to share about the actual technology right now, the adaptation will start soon enough, so let’s start with the naming confusion everyone has.  The naming confusion  A brief history first, starting with the USB 1.1 (revision to the USB 1.0), which had a max speed of 12Mb/s. The second generation aka USB 2.0 was capable of 480Mb/s and that was a proper generation gap. Followed by USB 3.0, with its 5Gb/s max transfer rates. It was then revised to USB 3.1 and that doubled the transfer rate to 10Gb/s. Finally comes the one we are discussing today, with a max transfer rate of 20Gb/s, USB Gen 3.2 Gen 2×2.        The branding change  It is pretty simple, right? Well, it was for the most part. But to avoid confusion, the USB IF has now changed a few branding names from the past. The USB 3.0, a name we are all familiar with is officially the USB 3.2 Gen 1. Everything remains the same but the branding, and it also gets the SuperSpeed badging. The second in line is USB 3.1, also known as the USB 3.1 Gen 2, is now USB 3.2 Gen 2. Let’s put all this in a table to make it simpler.     USB Version  Official New Branding Name\xa0  Speed  Badging    USB 1.1  Remains Unchanged  12Mb/s  Full Speed    USB 2.0  Remains unchanged  480Mb/s  High Speed    USB 3.0  USB 3.2 Gen 1  5Gb/s  SuperSpeed    USB 3.1  USB 3.2 Gen 2  10Gb/s  SuperSpeed 10Gbps    USB 3.2  USB 3.2 Gen 2×2  20Gb/s  SuperSpeed 20Gbps     Conclusion  Hopefully, this clears your confusion. Ohh!! and these namings schemes, for eg the USB 3.2 Gen 1 only show off its theoretical speed, not the connection type or the power delivery capabilities. As explained by the USB-IF themselves, “USB 3.2  is not  USB Type-C, USB Standard-A, Micro-USB, or any other USB cable or connector”. That statement was followed by “USB 3.2\xa0 is not  USB Power Delivery or USB Battery Charging”.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/USB-3.2-Gen-2x2.jpg']

The A10 is a budget phone, but with a SuperAMOLED display. Up front, you get a notch, a V-shaped one. The display is at 6.2-inches with HD+ resolution and is called an ‘Infinity V display’. The phone, however, does not have a fingerprint sensor. The phone will be available in Blue, Black, and Red colors.         The performance is backed by the Exynos 7884 chipset, which is a very rare one as even Samsung has not used it on many devices. It is an octa-core chipset two of them performing on Cortex-A-73 cores at 1.35 GHz and six of them Cortex-A53 units, at the same frequency.

['Samsung Galaxy S10 won’t work on a tempered glass but works on a screen protector'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 27, 2019']",2019-02-27 12:07:19+00:00,"['Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus  display have created quite a lot of buzz. A dynamic Super AMOLED display with a whopping 1200 nits of brightness was unprecedented in the smartphone world. And the adoption of hole punch display to ditch the notch and to increase the screen-to-body ratio also impressed many. But the Ultrasonic under-display fingerprint scanner on the phone was the tech that got a major amount of attention. It’s the first smartphone to incorporate the technology. The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus in-display fingerprint sensor is also by far one of the fast and accurate scanners. But many of us were wondering if the fingerprint scanner would unlock the device with the dirty and wet fingers and with the screen protectors. And to answer the question, Marques Brownlee aka MKBHD performed the test and we finally got the answer.  Before diving straight into the test results, let me elaborate the working process of the Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus.  How Ultrasonic fingerprint scanners work?  We have already seen under-display fingerprint scanners on various devices.  Vivo V11 Pro ,  OnePlus 6T , and  Huawei Mate 20 Pro  are a few among the many. All these smartphones used the optical fingerprint scanner, which basically captures 2D images of the finger and unlocks the device accordingly. But the working on Ultrasonic fingerprint scanners is entirely different.         The scanner setup basically consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter of the scanner projects a very high frequency ultrasonic sound. The frequency of the ultrasonic sound is so high that the human ears cannot hear it. When the scanner projects the sound, it will strike the user’s fingerprint when placed on the top of it. Some portion of the ultrasonic waves gets absorbed and some of them get bounced back. The wave that has been bounced back is addressed by the receiver. When the receiver receives the bounced back waves, the scanner does a 3D mapping of the fingerprint registering all the ridges, pores and other details of the finger.  When Qualcomm announced its 3D in-display ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, it mentioned that there will a 250 milliseconds (or 0.25 second) of latency while unlocking the device. The time required is roughly similar to the speed of the conventional capacitive fingerprint scanners. Qualcomm also announced that the error rate on this piece of tech will be 1 percent or less, which is comparable to all the conventional type of fingerprint scanners.  Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus in-display fingerprint scanner test  Firstly MKBHD tested the speed of the scanner comparing side by side with the OnePlus 6T. On doing so, the phone unlocked tad bit faster than the OnePlus 6T. In addition to faster speed, the advantage on the S10 Plus was that user also don’t have to place their finger on the top of the scanner until the device gets unlocked. In the smartphones like OnePlus 6T and Mate 20 Pro, users need to keep their finger on the top of the display for quite sometime, which can get annoying at times.   MKBHD also tested the accuracy of the scanner with his wet hands. In that test, the optical fingerprint scanner on OnePlus 6T failed to identify the finger, whereas the Ultrasonic scanner on the S10 Plus identified and unlocked the device without any issues.  Lastly, he tested the device with a screen protector on the device. And the device get unlocked without any issues. Pleased be noted that the screen protector was not placed that well and there were a fair number of air gaps. Nonetheless, the device unlocked abruptly. However, on placing a tempered glass, the device failed to register the finger. So, that means, we should use a tempered glass with a hole on the place of fingerprint sensor? We don’t know that yet.  MKBHD registered his finger by without applying the tempered glass. So when he placed his finger on the screen after putting on the tempered glass, the 3D mapping done by the scanner might have been inaccurate. On placing the tempered glass, the distance between the scanner and the finger increases, due to which the 3D mapping might have been altered. That could be the reason for the device to remain locked at that moment.  But that’s just a guess. Since we don’t have the phone on our hands, we are unable to speak anything solid on the subject yet. But when we get the device, we will surely try that and answer it out on our full review. If you are curious to know how will the device fare in that,  subscribe to our YouTube channel  and stay tuned for our Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus full review.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-S10.jpg']

As for the branding seen on the device, its codenamed “Vogue” which will reportedly be renamed “ Leica ” on the final product. And by the looks of it, the design is somewhat closer to the Mate 20 Pro keeping the aesthetics of the  P20  intact.  Earlier, the leaks suggested that the device may be coming with a quad- camera setup at the rear, but the leaked images show a different story.

First, with its 48 MP camera hardware with  pixel binning . Then, we found the camera was  not as good as the Redmi Note 5 AI , actually. And then, the  Redmi Note 7 Bendgate ! After that, we found out the Redmi Note 7  was a bit unwilling to bend . So many issues, so much buzz, so much controversy around that device!  The first bend gate was pointed out by  Technical Guruji , one of the most popular tech reviewers of India. He tested the phone for durability and bent it easily. But while doing so, he didn’t seem to apply even pressure at the central point of the phone, which was seemingly unscientific, resulting in the breakage. And for that, the guy received a lot of heat.         Then, another video surfaced about the phone.  Gupta Information Systems , which is another popular tech channel, took the phone for a spin with bend test, scratch test, durability test, splash test and such. And the phone passed the bend test, albeit bending a bit, but returning to its original state. Due to it going through all those extra steps and a more scientific approach, it seemed like a more genuine of a bend test.   But now, we have the mother of all tests!  JerryRigEverything , which is one of the most popular channels in the world to test the durability of tech, rigged the Redmi Note 7. And it almost survived… In his tests, he goes through all his normal procedures, where the phone fares like most others do. But on the bend test, the phone bends easily. And there is no questioning his techniques! The phone bends, there are no two ways around it! Maybe, the weakness lies in the plastic frame of the phone, but it’s out there for everyone to see.   Yes, you might argue that Zach, of JerryRigEverthing, is a pretty muscular guy, and he can bend phones more easily than others, too. But of course, that also proves the phone will withstand your day to day abuses. No one will be bending their phones like that anyway, which he states himself. Yet, this phone didn’t survive, when most others do. And so, now, we can rest…the conflict has come to an end…we have the result. The Redmi Note 7 – so it bends!  Now, we don’t mean to bash someone and praise some other. This is about the phone, and we’re just making you aware of what’s going on. If we had the phone in our hands, maybe, we’d bend-test it ourselves.

The enhanced HDR function is called Chrome Boost. And evidently it’s doing an excellent job in the shadow areas and details of the pictures against rivals Galaxy M20 and Redmi Note 7.  Also, the company has added a nightscape mode, which in simple language is a handheld night mode for taking better images in low light conditions without making use of a tripod.

The camera had a whopping 16 lenses and all of them were packed in a very compact body. That’s not all, the device back then was also capable of capturing images like top-tier  DSLRs . And for the very reason, the device also received an award for its exceptional computational imaging and the cost-effective multi-camera imaging prowess. Some of the popular tech reviewers also saw the device as a replacement to bulky cameras.  After that, we did not hear much from that imaging company. But recently, when Nokia released the  Nokia 9 PureView  at an event in  MWC 2019 , the name of the company came into the light once again. Nokia 9 PureView create a buzz in the MWC because of the Penta camera setup at its back. And since Light was the one, who developed it, the company also received fair of attention and appreciation. All thanks to its sophisticated computational software and intelligent processing power.  Addressing the proficiency of the Light Company in computational imaging, different companies are reaching out to Light for collaboration. The company recently announced a partnership with Sony. When that’s still fresh news, Light further announced the partnership with the Chinese internet company Xiaomi. With this partnership, Xiaomi is positive on bringing multi-camera devices with Light and enabling them with DSLR-level capabilities.        “We are thrilled to partner with Light to leverage their advanced imaging solutions for our future devices,” said Zhu Dan, VP, smartphone division, GM of camera department, Xiaomi. “Xiaomi works tirelessly to remain at the forefront of smartphone innovation, and perfecting smartphone photography is a key focus for us. We are excited to work on devices using Light’s technology so our users can produce even more amazing photos.”  We saw multi-camera setups on various smartphones. Triple camera on  Samsung Galaxy S10, S10+ ,  Huawei Mate 20 Pro , etc. and quad-camera setup on  Samsung Galaxy A9 2018  are the few examples. All these smartphones used lenses with different focal lengths. However, the Penta-camera setup on recently announced Nokia 9 PureView has used five different lenses all with the same focal length. So we are yet to see, how the Xiaomi-Light smartphone will turn out to be. Will it focus on image quality, versatility or both? I guess, we should probably have to wait for the official launch of the smartphone to get the answer.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/xiaomi-light-partnership.jpg']

Alcatel 1S:  Alcatel 1S is the most affordable among all in the list that features a plastic build and is a bit more compact. The device stands at 5.5- inches with HD resolution and 18: aspect ratio.         As far as the performance is concerned, the device is powered by a Spreadturm SC9863 Octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage.

Aesthetics- wise, we’re looking at a 5.94-inch HD+ display with 19.5:9 aspect ratio. And this tie, the device has a tiny notch on top for the selfie camera. Speaking of which, the selfie camera is an 8 MP sensor and at the back, we see dual cameras like the 1s but different in Megapixel counts.   The back houses two cameras, one with 13 MP RGB sensor and another, a depth sensor with a megapixel count of 5MP. So, with those cameras, you get features like Bokeh effect and AI scene detection. Additionally, there is Google Lens support included.  However, the 3L disappoints with only having Android 8.1 Oreo, whereas the more inexpensive 1S has Android Pie. However, the company says, the device will get Android Pie in Q2 of this year. Additionally, the phone also has Facial Recognition.

Not only the design is similar, but other things are similar to the 3L like, the design, display and camera setup. However, this one has a slightly powerful Snapdragon 439 processor with two memory configuration options, 3GB/32GB or 4GB/64GB.

It’s a tablet standing at 10 inches of 800x 1280 pixels IPS display. The “3” in the name is for Tablet and the “10” signifies the 10- inch display. That is not the interesting part, however. The intriguing part is that fact that the table has a sort of smart display. This one features a far-field recognition of up to 3 meters, meaning you can trigger Google Assistant hands-free.   Other than that, the 3T has an unspecified processor with 2GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory with support for external memory expansion. Camera -wise, there is an unimpressive 2 MP front camera and rear camera.  Battery capacity is a huge 4,080 mAh which is considerable for such a huge display. Also, the device comes with Android 9.0 Pie out of the box, which is a good thing.  Although the specs are not as impressive to lure a lot of audiences, it can be a good deal for people wanting a tablet that functions as a smart display/ speaker of sorts. In order to enhance audio experience, the company has added an additional audio dock that includes two 5W speakers and double bass enhancement units for distortion-free sound.

"['MWC 2019: Nubia Alpha is a foldable smartwatch, which doubles as a flexible smartphone']","['MWC 2019', 'Nubia', 'ZTE']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 26, 2019']",2019-02-26 09:44:19+00:00,"['We saw quite a lot from  Samsung’s Galaxy Fold  and  Huawei’s Mate X  foldable smartphones. It was obvious to see such innovative products from such big players in the smartphone arena. But the story of the foldable device does not actually end there. Alongside the Mate X, Nubia also launched the Nubia Alpha foldable smartwatch at a grand event in  MWC 2019 . Written as  Nubia α , this foldable smartphone also doubles as a flexible smartphone.   Nubia Alpha flexible Smartwatch overview  The concept of foldable looks truly fascinating. The idea of using a mobile device to view contents into a large screen with a privilege to bend and carry it around the pocket is surely amazing. To achieve more or less the same amount of versatility, ZTE’s subsidiary brand this time launched a Nubia α smartwatch.        The display on the smartwatch comes in a tall and narrow form factor. A 4.0-inch Super AMOLED panel has been used on the device, which comes with 960 x 192 pixels resolution at 45:9 aspect ratio. To develop a foldable display for the smartwatch is not an easy job. So Nubia collaborated with Visionox, which happens to be a specialist in the flexible display business. Alongside the flexible display, the wearable also comes with water and dust proof body. It has also received an IP67 certification for that.   Apart from the flexible screen, the phone has got Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset, which is rather dated. The chipset has already been replaced by Wear 3100 chipset last year. The device also comes with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of onboard memory. As far as battery is concerned, the wearable is fueled by a 5000mAh battery. And according to the company, the battery will keep the device alive for a day or two on a single charge. Adding to the hardware is a 5MP camera, which can be handy while doing some video calls and for taking selfies.  Being a smart wearable, the smartwatch also comes with a fitness tracker to monitor the heart rate, sleep cycle and exercise patterns. And these features are accessible from Nubia’s custom OS, which goes by the name of Android Wear OS 2.1. Furthermore, the OS also supports voice commands, multi-touch feature, and some finicky air gestures just like what we saw on the  LG’s new flagship devices .   “All of your information is perfectly organized and within reach. Infinitely customizable, intuitive, and visually striking, our new wearable OS is a whole new way to interact with what you care about most,” the company boasted in a press release.  On the connectivity side, this smart device comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi. There is also the 4G LTE connectivity option on one variant with which users can use the device as a smartphone. However, only an electronic SIM (or eSIM) can be used in the device.  Nubia Alpha Flexible Smartwatch Specifications:   Display : 4.0-inch Super AMOLED panel  Resolution : 192 x 960 pixels @ 45:9 aspect ratio, 245 PPI pixel density  Dust and Water resistant :\xa0Yes; IP67 certified  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100  CPU : Quad-core 1.1 GHz Cortex-A7  GPU:  Adreno 304  OS : Android Wear 2.1  RAM : 1GB  Storage : 8GB  Camera : Single 5MP, f/2.0 camera on the front  Connectivity:\xa0 Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi b/g/n  Battery : 500mAh  Sensors : Accelerometer, gyro, heart rate, compass   Nubia Alpha Flexible smartwatch Price & Availability  Nubia has differentiated its smartwatch as the Bluetooth and LTE variant. The Bluetooth variant of the device will be available for purchase in April and will cost €450 on the purchase. The Bluetooth variant of the device will only come in a Black color variant. The LTE or eSIM variant will cost €550 for the regular. The Gold version of the device will demand a price of €650.  The LTE variant will be available through China Unicom starting from April of 2019. And this eSIM variant will land in Europe in the Q3 of 2019 eventually in North America in Q4 of 2019. But as far as Nepal is concerned, the device may not launch here at all.

I mean, the older model wasn’t actually bad, to begin with. Maybe Huawei didn’t feel the need for any major changes, at least for this year. They also launched the MateBook 14, which is more of a value for money proposition.  MateBook X Pro (2019)  Visually, the laptop is basically the same, except for the words “Huawei” replacing the logo on the lid. The display shares the same story, a 13.9-inch 3000x2000px touch panel that covers 100% of the sRGB color spectrum with a maximum brightness of 450 nits. The display is almost fully bezel-less, as the webcam’s placement remains unchanged.  Also Read:  Xiaomi MI Mix 3 5G is an incredibly cheap 5G smartphone        The CPU has been updated to Whiskey lake chips which now includes the i5-8265U or the i7-8565U. The GPU also gets a minor upgrade, flaunting the newer MX250, which itself was announced just a week ago. Thunderbolt 3 support is included, so external GPUs are usable if you are into that stuff. RAM sizes include either 8GB or 16GB LPDDR3 2133MHz while the storage selection starts at 256GB and ends at 1TB.   The laptop weighs just 2.93 pounds, is 14.6mm thick, has a 57.4Wh battery, and is available in two colors; Space Grey and Mystic Silver. So, all that’s left is the pricing, and that comes in at  €1599  for the i5 version with 8GB RAM, 512GB storage and MX250 GPU. The second option is to opt for the i7 with 16GB of RAM, 1TB storage and the MX250 for  €1999 .  MateBook 14  We already saw the  MateBook 13  back in CES. Adding to the lineup is the MateBook 14, with a 2160x1440px 14″ touch display and a similar CPU, GPU & RAM setup as the MateBook X Pro. It also gets a 57.4Wh battery with a claimed 10.5 hours of web browsing and 15 hours of video playback.   MateBook 14 does compromise a little on the build and design side, where the MateBook X Pro spares no expense. This is also one of the reasons why MateBook 14 is a bit cheaper at  €1199  for the i5 with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The i7 version with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage will cost you  €1499 . Both come with MX250 GPU as standard.

At the event, the company showcased a concept device, along with a bunch of other dummy designs. The phone on display featured a 7.2-inch QHD+ AMOLED display with four rear cameras. All phones (including the dummies) were behind glass, and they didn’t allow anyone to actually play around with it.  On the contrary, they did reveal a few interesting details about their flexible devices, a more noticeable subject was their DragonHinge technology.\xa0TCL specifically said, “not in a race to be the first” in context to the foldable smartphones. This means we won’t be seeing a retail unit from the company anytime soon. They want to get it right, take time to deal with the challenges of foldable smartphones.  An affordable foldable smartphone?  The company along with its partners also wants to make sure the software and hardware go hand in hand for a better meaningful end-user experience. On top of all this, the company also wants its foldable smartphone to fall under the “affordable price point” category.\xa0Following the statement, the company added, the cost of manufacturing a foldable smartphone doesn’t nearly cost $2000.         The price tag comes in co-relation to Samsung’s newest foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Fold which also costs $2000. I wonder what their thoughts are on the Huawei Mate X. Pricing aside if you are still wondering what TCL exactly is, they are an electronics company that manufactures everything from Televisions to Air Conditioners. As for their smartphone business, they are responsible for Alcatel and Blackberry.  When and How?  TCL has also confirmed their iteration of a foldable smartphone will make its way to retail stores sometime around 2020. There are a few ways they are going to make this possible. The first part is the production of flexible displays, which will be done by CSOT, a TCL sister company. Now they don’t have to rely on Samsungs and LGs for display panels while keeping the costs down.  The second part is the folding hinge, and this is where the DragonHinge technology comes to play. It’s basically a patient name created for its flexible displays, so there isn’t much here. And finally the software, which the company says is working on a solution, making it more intuitive. Yet, it remains to be seen what TCL comes up with next year, and if their first foldable smartphone lies in an “affordable price point”.

"['MWC 2019: LG V50 ThinQ 5G, G8, and G8s launched with Hand ID and Air Motion Gestures']","['LG', 'MWC 2019']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 25, 2019']",2019-02-25 11:30:09+00:00,"['A few days back, South Korean tech company Samsung awe-inspired the world with its  new flagship devices . And it did not take long for another South Korean smartphone maker to unveil its products. Yes, you guessed it right. LG also hit the MWC 2019’s big stage with its three new smartphones. Namely known as the LG V50 ThinQ 5G, G8 ThinQ, and G8s ThinQ, these smartphones come with LG’s new quirky Hand ID and Air Motion Gesture features.  LG V50 ThinQ 5G  The LG V50 ThinQ 5G is the company’s first take in the 5G ecosystem. Since the smartphone manufacturers are releasing a 5G phone every other day, LG also went on with the flow and dropped a flagship device embedded with a 5G modem. The phone is powered by Snapdragon 855 chipset and has been enriched with Qualcomm X50 modem to unleash its 5G potentials. On the storage front, the phone’s got 6GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard memory with a dedicated SD card for memory expansion.         On the design side, it looks blatantly similar to the last year’s  LG V40 ThinQ . The phone is encased with Corning Gorilla on the front and back and comes encapsulated with an aluminum frame. It also comes with a 6.4-inch QHD+ OLED display. The display here is an HDR 10 compliant. So we can expect an amazing dynamic range of colors on the screen. But what doesn’t look cool about the display is a wide notch up top. While most of the other smartphone manufacturers are playing with the waterdrop style notches and punch hole display, LG followed last year’s bandwagon and implemented a wide notch on the top. And this doesn’t look so fascinating in 2019.   The notch has been home to two selfie cameras – an 8MP primary shooter and a 5MP wide-angle one. The setup was present on the V40 ThinQ as well. And talking about the cameras on the back, the phone is showered with three cameras of various focal lengths. The primary one is a 12MP, 27mm, f/1.5 wide-camera, which comes equipped with a 3-axis OIS. There is also a 12MP telephoto shooter, which comes with f/2.4 lens and OIS. The telephoto camera on this device is capable of capturing images with 2x lossless optical zooming. A 16MP ultra-wide-angle camera completes the triple camera setup on the device. The ultra-wide-angle camera stretches the field of view and users can accommodate more portion of the subject into the images.  Like the last year’s device, the LG V50 ThinQ 5G also comes 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC, so it may please a fair number of audiophiles. Plus, there is a big 4000mAh to provide long-lasting backup.   Recently, we are seeing many smartphone brands bringing out foldable devices. But LG decided to skip that concept for a while. but as an answer to the trend, LG rather brought a dual screen accessory. The accessory is basically a case with a 6.2-inch secondary OLED display with Full-HD+ (1080 x 2160 pixels) resolution. The second screen comes alive when the pogo pins on the smartphone’s back connect with the accessory. The Dual Screen can come handy for multitasking and gaming. You can use the phone as a controller and the display on the accessory as the screen to view the contents. With these features, the device gives a vibe of the foldable smartphone of sorts.  LG G8s ThinQ and LG G8 ThinQ  Alongside the V50 ThinQ, LG also unveiled the LG G8s ThinQ and LG G8 ThinQ. Both of these smartphones feature the flagship Snapdragon 855 chipset and comes aboard with 6GB RAM. And as cued by their names, these smartphones do not come with the 5G capabilities.  LG G8s ThinQ  In terms of display, the G8 ThinQ rocks with a 6.1-inch QHD+ OLED display whereas the G8s has got a 6.2-inch Full-HD+ OLED panel. In terms of power, a 3500mAh non-removable battery fuels the G8 ThinQ whereas it’s a block of 3550mAh battery on the G8 ThinQ.   On the optics front, the LG G8 ThinQ flaunts a 12MP standard + 12MP telephone + 16MP ultra-wide setup just like on the V50 ThinQ. However, there is a slightly different setup on the G8s ThinQ. The G8s ThinQ features a triple camera setup with 12MP standard + 12MP telephone + 16MP ultra-wide combo.  But the triple camera setup on the G8 ThinQ is location specific. In some regions, the handset ships with only two cameras on the back.  LG G8 ThinQ  Talking about the selfie camera, the phone comes with an 8MP standard selfie camera accompanied by a ToF (Time of Flight) 3D camera. In addition to gathering depth information while capturing portrait selfies, the ToF camera also authenticates the Hand ID of the users. It reads and acknowledges the thickness and characteristics of the veins in the palm of the users and unlocks the device accordingly. The 3D ToF camera also does 3D mapping of the face to enhance the security strength of Face Unlock feature. So it cannot be fooled with 2D photos to unlock the device.  Apart from that, users will also be able to control the phone through air gestures also known as Air Motion gestures. With this feature, users can wave a hand or pinch the air to take calls, to increase and decrease volume. This feature can also be used to take screenshots without even touching the screen.  Price & Availability of LG V50 ThinQ, LG G8s ThinQ & LG G8 ThinQ  In the launch event, LG didn’t reveal anything about the pricing. And no words were spoken about its availability. But we can expect the device any time on the Q2 of 2019.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/lg-v50-thinq-5g-g8-thinq-g8s-thinq.jpg']

The smartphone-cum-table looks as refined as Samsung’s foldable device but will run for over $600 more than its competitor.  While the Samsung Galaxy Fold has dual displays, the Huawei Mate X boasts a single display that folds on the outside to give it a more smartphone-ish look. This display, when unfolded, measures 8-inch. In folded position, the front-facing screen is 6.6-inch tall while the rear screen is 6.38-inch.  The Mate X comes with a strip on the back which houses the camera setup of the device. Huawei has added in a “wing” that, according to the company, will help in the better holding and handling of the device. And unlike the Galaxy Fold’s hinge which is a little curved when laid out flat, this device comes with a hinge that is even.         The Huawei Mate X has a bezel-less display and it certainly looks a tad bit attractive than Galaxy Fold’s side-notched display. This device’s screen is made up of a polymer as glass can’t be bent in such a way. This is a disappointment considering the price tag it has, but still, this is the first generation of foldable smartphone, and it will take a bit of time before manufacturers add glass that can actually bend time and again.  In terms of optics, the device that Huawei showed off has triple cameras. However, according to Huawei’s consumer CEO Richard Yu, the Mate X will pack four cameras during the launch of the P30 series.   Another major USP of this device is that it supports 5G connectivity. Samsung has already stated that it will be launching both the 4G and 5G variants of the Galaxy Fold, so, if you opt for the Mate X, you will have to get the 5G-enabled version. Under the hood, the Huawei Mate X is powered by the company’s own  HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset  that is coupled with 8 GB of RAM and 512 GB of internal memory.  The Huawei Mate X is backed by a large 4,500 mAh battery which is certainly a good addition considering it has to power a large display, that can be used in three forms. To charge up this large battery, the Chinese company has introduced a 55W charger that can apparently charge 85% of the battery in just 30 minutes.  Huawei Mate X vs Samsung Galaxy Fold Specifications      Huawei Mate X  Samsung Galaxy Fold    Display  8-inch OLED (6.6-inch + 6.3-inch) display, 2480 x 2200 pixels  4.6-inch Super AMOLED, 7.3-inch QXGA+ Dynamic AMOLED    Chipset  HiSilicon Kirin 980  Qualcomm Snapdragon 855    RAM  8  12    Operating System  EMUI  Android v9.0 with One UI as skin    Storage  512 GB  512 GB    Front Camera  Unspecified  Dual; 10 MP + 8 MP 3D depth    Rear Camera  Quad cameras  16 MP ultra-wide + 12 MP wide + 12 MP telephoto    Battery  4,500 mAh with 55W fast charging  4,380 mAh with fast charging     Huawei Mate X Pricing and Availability  According to Huawei, the Mate X will start shipping in selected regions starting June or July. This is a thoughtful step as 5G is yet to make its way to the consumers. The Huawei Mate X will go on sale for €2,299 which is roughly $2,600. The Samsung Galaxy Fold will go on sale for $1,980.

The phone packs an awe-inspiring five cameras at the back. And is the first smartphone to do so. But that’s not all about Nokia in the grand Mobile World Congress event, the smartphone maker also unveiled four other mobile devices. Among the bunch, the Nokia 4.2, Nokia 3.2, and the Nokia 1 Plus are the budget-centric smartphones whereas the Nokia 210 is a bar phone.  Nokia 210  At the unveiling event, Nokia claims to be the world’s top feature phone maker. Being the leader in the feature phone department, Nokia has yet again dropped a feature phone to expand its lineup.         And talking about the Nokia 210 feature phone, the handset looks quite sturdy in its toughened plastic attire. The phone packs a 2.4-inch QVGA color display with a clicky number pad beneath it. With the small QVGA display and a numpad, the phone looks antiquated. But unlike most of the retro phones, the Nokia 210 houses a 0.3MP rear camera at its back. The camera on the back is accompanied by an LED flash.   On the software side, the phone boots on Nokia’s S30 software. The phone also comes pre-installed with apps like Opera Mini, Browser, Facebook, and the Snake game. On the top, the phone also comes with Mobile Store for app downloads. But the sad part is the phone only comes with 16MB of internal memory, which is non-expandable.

The phone comes with a 5.45-inch display, which is taller than the last year’s Nokia 1. Although the hype of 18:9 aspect ratio is no longer the same in the smartphone market, Nokia has yet implemented that display form factor in its budget offering.   The phone also comes with Android Go version of the Android Pie out of the box. And being the Android Go device, the phone will also receive regular updates and security patches. Other than that, the Nokia 1 Plus comes with an 8MP rear camera, 5MP front camera, and a decent 2500mAh battery.

This year, Nokia unveiled the Nokia 3.2 as a successor to both the aforementioned devices.   It features 6.26-inch display, which makes it taller than both the Nokia 3.1 and 3.1 Plus. On the top of its display, the Nokia 3.2 also features a tiny water drop style notch. The notch houses an 8MP selfie shooter, which also doubles as a Biometric authentication tool while unlocking the device via Face unlock feature. On the back, resides a 13MP shooter, which is accompanied by an LED flash.  On the performance front, the Nokia 3.2 has got a new Snapdragon 429 chipset. In terms of memory, the phone comes in two variants: one with 2GB RAM and 16GB of onboard memory whereas the other one comes with 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage. And the good thing about the higher memory variant is that the phone also comes aboard with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, which lacks on the 2/16GB variant.   The phone comes with a sizeable 4000mAh battery and boots with Android Pie right out of the box.

Not just on the price, the Nokia 4.2 looks premium in the design and looks side as well. The phone comes wrapped with glass both on the front and on the back. And polycarbonate material has been used on the frame.   Standing out from the rest of the budget smartphones, the Nokia 4.2 also comes with dual camera setup at the back. The phone houses a 13MP and 2MP camera duo at the back. It means that the phone is capable of capturing portrait images as well. On the front lies an 8MP selfie shooter. The selfie camera resides meticulously on the notch, which resides atop of the 5.71-inch HD+ display.   The phone is powered by Snapdragon 439 chipset, which we saw on the recently launched Vivo Y95 as well.

['The Nokia 9 Pure View fascinates with five cameras in total'],"['MWC 2019', 'Nokia']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['February 25, 2019']",2019-02-25 06:31:11+00:00,"['The Nokia 9 Pure View is nothing if not fascinating. This might just be the HMDC’s most audacious phone ever! I mean, five rear-facing cameras are just insane. And if all the reviews are to be believed, the cameras really do a good job. Yes, the device has more than just cameras but since, this is something out of the ordinary, lets set aside the camera side of things first before going on about other specs.  In the Nokia 9, all lenses are  12 MP sensors with f/1,8 aperture  but only two of then can shoot in colors, the others are Monochrome sensors made for the purpose of enhancing contrast and details in pictures. Similarly, all the cameras work together, you cannot use a single camera like the  Mate 20 pro  or the  P20 Pro  for that matter, with one exception, of course, the Monochrome lens!         Likewise, whenever the shutter is pressed, all five cameras shoot different exposures at the same time, which later is merged into one picture that is very detailed. Also, Nokia claims that depending on the scene, the individual cameras can even shoot multiple exposures to add better detail into a single image.  Well, you might even think its fishy because last year’s Snapdragon 845 can only support up to 3 cameras. So, how in the name of god does the Nokia 9 Pure View has 5 cameras, when it is using the 845? So, to clear out, Nokia has partnered with Light ( makers of the 16- camera L16 ) to include Light’s Lux Capacitor camera-control chip in order to manage 5 cameras. And in a similar way, Nokia has also worked with Snapdragon to make that possible. A lot of work being done here!  Similarly, the front houses a 20 MP camera for selfies.  Now, moving on, the device, as already stated, uses last year’s  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845   chipset with  Adreno 630 GPU . The device stands at 5.99 inches with a P-OLED screen and  Gorilla Glass 5 protection  at the front. The device also supports HDR 10.  As the trend goes, the device has an under display fingerprint sensor, facial unlock feature that works through the front camera,  wireless charging  and  IP67 water and dust resistance.  Having said that, the Nokia 9 Pure View is not a device made for everyone. Yes, it packs in a lot of things but the main focus here is the cameras, which might or might not be the selling point of the device. It’s certainly not the usual stuff though, so it’s definitely worth the hype for now!  Nokia 9 Pure View Specifications:   Operating System:  Android 9.0 Pie; Android One  CPU:  Octa-core (4×2.8 GHz Kryo 385 Gold & 4×1.7 GHz Kryo 385 Silver)  GPU:  Adreno 630  Chipset:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845  Display:  5.99 inches P-OLED screen with 1440 x 2880 pixels, 18:9 ratio and Gorilla Glass 5 protection  Rear cameras:  Five12 MP cameras, all f/1.8 aperture (2 RGB lenses, 3 monochrome lenses working simultaneously)  Video:  1080p@30 fps  Front camera: 20 MP  Battery:  Non- removable Li-Po 3320 mAh battery, USB 3.0, Type-C  Sensors:  Fingerprint sensor (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, and barometer.

Now, the company is said to launch another smartphone, the Realme 3, which will be a successor to the Realme 2 launched a while ago. And the company has leaked some astrological specs of the device! Astrological? I am glad you asked!  So, this new device is said to come with a starry look at the back as the media invite states, “Power Your Style, Let’s take a dive into the sky of stars”. The handset will be unveiled on March 4 in New Delhi. The company has been teasing about the new phone via various social media platforms.         In reference to the leaks, the Realme 3, unlike its predecessors, will not feature a diamond- cut design and will have some sort of starry design.  Similarly, the Realme 3 could just be the second device in the portfolio to feature the  MediaTek Helio P70 chipset . The company claims that the Realme 3 will have up to 30% increase in download speeds and 40% more power saving in comparison to the Realme 2 Pro! This should not be a surprise though because the P70 is based on a 12nm architecture opposed to the 14nm of the  Snapdragon 660 chipset .  Also, there are rumors of the phone having two different variants, one that will be a Global version and other will be an Indian version if the leaks are to be believed! And rumors also back the fact that the Global version will feature MediaTek’s Helio P60 chipset.  As far as other leaks are concerned, we are not yet very sure of them. Some rumors follow that it could have a 48 MP camera at the back and also a depth sensor, the megapixel count of it is not yet revealed. Also, it is suggested that the device, or say the two variants will come equipped with Bluetooth v4.2 and have a 16:9 aspect ratio display, which is not very common these days.  However, the device seems to be mainly targeted to outperform the  Redmi Note 7 . But, how it fares in real life, will be known once it’s here.  As far as the pricing is concerned, the Higher end variant of the Realme 3 will be around Rs. 15,000 in India.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/REalme-3-launch.jpg']

So with the help of all three cameras, the phone is capable of covering focal length from as low as 16mm up to 160mm, hence the 10x optical zoom.         This isn’t actually the first time we’ve seem 10x optical zoom on a smartphone. One of which was the Galaxy K Zoom, with focal length ranging from 24mm-240mm.

['Huawei P30 Lite will feature a tall display and triple rear cameras'],['Huawei'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 24, 2019']",2019-02-24 10:44:31+00:00,"['Last year’s Huawei P20 Lite was one of the most remarked phones of 2018. The phone was also launched in Nepal as  Huawei Nova 3e , and it was well received here as well. That’s the things of 2018. Now the smartphone is on the verge of receiving a successor. The Huawei P30 Lite is said to be unveiled on March 26 alongside the Huawei P30 and P30 Pro. Although there is enough time for the official unveiling of the P30 Lite, some of the specs have already been leaked. Huawei P30 Lite recently appeared on TENAA, that where its partial specifications have been divulged.  Huawei P30 Lite Specifications (Leaked)  Two variants of the P30 Lite were certified by the TENAA, which carried their identity in terms of models numbers MAR-AL00 and MAR-TL00. And when it appeared in TENAA, its database revealed the dimension of the phone to be 152.9 x 72.7 x 7.4 mm. And as suggested by the institution’s database, the phone will be relatively tall in terms of the display at the 6.15-inch size. Further divulgence includes the mention of Full-HD+ resolution display and a 3240mAh battery. Rumors suggest that the phone will also come aboard with an 18-watt fast charger.  Aiding to these leaks, further rumors and speculations have also been in the market. And the latest rumors suggest that the phone will get triple rear cameras at the back. And some leaked images of the phones readily cues that. Some rumors also claim that the triple camera module on the device will be a 20+16+2MP combo.              1  of 6                                                                              Apart from that, we can also see the use of a conventional type of fingerprint sensor at the back. On the front, a tiny water drop notch is conspicuous. Since such types of notch is quite trendy these days, that was more or less expected.  On the performance front, we might see Kirin 710 chipset implemented yet again. Last year, the  Huawei P20 Lite  and  Huawei Nova 2i  shared the same chipset. So we can also expect the same between the  Huawei Nova 3i  and the Huawei P30 Lite. Software-wise, the phone will boot on Android 9 Pie out of the box with Huawei’s custom skin EMUI 9.0 on the top.

['Huawei Nova 4 Full Review: In-NOVA-tive enough?'],"['Android', 'Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 22, 2019']",2019-02-22 17:09:28+00:00,"['Notch or bezels. This single statement has brought in a lot of discussions in the tech world where half the people are okay with notches while half criticize them. Amidst all this, Huawei brought to us something called a punch hole, which is literally a hole in the display. So, what does the Nova 4 pack other than a piercing in the display? Let’s find out!   Huawei Nova 4 Full Specifications   Design : Glass body, two-tone gradient coloring  Display : 6.41″ Full HD+ IPS LCD display with Punch-hole  Rear Camera : Triple setup, 20 MP primary lens with f/1.8 aperture + 16 MP wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : 25 MP selfie camera  CPU : Octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 970  GPU : Mali-G72 MP12  RAM : 8 GB  Storage : 128 GB  Battery : 3750 mAh  OS : Android 9.0 Pie with EMUI on top  Colors:\xa0 Aurora Blue, Red  Price: Rs. 64,900 [$550 internationally]   Display         First things first, let’s talk about the elephant of the phone, the front camera located on the top left corner. Well, I had expected this hole to be a little smaller than it actually is and that’s because Huawei’s official images show a different story. Nonetheless, having used phones with bezels, and notches in the middle, the Nova 4 is definitely a breath of fresh air. For me, new things are always welcome!  And the punch hole does not look so bad. When I use the phone, I completely forget that there is this black circle on one of the sides of the phone. It’s like notches, you get used to it! Sadly, the whole point of a display like this is to eliminate bezel, which hasn’t been done completely. You still see a thick line on the bottom with bezels even on the sides and top.  But this solution to the notch problem definitely gets a thumbs up from me, I would definitely prefer a punch hole display over a water drop notch. And for those who are wondering, the camera is completely below the glass.  Up front lies a 6.4-inch IPS LCD display with a full HD+ resolution. On paper, its competitor, the OnePlus 6T, certainly has an advantage due to its AMOLED display, but in real life, I found the Nova 4’s display to be on par with the 6T. The IPS display is bright, vivid, and colorful. The touch responsivity is buttery smooth and the overall experience you get with this display is great. There is also a setting that lets you choose your personal display calibration, so you can make the display pop out like you want to.  Design and build   Now, going for the aesthetics, the Nova 4 gives the vibe of the P20 pro’s looks, but the back doesn’t look like glass to me, maybe it’s high-quality plastic. Having said that, it feels comfortable to hold and just goes along in your hands. The power button is located at the right position and is very tactile. The fingerprint sensor is also located just where I want it to be and its really fast like other Huawei phones. The volume buttons are located on the left, they are tactile and where you want them to be.  Performance  The Nova 4 is powered by last gen Kirin 970. We know how good the Kirin 970 is, we have seen it on the P20 Pro and the Nova 3. And it has never once let me down. Yes, when you compare it with the Snapdragon 845 powered Oneplus 6T, the benchmark tells a whole different story. But, real life performance is quite good, I mean it is not the 6T level, but the Kirin 970 is no slouch by any means.   Huawei Nova 4 vs OnePlus 6T  Infogram  I played low-end to high-end games, browsed through a lot of applications and web pages, went through a ton of videos, but it has done everything in an effective manner. The phone even handles PUBG at its high setting. And the fact that it is able to do that is a win in itself.  The Huawei Nova 4 only comes in a single RAM variant which is 8 GB DDR4X, so you don’t have to worry about software hiccups if you are willing to cash in on this phone.  Benchmark Scores  AnTuTu V7 : 196513  GeekBench 4 (Single-Core) : 1765  GeekBench 4 (Multi-Core) : 6385  3D Mark (Sling Shot Extreme – OpenGL ES 3.1) : 1229  3D Mark (Sling Shot Extreme – Vulkan): \xa01184  Software  On the software side of things, the Huawei Nova 4 runs on Android Pie with EMUI 9.0.1 on top. Like I mentioned before, you won’t be facing any issues as far as software is concerned. With the EMUI 9.0.1 update, Huawei has evolved and the optimization is top notch. I have noticed smoother performance than how it was before on Huawei devices. And even some of the Huawei users have agreed to that.  However, you have the same bloatware on the device which I have been complaining for a few years now. Huawei should get rid of these applications on phones sold outside of China at least. Even I, as a reviewer, have never really used those applications as I think they just take up the internal memory. And this is where the OxygenOS on the OnePlus 6T shines, it is free of bloatware, and is one of the cleanest versions of Android with quite a lot of tricks inside the box.  Having said that, the Nova 4 also has several customizations. If you are a business person and want to keep your personal and business life separate, there is the Private Space feature. Likewise, you have motion control that consists of various gestures.  Camera   There are three cameras stationed on the rear side of the Huawei Nova 4 that work for a various purpose. The Nova 4 I reviewed comes with a 20mp primary camera, a 2mp depth sensor while the other 16MP camera works as a wide-angle lens.  Okay, first let’s talk about the aspect where a lot of smartphones don’t shine, the night environment. Taking both the Nova 4 and OnePlus 6T out for a comparison, I took a few samples from both the phones and the first thing I noticed is that the 6T has a better-detailed image with a good balance of exposure.   Zooming into a couple of the samples, you will see that the Nova 4 loses details while the 6T does a good job. Also, some of the samples from the Nova 4 just look muddy and noisy.   Now coming on to the night mode, well I need to mention that I don’t use its “default” nightscape feature the 6T has. I don’t like the images it produces so I just use the google camera port.  So comparing that against the Nova 4, I have to say that the quality of the samples you get will depend on the environment. In pitch dark, the samples are bad. But in presence of hits of sources of lighting, the Nova 4 does better work than the 6T. But the Nova 4 takes a lot of time to capture an image with night mode than the 6T does.   In the day time images, the details are a little better on the OnePlus 6T, and one thing I noticed with this same image is that the 6T has natural colors overall as the Nova 4 has tried to darken them.   Even the dynamic range is portrayed well by the 6T as the shadow details pop out without exposing the highlight details. But there were a couple of times such as the second image where Nova 4 has done better work in handling the dynamic range.        1  of 2                                      And when I talk about exposure, I have to say that almost all Huawei smartphones overexpose the images at times and this phone here is no different. If saturation is considered, yes, the colors on the pictures from Nova 4 look like they pop out more, but if the colors are zoomed into, they are unnatural.   The portrait is where both the devices do equally well, they have blurred out the necessary parts of the background and the subject has popped out quite well.   The other major shining point about the Nova 4 is its ultra-wide lens. The camera is able to capture wide-angle shots just by a single swipe. And this is quite useful. So with the wide-angle lens at the helm, I could capture wide-angle shots such as this. And even when I was in a crowded space where there was a little space to shoot photos, the phone let me capture a wide image.          This feature has been very helpful for me, so I will certainly miss it when I revert back to my daily driver.  Now the selfie is where the Nova 4 does well. Take the two samples below as an example. My shirt’s color is red so you can definitely notice where OnePlus 6T has done a blunder. The colors on the image don’t match the actual one as my shirt has turned pink, and the color tone of the overall image is colder which looks unusual. The Nova 4 though, nails the coloring and color tone.   Talking about the portrait selfies, both the Nova 4 and 6T are a hit and miss. You will notice that both the phones couldn’t identify my ear as the subject. The Nova 4 also has the lighting effect which can be applied to selfies, but I didn’t quite like it.   And even though the Nova 4 does well on the selfie front, it fares badly in video quality. The videos are just too shaky, and the colors are quite dull. Plus, it can only shoot 4K videos at 30 fps.  Extras  Extras really make phones standout these days, and even the phone companies have been excelling in this aspect.  So, let’s talk about the security options available on the device. The Huawei Nova 4 has both the fingerprint and face unlock feature. Both these options are snappy, and if it wasn’t for the unlocking animation, they would be as fast as the ones on the OnePlus 6T.   Now on to the speaker, there is a single mono speaker grill on the device. Comparing them side-by-side the speaker on the 6T is definitely louder than the Nova 4. However, there is the slightest bit of distortion on the 6T while the audio is much clearer on the Nova 4.  In terms of storage, the Nova 4 is available in only one variant which is 128 GB. One thing the 6T and Nova 4 share is the lack of microSD card slot. There’s also IR Blaster for the husband who can’t take control of the TV’s remote.  The earpiece on this device is in an unusual position at the extreme top. It did take me some time to get used to it as my traditional call position, if you call it, made the volume slightest bit lower. But there was no issue in the call quality whatsoever.  Huawei has also included an LED notification light sensor which you don’t see in phones ditching the traditional notch. And even though the light is in a weird position at the top, it still does the job for me.  And I think I forgot to mention this, the Nova 4 has a huge, huge, huge advantage over the OnePlus 6T, and yes, you guessed it right, it’s the headphone jack. Even though the jack is in the wrong place for me as it’s on the top, I have loved using my wired headphone on it.  Battery   There is a 3750mAh battery inside this device. In my heavy usage, the Nova 4 gave me a screen-on-time of around 5 hours 30 minutes to 6 hours which will definitely increase for a normal user.  Plus, there is an option here that lets users lower the screen resolution which, again, helps preserve battery. The OnePlus 6T also has a somewhat similar battery life, but the difference lies in the charging speed as OnePlus’ proprietary fast charging charges the 6T faster than Huawei’s 18-watt charger.  Conclusion  The Nova 4 is a decent phone no doubt, and it is facing stern competition from a lot of other devices, with the “mighty” OnePlus 6T being one of those. The effort Huawei has put into this smartphone here is quite commendable. The Nova 4 is a handy phone that looks quite good, it has top-notch internals including the wide-angle lens.  However, the pricing it comes with is similar to the 6T, which makes it the direct competitor as I mentioned before. Now I really like the Nova 4, but I still think the 6T takes the crown here due to the better camera, more-premium ness if that’s even a word, and just for the overall performance and usability.  However, the Nova 4 is 5,000 cheaper in Nepal and if you are looking for a phone with a wide angle lens over a telephoto lens and a better selfie camera, the Nova 4 is still a good choice.      Pros  Cons    – Punch-hole display is a good alternative to the notch  – Bloatware    – Good performance  – Average quality of night images    – Good display  – Better Alternatives']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Huawei-Nova-4-Review.jpg']

Samsung Galaxy S10+ Rear Camera   Primary: 12Mp sensor with 1.4µm pixels and 26mm-equivalent, f/1.5–2.4 aperture lens, Dual-Pixel\xa0AF,\xa0OIS  Ultra-wide: 16Mp sensor\xa01.0µm pixels and 13mm-equivalent, f/2.4-aperture lens  Telephoto: 12Mp sensor with\xa01.0µm pixels and 52mm-equivalent, f/2.4 aperture lens,\xa0PDAF, OIS  Up to 2160p/60fps video recording   As for the rear camera, it scored 109 points, tieing it up with the  Huawei P20 Pro  and the  Mate 20 Pro . The camera does especially well in exposure, color and bokeh category. The tests also reveal the S10+ is capable of “outstanding dynamic range”, pleasant colors and good exposure. Although, they also state that the testing did not include it’s ultrawide camera’s capabilities. Take a look at the score sheet below:   Conclusion  These are obviously great scores, but still, fall short in comparison to the Huawei P20 Pro or the Mate 20 Pro and those are already aging at this point. Again, the S10+ does offer an all-rounder camera performance, safe to say it’s a complete package that no other smartphone offers right now. But in the end, you also need to consider if DxOMark scores are a viable way of judging a smartphone camera, and a huge chunk of people disagree.

It is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, so, it’s definitely meant for the active ones. It has  IP68 Water and Dust Resistance  and is  water-proof up to 5 ATM  or 50 meters.\xa0  The watch packs a  360 x 360 circular display , weighs only  25 grams  and has wireless charging.

However, the rotating bezels we loved so much on the Galaxy Watch is now no longer here. Also, it can’t do all that the Galaxy Watch can do. After all, it costs $200 whereas the Galaxy Watch cost quite a lot more. It runs on  Tizen OS 4.0 , has  768 MB of RAM  and  4 GB storage , very similar to the Galaxy Watch.        The most important feature on this one has to be the new Heart Rate Monitor, which can now, also measure your blood pressure. It also offers Sleep Tracking, Fitness Tracking, various exercises, and overall health tracking. This watch can also detect up to 6 workout activities automatically, which is nice. But users will be able to engage in about  39 activities  on it. It will cost  $199  when it launches on March 8th.  Samsung Galaxy Fit   This is more of a FitBit from Samsung rather than a smartwatch. It also has rectangular screens like a traditional  Fitbit . The Galaxy Fit features a  0.95″ AMOLED touchscreen  with  120 x 240 resolution . It runs on the  Realtime OS  and shares many fitness features with the Samsung Galaxy Active – like the automatic workout detection and heart rate monitor.

It also packs a smaller  70 mAh battery  and connects via BLE. Running on Real-time OS, too, the features in it are more or less the same as the Galaxy Fit too.

With under-display fingerprint sensor on the  Vivo X21 UD , pop-up selfie camera on the  Vivo Nex  and the hole-less design on the  Vivo APEX 2019 , Vivo has garnered tons of applauds. And continuing with that innovative and winning spirits, Vivo has planned to drop a capable smartphone really soon. And Vivo iQOO is the phone, which seems to carry all the capable internals to place itself on the category of gaming phones.  Vivo iQOO smartphone  Most of the Chinese smartphone companies have a sub-brand. Huawei has the Honor, Oppo has the Realme, and Xiaomi has the Pocophone and Redmi. Vivo has also planned to expand its business implementing the same strategy. And for that, the company recently announced its sub-brand IQOO. Vivo is yet to launch a smartphone under the sub-brand iQOO. But we shouldn’t have to wait too long for that. Vivo recently announced to launch an iQOO smartphone on March 1. And going by the specifications, the handset looks quite like a performer.         On the recent post on Weibo, Vivo\xa0teased the iQOO smartphone with the tagline “Monster Inside”. And this “Monster” will feature Snapdragon 855 chipset and a whopping 12GB of RAM. On the storage side, the phone will get 256GB of onboard memory. A chunk of specs spilled also mentioned that the phone would come with 4000mAh battery. With this setup, the handset undoubtedly cues to be of gaming genre. We have seen such configuration with a powerful processor, tons of RAM, and massive batteries on the phones like  Xiaomi Black Shark , ASUS ROG phone, and  Razer Phone 2 . So we can expect the same with the Vivo iQOO smartphone.  Other than that, the phone may get the 44-watt fast charging, which probably would go by the name of FlashCharge. If it comes true, the FlashCharge would be the second fastest charging standard lagging just behind the Oppo’s Super VOOC charging technology.  On the optics front, the phone should be getting triple camera setup at the back. Although nothing has been mentioned about the front camera, it may feature the pop-up style camera which we recently saw on the  Vivo V15 Pro .

This new standard promises faster data transfer, better power management, and improved efficiency over its predecessor.  LPDDR5 RAM Modules Overview  The LPDDR4 standard has been in the business for around four years now. Although it was well-remarked for its speed and capabilities, the new one now has much better things to offer. The data rate on this new generation of RAM has received an improvement of 50%. This enhancement will also boost the performance of the next generation of portable electronics devices to a whole new level. The new RAM also promises improvements in capabilities of the mobile devices.  Other than that, the LPDDR5 RAM progresses on the throughput side. The LPDDR5 has a throughput of 6400 MT/s, which is a significant leap from the 3200 MT/s found on the LPDDR4. This advancement will considerably boost memory speed and efficiency for a variety of applications including mobile computing devices.        To achieve such an impressive result, the LPDDR5 RAM received an overhaul in architecture. It now features 16 Banks programmable architecture and multi-clocking architecture.  Other notable inclusion on it is the Data-Copy and Write-X features. Both of these features promise to make the device more efficient in terms of power.  According to Business Wire, “The Data-Copy command instructs the LPDDR5 device to copy data transmitted on a single I/O pin to the other I/O pins. This eliminates the need to transmit data to the other pins. The Write-X command instructs the device to write all-ones or all-zeros to a specific address. This eliminates the need to send data from the SoC to the LPDDR5 device.”  With such features, the LPDDR5 RAM modules sound\xa0amazing. But although it sounds promising when peeked into its feature list, we should really have to use LPDDR5 equipped device to truly feel the performance boost.  Talking about the pricing, it’s now available for JEDEC’s official website at a solid price of $355.

Samsung’s long-rumored, long- tested, long- conceptualized foldable phone is finally here. And we also have a name to it, Samsung Fold! It’s been seen along with the latest S- series smartphones today and as fancy as it looks, it will be sold as a premium smartphone. In terms of availability, the device will be launched on March 26th\xa0 this year with a massive price tag of $1980. Wow, now that is a lot of money!   Let’s talk specs now. The device has a huge 7.3- inch Infinity Flex Display. The main display, the unfolded one, has a QXGA+ resolution (4.2:3) and when the display is folded, the smaller one has a 4.6- inch HD+ (12:9) display. The Infinity Flex display makes the phone to have a huge screen that can be folded to fit in your pocket.        Having an over\xa0flagship price, this one packs the Snapdragon 855 chipset that is built in a 7nm architecture and has a total of 12 GB RAM and 512 GB of storage. The storage provided here is a UFS 3.0 (eUFS) that aids faster speeds.  Battery wise, it’s not just one inside, but two! The two batteries are separated by the fold but are combined in the Android operating system. So, altogether, the battery is 4,380 mAh.  At the rear of the device, there are three cameras, a 12 MP wide-angle lens, a 16 MP ultra wide lens and a 12 MP telephoto lens along with a 10 MP cover camera for selfies.   So, the huge screen allows for a three app multitasking at once that is being made possible by using an app continuity system to adjust three apps when you move between tablet and phone modes. Similarly, many apps, including popular ones like Youtube, Whatsapp, etc have been made optimized for the new display type and word id, Samsung is working closely with Google to ensure that the Galaxy Fold display supports Android 9 Pie.  Samsung, with the Galaxy Fold, has made sure that the back of the phone is sturdy enough to support all the folding and unfolding. It has a hinge system that has multiple gears that allow the device to transform from phone to tablet and vice-versa.  Yes, it’s nice to see Samsung finally bring out something that it has been trying for so long. However, it’s not just them doing it. Xiaomi has also very recently revealed a foldable smartphone. Similarly, LG has brought foldable OLED TVs.

Samsung launches FOUR variants of the Galaxy S10!'],['Samsung'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 21, 2019']",2019-02-21 03:26:40+00:00,"['After months of  leaks, renders and speculations , Samsung have finally launched its first flagship series for 2019, the Samsung Galaxy S10. The phone has been garnering a lot of attention for all the right reasons, and there are a lot of features to be excited about in this year’s Galaxy S10.  Alongside the four new variants of the Galaxy S10, the Korean Giant also showed off the Galaxy Fold, which will go on sale this April 26 for the price of $1,980, and the Galaxy Buds, the company’s new wireless earbuds. Samsung also took the stage to announce the newer variant of the Galaxy watch that can measure blood pressure.  Samsung has focused on a few new features for the Galaxy S10 this year. There’s a new under-display fingerprint scanner, the phones have ditched bottom and top bezels, the camera has received a revamp, and there are lots of other extra features in place.        Samsung Galaxy S10 Series Overview  Display  Samsung makes the best displays, and this time, it’s no different with the new Dynamic AMOLED panel. The company had been taunting other companies for opting for notches, while they stayed traditional with little bezels on the top and bottom. However, this time around the Samsung Galaxy S10 sports the Infinity-O display that has a display hole on the top-right corner of the device. This is certainly a plus as it doesn’t pop-out like other notches. However, it only covers a small area of the display, so, there is no room for the Iris Scanner.  Camera  The cameras on the Galaxy S10 have also received few new add-ons this time. There is an ultra-wide camera on the Galaxy S10, S10 Plus, and the Galaxy S10 5G model. Also, the latter will also have 3D depth cameras on the front and back for Augmented Reality (AR).  Fingerprint  In-display fingerprint scanners have been around for a while now. Samsung has taken that to the next level with its ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. While the traditional in-display sensors use excessive light to read fingerprints, the one on the Galaxy S10 will use little-to-none and will also be able to unlock the phone without waking up the display.  Extras  For extras, there are a couple of things to talk about. The Samsung Galaxy S10 will be able to reverse-charge other devices wirelessly like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. The new devices will be loaded with One UI out of the box. And you can apparently remap that infamous Bixby button this time. So, it will be interesting to see how the phones work in real life usage.  The Phones  The four new smartphones have been targeted towards different consumers. Like Apple came up with the  iPhone XR  alongside the  iPhone XS and XS Max , Samsung has released the cheapest phone of the S10-series, the Galaxy S10E. Just Like the previous years, there are two variants, the normal one and the Plus one. And like I mentioned before, there is also a 5G model which will be officially available in the near future.  Samsung Galaxy S10E   The cheapest of the bunch, the Galaxy S10E is Samsung’s answer to the iPhone XR. This smartphone has donned a 5.8-inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display with a single 10-megapixel selfie camera cutout on the top. It has dual cameras on the back with the secondary lens working as an ultra-wide camera. The Galaxy S10E powered by the Exynos 9820 will be available a few Asian countries (including Nepal), and in other regions, Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 will power the phone. The processor is aided by 6 GB and 8GB RAM. The Galaxy S10E offers 128 GB and 256 GB storage with an option to expand via a microSD card. There is a 3,100 mAh battery backing up the device. Unlike its siblings, this model does not feature the new in-display fingerprint scanner as it has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor.

The Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus come with a 6.1-inch and 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with Quad HD resolution. There is a single selfie camera on the Galaxy S10 while the S10 Plus has dual lenses with the second lens working as a depth sensor.  Unlike the Galaxy S10E, these two devices feature triple cameras on the rear. There is a 12-megapixel primary lens, a 12-megapixel telephoto camera, and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens. The devices are powered by the same processor the Galaxy S10E is, with 8 GB and 12 GB RAM variants available for use, according to the models.  For storage purpose, the Galaxy S10 comes with 128 GB and 512 GB versions with the Galaxy S10 Plus featuring 512 GB and 1 TB memory. And all of this is expandable as well.

This phone packs the  Snapdragon 855 SoC , a Samsung made Super AMOLED display, 48MP primary sensor and one of the fastest wireless charging on a phone. The only thing this phone doesn’t have is water resistance, and maybe the battery, at 3,300mAh, that might not satisfy everyone.  Display   The Mi 9 gets a  6.39-inch AMOLED  display with an  FHD+  resolution. It covers  103.8% NTSC  spectrum, can reach up to  600 nits  of brightness and a\xa0contrast ratio of  60000:1 . Screen to body ratio hovers at around  90.7%  and the bottom bezels have been reduced by 40%, which now stands at 3.5mm. And all this is protected by  Corning\xa0 Gorilla Glass 6 .        Internals  The device is powered by a  Snapdragon 855 SoC , paired with  6GB  of RAM and  64/128GB  of storage. Xiaomi also included the  Game Turbo  mode, which tunes the CPU and GPU for better gaming performance. The device has a\xa0 3,300mAh  battery, with support for up to  27W  wired charging, and up to  20W  wireless charging (fastest on a smartphone).  Cameras  The phone has three cameras on the back. The first is a  48MP sensor (Sony IMX586)  with a Quad Bayer filter. Aperture stays at  f/1.8  and the pixel size is a large  1.6um Superpixels . The second  16MP f/2.2  sensor is an ultra-wide lens with a  117-degree FOV . The last  12MP telephoto camera  works as a depth sensor with support for  2x optical zoom .   The whole back is guarded by  Gorilla Glass 5 , apart from those camera lenses, those are protected by a  scratch-resistant Sapphire glass \xa0for extra protection. Video capabilities cap out at  4k@60fps , with support for  4k@30fps ,  1080p@30/120/240fps , and  720p@960fps . As for selfies, a  20MP f/2.0  selfie camera with  0.9um  lens takes the responsibilities.  The same front camera is also in charge of unlocking the phone, aided by AI. The AI also helps out to reduce distortions on photos produced by the ultra-wide camera. Apart from the face unlock, you also get an  in-display fingerprint reader . That and the  NFC chip  allows you to use Google Pay for secure transactions. Furthermore, the phone also features a  dual-frequency GPS  and an  IR Blaster .  Price   Like the last time, there will be a transparent variant of the device. That one will come with  12GB  of RAM and  256GB  of storage and will cost you  CNY 3,999  or about $595.

['Vivo V15 Pro launched with 32MP Pop-up selfie camera & triple rear cameras'],['Vivo'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 20, 2019']",2019-02-20 11:10:56+00:00,"['Vivo started the trend of a pop-up camera with the  Vivo X21 UD  and  Vivo NEX . We didn’t get to see any of the devices in Nepal. What we got was the Vivo V15 Pro which landed here with a 32MP motorized pop-up camera. Let’s check out the specs, price, and availability of Vivo V15 Pro in Nepal.  Vivo V15 Pro Overview  Design and Display  The Vivo V15 Pro comes in a gradient blue color. The back of the device also features subtle patterns, which seem to exist right beneath the glossy finish. The front panel comes with an almost bezel-less display with just a 1.75mm thick bezel on the side and 2.2mm bezel on the top. Although Vivo has not spoken on the thickness of the chin, the company remarked that the V15 Pro rocks with a whopping  91.64% of the screen to body ratio .         And talking about the front panel, the screen on the front houses a  6.39-inch display , which features  Full-HD+ resolution . And there is no any sort of punched-hole or any other sort of ugly notches. So the screen truly looks immersive. And to achieve that, Vivo has employed a pop-up selfie camera and hid the ambient light sensor and the proximity sensor under the display.   That’s not all, Vivo also squeezed a  fingerprint sensor beneath the display . The smartphone maker claims the fingerprint sensor on this device to be of fifth-generation. And as the generation passes by, the Vivo V15 Pro promises to  unlock the device just in 0.37 seconds . Seems like the gap in the unlocking speed between this new type and conventional type is getting really close.  Camera  Over the years, Vivo has gained quite a popularity, especially in the camera front. And continuing the tradition, the Chinese tech titan has packed a 32MP selfie shooter. It also happens to be the world’s first  32MP pop-up selfie shooter . In addition to taking selfies, this front snapper also doubles as an authentication tool in the Face Unlock feature.  Even on the rear panel, the V15 Pro is rich in terms of cameras. The rear panel houses a  triple camera setup at the back , which is a combination of 48MP main camera (wide-angle), 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 5MP depth sensor.   Although the primary shooter has a  48MP resolution , it only captures 12MP images. The camera does  4-in-1 pixel binning  to get bright and sharp images. It is also said that the sensor used here is a  Samsung’s ISOCELL GM1 sensor , which we saw on the  Redmi Note 7 . So when the whole tech world has been hyped about this whopping 48MP camera, we really have to perform the Vivo V15 Pro review to see its performance in the real-life.  Similarly, the 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera can capture up to the 120-degree field of view. Lastly, the third 5MP depth sensor comes to action on capturing the portrait images. So the triple camera setup on this device seems to do plenty of jobs.  Performance and Memory  Performance-wise, the phone has got  Snapdragon 675 chipset  paired with either  6GB or 8GB of RAM . On the storage side, the phone has got  128GB of native memory . It can be further expanded up to 256GB via a dedicated SD card slot. Although the SD675 is not the top of the line processor, it’s still better than the SD660 on the last year’s  Vivo V11 Pro . It is also a relatively newer chipset and can handle some Triple-A games without a fuss.  Talking about the horsepower, the phone rocks with a 3700mAh non-removable battery. Although it supports dual-engine fast charging technology, the presence of the Micro USB port looks rather antiquated.  Vivo V15 Pro specifications:   Display:  6.39-inch Super AMOLED display; 91.64% screen to body ratio; 2.5D curved glass on the top  Resolution:\xa0 Full-HD+ (2340×1080 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Chipset: Qualcomm\xa0Snapdragon 675 @ 11nm technology  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core (2×2.0 GHz Kryo 460 Gold & 6×1.7 GHz Kryo 460 Silver)  RAM:\xa0 6GB  Storage:\xa0 128GB; Dedicated SD card slot for memory expansion up to 256GB  OS:\xa0 Android 9 (Pie) with FunTouch OS 9 on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Triple camera – (48 MP Quad Pixel Sensor, f/1.8, 1/2″, 0.8µm, 78-degree FOV) + (8MP Ultra-wide-angle, 120-degree FOV) + (5MP depth sensor, f/2.4), LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 32 MP pop-up selfie camera  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (under-display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Connectivity:  Dual SIM (Nano + Nano), Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 5.0, Micro USB 2.0, USB OTG support, 3.5mm headphone jack  Battery:\xa0 3700mAh with dual engine fast charging technology  Colors:\xa0 Topaz Blue, Ruby Red   Vivo V15 Pro Price in Nepal [Updated 2020]\xa0  There are two variants of Vivo V15 Pro but only the 6/128GB variant is available in Nepal.

['Realme C1 Review – Another good budget phone story'],"['Realme', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['February 19, 2019']",2019-02-19 10:20:59+00:00,"['So the  Realme C1   is a phone that launched quite some time ago. And the Realme brand is known for providing good specs at affordable prices. This one is a budget phone that seems to have pretty decent specs on paper. Which also led to many asking for it, even before it arrived in Nepal. And it did, some two weeks ago. But, it came at a time when there is competition in the market. So, how does it fare with the competition?  Realme C1 Specifications:   Display: \xa06.2- inches IPS LCD Capacitive Touchscreen with 19:9 aspect ratio  Protection: \xa0Corning Gorilla Glass 3  Resolution: \xa0720 x 1520 pixels  CPU: \xa0Octa-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A53  Chipset: \xa0Qualcomm Snapdragon 450  GPU: \xa0Adreno 506  RAM: \xa02 GB  Storage: \xa016 GB, expandable up to 256 GB (dedicated slot)  OS & UI: \xa0Android Oreo 8.1 with ColorOS 5.1  Rear Camera: \xa013 MP\xa0 f/2.2 camera and\xa02 MP f/2.4 depth sensor dual cameras with\xa0LED flash, HDR and panorama  Front Camera: \xa05 MP f/2.2 sensor with HDR  Video: \xa01080p@30\xa0fps  SIM (s): \xa0Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by)  Battery: \xa0\xa0Non-removable Li-Ion 4,230 mAh battery (Micro USB 2.0),\xa0USB On-The-Go  Connectivity: \xa0Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, WiFi Direct, hotspot  Sensors: \xa0Accelerometer, proximity and compass  Price in Nepal : Rs.  15,499   Design & Build  Being in the budget segment, this phone has a  plastic build with an aluminum frame . It is big and makes its presence known in the hands. The plastic back has a glossy finish, making it look premium but leaving it prone to fingerprint smudges and scratches. So, I recommend using it with the transparent case that comes inside the box.         The back has nothing but the dual camera setup. No fingerprint sensor, here. So, basically, this looks like the  Oppo A3s , but in a different color. The left side has the volume rockers and the SIM slot, and the right has the power button. The micro USB port, 3.5 mm headphone jack and the speaker grill rest at the bottom.      Ports and Buttons   1  of 3               Power Button         Ports         Volume Rockers                     With a plastic construction, the phone is light and has a good grip. But might be a bit too big for some people. The look and feel of the phone is pretty nice, and I feel like there are very fewer phones like this at this price.  Display  On the display front, something worth mentioning right up front is that even though it’s a budget phone, you do get a  Gorilla Glass 3 protection . That was an option not available on the Oppo A3s, which is more expensive than this. There is also a notch up top housing a selfie camera, earpiece, and some sensors. The notch seems to have an okay size. It also has a considerable chin and bezels, too.  The screen is a  6.2″ IPS LCD panel  with  HD+ resolution  and  19:9 aspect ratio . So, yes, this is the Oppo A3s back and front. Only cheaper.   It’s a good display – with quite the punchiness, but some may find the colors too vibrant. It could do with a bit of calibration. The brightness is also fine…you can use it okay in the sunlight, but not without some adjustment, though. It comes with Auto-Brightness features, so, it’s all well.\xa0There are also various display modes. A night shield built into the software of the device with a ‘Blue-light filter’, ‘black-n-white’ mode and a ‘comfortable night-time reading’ mode.  For the price, I really liked the display overall. There’s nothing you have to complain about, except that it could have some balanced colors rather than all over your face.  Camera  As for the camera, it packs a dual camera setup at the back with  13 MP primary lens  and a  2 MP depth sensor .   And for a budget phone, the photos actually come out great…but only in good lighting conditions. In good lighting, the colors come out close to natural, the level of exposure is balanced, and the white balance is good too. The details are there…and you won’t be complaining about the camera very often.      Rear Camera Samples   1  of 6                                                                              The portrait mode seems one of the best edge detection for the price point. The subject gets a nice focus while there is enough blur in the background.             As for low light images…well, this is the part where most budget cameras tend to struggle. And this is no exception. Images lack sharpness, and there are very less details to go on. In artificial indoor lighting, the amount of details can be acceptable, but for night shots, the photos are not usable at all.             The front camera is a  single 8 MP camera . And the pictures from it are not that great. They’re actually okay, packing enough details and fairly accurate color reproduction, but not as expected. If you want a strong social media game, then, this selfie camera might not be for you. Low light selfies are also not worth mentioning anything about.   And of course, there is the beauty mode which you can choose various levels of. But they look pretty aggressive. You can use up to level 3 of beauty levels, but nothing beyond that – if you take my advice.      Selfie samples   1  of 6               Normal selfie         Normal selfie         Normal selfie         Portrait selfie         Normal selfie         Normal selfie                              Overall, the rear camera setup is a good one, but the selfie camera can do with some improvement.  For high-resolution images,  Click here .  \xa0Performance  In this department, the Realme C1 features a  Snapdragon 450  chipset, which to me, looks like the de-facto processor for budget phones, i.e. if they want to be good enough. And it does not disappoint for the most part. I did get some lags every now and then while navigating through the UI, but it didn’t freeze or anything.  It also appeared as if the touch was not responsive enough, but that might have been due to the sluggishness in the UI too. And while the benchmark scores for this device show a lot of potentials, gaming on it is not exactly a “walk-in-the-park”. It is more like a tired walking kind of thing, where you rest quite frequently. What I mean is, it suffers from frequent stutters and lags.  You can play Asphalt 9 or PUBG, at low settings. And they run okay at low frame rates. But normal games like Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Golf Battle, etc, run smooth enough, though.  With  2 GB of RAM , multitasking is also not very good. The apps won’t stay open in the background for too long, and switching between them is not seamless. And opening a lot of tabs in your browser or messenger app can take a toll on your user experience. But at the end of the day, if you’re not using the device heavily, it’ll work just fine.  Also, the phone doesn’t heat up as much. You can feel it getting hot while gaming, but it’s nothing too extreme.  Benchmark Scores  AnTuTu V7 : 74125  AndroBench Sequential Read : 291.45 MB/s  AndroBench Sequential Write : 51.05 MB/s  GeekBench 4 (Single-Core) : 627  GeekBench 4 (Multi-Core) : 3105  3D Mark (Sling Shot Extreme – OpenGL ES 3.1) : 282  3D Mark (Sling Shot Extreme – Vulkan): \xa0332  PC Mark for Android (Work 2.0 Performance) : 4242  Software and UI  The phone currently runs on  Android 8.1 Oreo  with  ColorsOS 5.2.1  on top. And this is the same operating system as any OPPO phone in the market, which we didn’t like anyway.  The UI is one of the major shortcomings of smartphones, including its optimizations. The UI, as a whole, is a bit too colorful, and not in a good way. It isn’t pleasing to look at, and neither is the functions.\xa0Everything appears like a big mess! On top of the bad optimizations, the UI itself is a bit laggy. There’s bloatware everywhere, and of course, they aren’t useful.  Realme needs to put in a lot of work into this device…but if you’re not comparing it with other phones, or if you’ve been using other Oppo devices, you might not even care about it.  Battery and Storage  As for the storage, you get a 16 GB storage on board, which of course, is not enough. But there is a dedicated microSD card slot, with which, you can expand the memory up to 256 GB.  The battery on this device is stellar. It has a  4230 mAh battery , with which, it lasts for about 1 and a half days in normal usage. Even with heavy usage, it will easily last throughout the day.  The only problem? With a large battery and  no Fast Charging , the charging time shoots up to like 4 hours! If you use a 2A / 5V charger, you can get done in 2.5 hours.  Extras  To talk about the extra features, there is not much to say though. Its speaker is fairly loud with decent, clear sound quality. And even though it has no fingerprint sensor, it’s got a pretty fast Facial Recognition. It uses the front camera for that, and not an IR sensor, but like most Oppo phones, this is good.  Conclusion and Verdict  The Realme C1 is a good phone, no doubt. And for a price  Rs. 15,500 , this is one of the best contenders at this price. The battery life is phenomenal and the display is pretty great. I like cameras as well, and most of the stuff is good.  And I can’t stress this enough, but this is just the Oppo A3s but cheaper. And we were not fond of the Oppo A3s as much as this one, because of the price. That phone cost close to Rs.20000 when it launched, and now, it costs some Rs.18000. But the same phone with another name costs considerably less. So, this one looks much better.  The problem? It’s got quite the competitor. The recently launched  Samsung Galaxy M10  looks like a much better performer. It’s got a better display, smaller notch, and a better look and feels, except the camera. And that, too, for Rs.2000 less.  Pros:   Great battery life  Right price  Good display  Nice portrait shots   Cons:   User Interface  Sluggish performance  Display calibration  Poor selfie camera']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/realme-c1-review.jpg']

All of them give you similar features and come at a similar price. Amidst all this, Realme has launched two phones in Nepal, The Realme 2 Pro and the Realme C1.  So, today, we will be talking about the Realme 2 Pro. It has been my daily driver for the last three months and here is my full and detailed review about it.         Realme 2 Pro Specifications:   Design : Aluminium frame, Plastic back  Display : 6.3 inches, 1080×2340 pixel 19.5:9 aspect ratio IPS LCD display  Rear Camera : 16 MP f/1.7 + 2 MP dual back camera  Front Camera : 16 MP f/2.0 selfie camera  Processor : Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC  GPU : Adreno 512 GPU  RAM : 4GB  Storage : 64GB; expandable up to 256GB  Battery : 3500mAh battery   Also Read:  Realme 2 Pro Price in Nepal  Design:  The Realme 2 Pro came after the era of gradient designs and I must say, this simple touch of a plane colorful back still catches my eye. I chose this Blue variant, which is sort of a light icy Blue, which I still think is very appealing.  But as eye-catching as it is, most of the times, I used it with the Silicon case that came along in the box because the entire phone is made of plastic. As careless as I am, I didn’t want to destroy my daily driver. And after this long usage, my phone still looks good as new. There are minor scratches at the back but the shiny back has compensated to hide it very well.   At the front too, I got a built-in screen guard that took up many scratches but it started to wear off a little bit near the notch, so I took it off altogether. And impressive is that the Gorilla Glass 3 protection has held up pretty well-preventing scratches on the display.  But I think this phone is a little too thick for my liking and other users of this device also may have felt the same.  It’s weird that the battery is not too huge and still the phone is thick and relatively heavy. Plus, with the cover on, it looks thicker than ever. But does not matter in usage though, so it’s okay.  Display:  Keeping the Realme 2 pro as a daily driver, I have also reviewed quite a few devices and looking at all of them, I think the V-shaped notch and the minimal bottom bezel accounts for a good full view screen on this one.  But through all this time, I have wished for more brightness, which is just moderately bright outside. Nothing that has affected my usability but I have wished for more sometimes.   Other than that, I have quite liked other aspects such as the colors are bright and vibrant and playing games or watching videos or simply browsing has been a good experience.  The notch on the top is not very obtrusive so I kept in on all the times. You do have an option to hide it for some apps but it was okay for me.  But through all this time, I have missed the LED notification light. You can turn on notifications on the lock screen and even clear it from there which has somehow made it easier for me but again a notification LED is always welcome.  Cameras:  Now we’ve come to the part where the Realme 2 pro has shone with all its potential, the cameras. Honestly, I thought that the cameras will be okay, nothing much to fuss about, but this one has exceeded my expectation, except in one aspect, which I will talk about later.  So, starting off with the back cameras, the pictures are very colorful and look pleasing to the eye. The details are on point, the saturation is on point and I have loved the images. Look at this picture of the Bouddha Stupa here, what do you think about it? Nice isn’t it?      Realme 2 Pro back camera samples   1  of 17                                                                                                                                                                                            The fact is that this one uses the same Sony IMX sensor at the back previously used on the more expensive OnePlus 5T and the results are awesome. I get the same impressive images every time I go around shooting with this phone.  But something that has bugged me a lot since day one is, you cannot change the settings from the camera app itself! And finally, when I dug deeper, the settings could be changed from inside the settings menu. I mean you have to individually go there, search and change whatever settings you want to alter. As good as the cameras are, this has been a big hassle for me.  But in the camera app, the icons tell you clearly, which is what function, so it is not a difficulty finding the portrait mode or HDR mode, etc.  Talking about the HDR mode, it helps improve detail from bright and dark areas on images very well. But, when you take a picture with an exposed background, it does help preserve details but the pictures come out slightly unnatural. Not saying the images are not good though!

There is EIS to make your videos stable, you won’t notice the stabilization while shooting videos but the outcome is good I must say. Among the 4k, 1080p and 720p options, I liked the FHD resolution more in terms of quality.  Autofocus in both videos and photos is good, nothing to complain about.  Okay, now let’s talk about the aspect I have disliked, the portrait mode. I might sound very harsh when I say this, but the 2 MP depth sensor is not soo good in functioning. The edge detection is poor, blur intensity is poor and inconsistent! But, you do have studio various studio lighting effects, among which I like the RIM lighting effect.      realme 2 pro back camera samples portrait mode    1  of 4                                                          The night shots are what you would expect. They are nothing to be excited about, yet not that bad either. But certainly, the cameras find it a bit hard to focus during the night.

They are colorful, natural and detailed. The HDR option helps when the background is exposed. Also, there is stickers option which has been very fun for me as well as my friends. The beauty option again, I didn’t use it too much.

But there are no studio lighting effects in selfie portraits, which I would have loved to have! Never mind, Realme, you can put it there in the upcoming device of yours!  For high res samples,  click here .  Performance:  Talking about the performance, it has the Snapdragon 660 SoC which we have seen in many phones lately, but I was a bit skeptical about the Color OS affecting the full potential of the chipset but it has actually not been that way.  I have had no complaints about the performance of this device whatsoever! I have not felt lags and stutters on this device while multitasking or gaming and the like. Coming to gaming, the Adreno 512 GPU is quite a performer. I play PUBG very often in medium settings without any major stutters. Also, Asphalt runs pretty smooth but\xa0 F1 racing goes through some stutters sometimes. Not to the extent of frustration though!  But,\xa0 the speakers at the bottom get distorted at highest volumes and has spoiled my gaming experiences a lot. But with earphones, it is not that bad. Also, the speakers tend to cover up with fingers, which again adds up to not so good gaming experience. So, even though games run pretty well, I’ve had issues.  I have been using the 4 GB RAM 64 GB storage variant that has EMMC storage, which may be the reason why games or apps take a while to install.  The fingerprint sensor at the back has been working fine, it is fast and gets the job done 100% of the times. And facial unlock is swift too during the daytime. Since it’s the front camera doing the job here, it does not perform well during night time.  Also, like other Chinese phones, this one does not certify DRM L1 certification, but since I don’t use Netflix or Amazon prime contents on my phone, it wasn’t a dealbreaker!  Benchmark Scores  AnTuTu V7 : 128703  AndroBench Sequential Read : 291.18 MB/s  AndroBench Sequential Write : 173.76 MB/s  GeekBench 4 (Single-Core) : 1468  GeekBench 4 (Multi-Core) : 5506  3D Mark (Sling Shot Extreme – OpenGL ES 3.1) : 1229  3D Mark (Sling Shot Extreme – Vulkan):  1184  PC Mark for Android (Work 2.0 Performance) : 5778  Software:  Now the software, and you know I am not a huge fan of the Color OS, especially because the app icons are not very good looking and surprisingly there is no theme center to change one either! So, unless, you download another launcher, you are stuck with it.  Things can change and the CEO of Realme has also promised the Pie update in the next few months so maybe the latest Color OS based on Pie will have something refreshing. And one more thing, since my use, I have gotten a couple of updates, the latest security patch dated January 5.      Realme 2 Pro UI screenshots   1  of 4                                                          \xa0  And some two months ago, I got the update that made the notifications clear up from one direction! Previously, it was so annoying that you had to swipe once and click delete but to some extent, it has been corrected. I say to some extent, because, it can only be cleared from one direction, the story is the same if you try from the other side!  Battery:  In the Realme 2 pro, you get a modest 3,500 mAh battery, that will last you for a day. It has been the same since day one up until now, I mean, the battery life has not degraded.   The area where Realme could have done better here was by including its very own VOOC Fast charging tech. It doesn’t cost too much to borrow its own tech, right?\xa0But, they haven’t, so charging will take around 2.5-3 hours to get fully juiced up. And yes, it uses Micro USB port.  Conclusion:  So, as I said earlier, I have used this device for so long and even though I don’t like the UI so much, I have gotten used to it. But then again, I would like to suggest the company to focus more on the UI part. Also, though the phone looks good, I don’t think plastic backs are here to stay. For long time use me as well as other people would like to have better material on their phones.  SD 660, no doubt is a good processor, but as an intense user, maybe for the next one, Realme should go with a more powerful processor like the SD 675 or the SD 710! I would also like to see Realme adding the USB type C port, maybe a bigger battery, and VOOC charging. Also, the portrait mode needs attention, I mean for such a good camera, why compromise on any aspect?  So, my verdict would be, yes, the device has some shortcomings, but in my opinion, they are not that big of a deal. I have loved using this phone and will continue using it as my daily driver for the next few months.  So, if you are thinking of getting this one, for the price it asks, especially the discounts you get right now, this device is still a very good choice!  Pros   Awesome front & back cameras  Good display  Good performance   Cons   Sub-par portrait images  No fast charging  Plastic Build']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/realme-2-pro-review.jpg']
['Everything we know so far about the Huawei P30 series'],['Huawei'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['February 19, 2019']",2019-02-19 06:42:00+00:00,"['The  Huawei P20 lineup  was a collection of capable smartphones, and now, is time for its successor, the P30 series. Although yet to go official, going by its predecessor, the new lineup should be great, if not the best. Expectations are high for the new lineup, and going by the numerous leaks and rumors, they should deliver. With the month of March coming close, let’s look at what we could expect, and everything we know so far.  Pricing  Pricing for the P20 Lite was $450, the regular P20 was roughly $780, while the Pro version costs a little over $1000. With that, we do not expect Huawei to lower the price for it’s newer models. A $50 premium for the P30 and $100 more for the P30 Pro would be a safe assumption.  As for the P30 Lite, that should not cross the $500 threshold. However, with Samsung’s next flagships launching soon, that could also affect the cost of Huawei’s upcoming flagships.        Design  A small teardrop notch, in-display fingerprint sensor, glass back and a headphone jack. Yes, the headphone jack is making a comeback, if rumors are to be believed. The same rumors point out four cameras for the Pro model, rounding up a total of five. As for the non-pro version, renders only show three cameras on the back.   The sensors are placed horizontally while the flash sits beside the cameras instead of the bottom, make of it what you will. Further leaks, especially from the case makers place the phone’s footprint at\xa0149.1 x 71.4 x 7.5mm for the regular P30.  Internal Specs  The Kirin 980 will be in charge of the performance, as it’s still Huawei’s best and brightest SoC. We are expecting a 5G variant for the phone, which will use Huawei’s own Balong 5000 modem designed for the  Kirin 980  itself.\xa0The P30 lite will get a humble Kirin 710.   Reports hint at a 12GB RAM variant but don’t specify if it’s the base or the top of the line variant. As for the software, all phone will come with Android 9.0 out of the box. We have no information regarding their battery life, but\xa0the P30 will have a 22.5W fast charging support while the P30 Pro bumps it up to a 40W.  Display  The smallest of the bunch will possess a 6-inch IPS LCD display, and this one will also not feature any in-display fingerprint sensor. As for the P30, it will offer a 6.1-inch screen while the P30 Pro bumps the size to 6.5-inches.\xa0Both models will come with in-display fingerprint sensors and OLED displays.   As for resolutions, we hope it’s a bit higher that FHD+, at least for the Pro model. But according to new found information, both phones will be stuck at\xa01080 x 2340px. Except for the P30 Lite, that one gets a 1080x2312px panel. The Mate 20 did bring a 1440p display resolution, and there is still a chance the “new found information” turns out false.  Camera  With up to four cameras on a single smartphone, they should and mostly do perform excellently, if history stands as an example. With chart-topping DxOMark ratings, can we even expect anything less? As of now, their\xa0camera setup sits as follows:  Huawei P30 Lite   20 MP, f/2.2, PDAF  16 MP, f/2.2, 1.0µm, PDAF  2 MP, f/2.4, depth sensor  24 MP, f/2.0 (Selfie)   Huawei P30   40 MP, f/1.8, 27mm (wide), 1/1.7″, PDAF/Laser AF  20 MP, f/2.2, 16mm (ultrawide), 1/2.7″, PDAF/Laser AF  8 MP, f/2.4, 80mm (telephoto), 1/4″, 5x optical zoom, OIS, PDAF/Laser AF  24 MP, f/2.0 (Selfie)   Huawei P30 Pro   38 MP, 1/1.8″, Sony IMX607 (Yet unreleased sensor)  40 MP, f/1.8, 27mm (wide), 1/1.7″, PDAF/Laser AF  20 MP, f/2.2, 16mm (ultrawide), 1/2.7″, PDAF/Laser AF  8 MP, f/2.4, 80mm (telephoto), 1/4″, 5x optical zoom, OIS, PDAF/Laser AF  24 MP, f/2.0 (Selfie)    To add up, a few rumors suggest a 10x optical zoom lens will also make an appearance. While the 38MP sensor rumored to debut on the P30 Pro remains uncertain, the rest of the specs still look pretty impressive as it is. And it should, this is the same company that bought us the excellent quad-cameras on the Mate 20 Pro.  Huawei P30, P30 Lite & P30 Pro Launch Dates  Huawei just confirmed the phones will launch on March 26 in Paris, France.  So, what do you think of Huawei’s P30 series, which has the potential to be the best smartphone of 2019?

['HP Pavilion 15 Power Gaming Laptop Review – When laptops do things just right'],"['HP', 'Pavilion Series', 'Reviews']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['February 18, 2019']",2019-02-18 11:37:54+00:00,"['With the new  RTX gaming laptops  launching every week or so, the prices of GTX 10 series laptops are getting some decent price cut and today I have with me is the HP Pavilion Power 15 laptop that’s available for an insane deal at $650 or Rs. 95,000 here in Nepal. So, is this the best budget gaming laptop right now? We are going to answer that in this HP Pavilion 15 Power Review!   HP Pavilion 15 Power Specifications:   CPU : Intel® Core™ i5-8300H (2.3 GHz, up to 4 GHz, 8 MB cache, 4 cores)  Display : 15.6″ IPS (1920 x 1080)  GPU : GeForce GTX 1050Ti 4GB GDDR5  RAM : 8 GB DDR4-2666 SDRAM (1 x 8 GB)  Storage : 1 TB 7400 RPM HDD; 16 GB PCIe NVMe Optane memory  Ports : 1 HDMI 1.4; 1 headphone/microphone combo; 1 RJ-45; 1 USB 3.1 Type-C™ Gen 1 (Data Transfer up to 5 Gb/s); 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Data transfer only)  Connectivity : Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n/ac (2×2) and Bluetooth 4.2  Battery : 52Whr  OS : Windows 10 Home  Price: Rs. 98,000    Buy HP Pavilion 15 Power here  Design & Build  So, starting off with how it looks, it is somewhere between a typical gaming laptop, and a regular notebook. It’s not your typical rectangular laptop. Just because it doesn’t cost as much as high-end gaming laptops don’t mean it can’t look like one.         With sharp edges and uneven looking exhaust grills, it gives a bit of an OMEN vibe here, but of course, it doesn’t go all out. It doesn’t scream gaming, just subtly says so. After all, there has to some difference between affordable and more expensive models.  In terms of looks, there is this green accent going around all over. From the keyboard backlighting to the HP logo on top, everything is green. Maybe they’re taking the “Go Green” thing too seriously.  But the green accent looks pretty good on the laptop. It is a welcome refreshing touch from the invasive red color or the RGB lighting, although it might look cool. There aren’t many laptops that look like these. The  Dell G7  with its blue accent looked great as well. And this one has this “Matrix” vibe going on for it.   The build quality looks pretty solid. There is a minimal amount of flex on the lid and on the keyboard deck when pressed. It seems it can take a fair amount of abuse even though most of it is plastic. But due to that very reason, it is pretty light for a gaming laptop. At 2.2 kilograms, this is not your lightest gaming laptop, but for a 15” gaming laptop, there are only a few of these. The hinge, on it, seems tight and you can’t open it with a single hand. But that’s not something that many will be bothered by.  Overall, this is a machine that does not scream gaming, but only subtly says so. As much as you can game on it, you can also take this to work.  Ports and Connectivity  As for the ports and connectivity, this laptop has a great choice of those. A Bluetooth 4.2 may not be one among them, but it’s hard to expect anything better on a budget gaming laptop. But it does have a stable 2 x 2 ac Wi-Fi, though.      HP Pavilion 15 Power Ports   1  of 2                                      Also, it gets enough ports. Three USB-As, a USB-C which does not have Thunderbolt 3 support, an Ethernet port, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a headphone jack make for a good selection of ports.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The keyboard seems fine. It’s not perfect, but better than you can expect on a budget gaming laptop. Keys are clicky and provide good tactile feedback. They are also well-spaced and with 1.5 mm key travel, typing on it is pretty comfortable. The only problem is the uncomfortably squeezed arrow keys, which is a bit annoying while navigating.   Overall, the keyboard is good. Of course, there are a lot better keyboards out there, but most users should have a good time with it.   The same can’t be said for the trackpad. The trackpad is wide, but not long enough. Tracking is also not as smooth as I’d like. And with ELAN drivers, gestures are not as accurate either. I wish they’d included Windows Precision Drivers, but they haven’t. This makes the trackpad usable, but you’d want to get a mouse, even for non-gaming purposes.  Display  The display on it is as good as it gets, for a budget gaming laptop. It’s a Full-HD IPS panel, and the viewing angles are pretty good. The resolution goes fairly well for games, as well as movies. The color accuracy takes a hit with around 60% of the sRGB and 40% of Adobe RGB covered. So, not something you’d want to use for content creation.  If you put it side by side with another laptop with a better display, you get an actual difference in colors for the same photo, or video. Along with the contrast, the display is good enough for gaming, and that’s all.   Brightness maxes out at 250 nits. That makes it okay for indoors, that too, under proper lighting. It’s not something you can use under harsh lighting conditions or outdoors. Dark scenes in movies can be difficult to make out too, which you might have to get used to.  What makes this display great, though, is the slim bezels around the side. This is not XPS level thin, but it is thin enough to make it even more appealing. This also makes the laptop looks like a premium device, even though it’s not.  Performance  In terms of performance, there’s nothing to complain about. The 8 th  gen Intel i5-8300H is a stellar performer. You can boost it up to 4 GHz, and that’s quite a lot compared to the 7 th  gen i7-7700HQ, which, maxed out at 3.8 GHz.  Combined with an 8 GB of RAM, this is good enough for all kinds of tasks. It can handle any kind of usage for day to day work. If you have over 20 tabs in Google Chrome, and still want to do a bit of Photoshop or such, you can. You can even game with all that open in the background. So, performance is not an issue.  As for gaming, you get two variants on this laptop – one with GTX 1050 and another with a 1050 Ti. And as any sane person would, I suggest you pay the extra premium and get the Ti version, as it is slightly better than the regular one.  Our unit was also the same, and the performance was as expected from other laptops with the same Graphics. It can run most games at Full HD with settings at medium. Even so, many games cannot reach 60 frames per second. For that, you’d have to turn them down to low.  Of course, games like DOTA and CS:GO can give you quite the frames, but for games like PUBG, Battlefield, and Fortnite, I’d recommend you go no higher than medium.  Thermals  The thermals on it are good. It’s not exactly a very powerful CPU and GPU combination, so, thermals are not really a concern with this laptop. But you can expect smooth gameplay without thermal throttling even after 2 hours of continuous gaming. The fans can act even if you’re doing nothing intensive, but they’re not really loud.      Cooling Vents   1  of 3                                                Storage  The laptop, by default, comes with a 1 TB Hard drive at 7400 rpm. And as hard drives go, they tend to be sluggish…if you’re used to SSDs. But since this laptop has an M.2 SSD slot, I don’t see any reason you should not install an SSD.  I did it on this laptop, and the performance improved by a lot! Boot times decreased by over 20 seconds, although it might vary depending on the SSD you choose. Apart from the added cost, there’s no reason that you should not get an SSD. Even a 128 GB SSD stick will do, and you can use it for the OS and the HDD for the storage.  Battery  With a 52 Watt-hour battery and the fact that it is a gaming laptop, you cannot expect much from it. After slightly more than 2.5 hours of using it to browse the web, stream, and some office tasks, it ran out of juice. So, for gaming, you’ll definitely need to plug it in.  Conclusion  The HP Pavilion Power 15 is a laptop, put together really well. This is a great choice for anyone who doesn’t want quite a dent in their pockets. At $650 for the 1050 Ti version, this looks like a great value for money. Add a small cost for an SSD, and it is still a great buy. Even in the Nepali market, you get the Ti version for Rs.98000, and the regular 1050 variant for Rs.92000. So, this laptop is an ideal choice for anyone looking for a good budget gaming laptop.   Plus, this laptop has quite the room for upgradeability. You get two RAM slots but only one slot is used. So, this can go up to 32 GB. And of course, there is the M.2 SSD slot. Pretty good, if you want to upgrade your device later on.  It has got the power, the style, and just the right price. Everything looks pretty good to me. This is a perfect example of when a laptop does just the right things.  Good things about the HP Pavilion 15 Power   Design : It suttle, unique, fresh and the green accent helps  Performance : It’s fast, fluid and no bottlenecks  Gaming Performance : Almost any games are playable at FHD under the right settings  Thermals : Very less thermal throttling  Price : I mean, for the price, these specs are pretty great   Bad things about the HP Pavilion 15 Power   Battery : 2.5 hours of light to moderate usage']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hp-pavilion-15-power-review.jpg']
['Vivo Y91 Review: Can it compete against the Galaxy Ms and Redmi Notes?'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Vivo']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 18, 2019']",2019-02-18 11:35:18+00:00,"['Vivo makes headlines when it comes to their concept phones and flagships with their innovative products. And there are the Vivo’s midrange V-series which are quite good too. But there’s also their Y-series, their budget segment, which actually accounts for most of their market share. And today I have here, the Vivo Y91, which is going head to head against the  Samsung’s M-series  and  Xiaomi’s Redmi phones . So, does the  Vivo Y91  provide as much value as its competitors? Let’s find out!  Vivo Y91 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.2-inch LCD display, 2.5D curved glass on the top  Resolution:\xa0 \xa0HD+ (720×1520 pixels) @ 19:9 aspect ratio, 270PPI pixel density  Chipset:\xa0 MediaTek Helio P22  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core 2.0GHz Cortex A-53  GPU: \xa0PowerVR GE8320  RAM:\xa0 2/3GB  Storage:\xa0 32/64GB; Expandable up to 256GB via SD card  OS:\xa0 Android 8.1 (Oreo) with Funtouch 4.5 on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 (13 MP, f/2.2, PDAF) + (2 MP, f/2.4, depth sensor), LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 8MP, f/1.8  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 4030mAh non-removable battery  Colors: \xa0Starry Night and Ocean Blue  Vivo Y91i Price in Nepal (2/32GB) : Rs. 20,990  Vivo Y91 Price in Nepal (3/64GB) : Rs. 25,990   Also Read:  Vivo Mobiles price in Nepal  Design and Build  Let’s start the things with its design. Since Vivo Y91 is a budget handset, it comes with a polycarbonate back like most of its competitors out there. So this device doesn’t feel particularly sturdy. However, the back panel of the Vivo Y91 is glossy painted with dual-tone gradient colors, which is truly amazing. And the one I have is an Ocean Blue, which surely is an eye-candy. Also, it has curvy edges on its stylish back, which aids in an easy grip. So it didn’t slip through the hands on my use. But despite having a dazzling look, the smartphone also has its own imperfections in the design. The glossy back in it also a fingerprint magnet and requires cleaning quite often.        Display  On the display front, there is a tall 6.22-inch IPS panel with a tiny notch on the top. Vivo likes to call it a Halo FullView display. Although I particularly don’t like the notches, the one on the Vivo Y91 is very tiny and less obtrusive.\xa0So I didn’t have any problems whatsoever.   But what bugged me big time while using this Vivo device was its resolution. The handset comes with a merely HD+ resolution. A tall display and an HD+ resolution wasn’t the combination I was looking for. On close inspection, I was able to discern pixels in its screen at times and it was more evident while viewing contents on YouTube.   But other than that, I have nothing much to complain on its display. The viewing angle is decent, the colors look fine, and it also has good sunlight legibility. Plus there is an ambient light sensor to keep track of the surrounding brightness and to adjust the brightness of the display accordingly. So I didn’t have any hassles of altering the brightness every now and then.  Camera  Now let’s move on its cameras. Vivo smartphones have always defined themselves on the camera front. And I was quite hopeful about the Vivo Y91 on the camera front. But the camera here was more or less a mixed bag. Normal images looked fine with a decent amount of details and a good amount of accuracy.      Rear Camera Samples   1  of 7                                                                                        Some portrait images also had similar traits. But most of the images I took from this device lacked a proper edge detection. Some images also had an inappropriate blurring, which was absolutely frustrating. There is also a feature to readjust the focus area and to tune the blur intensity after taking images. But I couldn’t mend those uneven blurring even with that feature. So capturing the portrait images got me absolutely downhearted.      Portrait Samples   1  of 6                                                                              Low light images weren’t that impressive either. They quite lacked the punch when it comes to the details. And the noises and grains also were quite substantial.      Low light images   1  of 5                                                                    Heading to the front, there is an 8MP selfie camera, which rests quite perfectly on the notch. Although the front shooter pulls out some social media ready selfies, it beautifies the faces almost all the time. Even when Face Beauty turned off. Although I don’t like such beautifications, it may quite please the people who fancy beautified selfies.      Normal selfie     Normal selfie     Portrait Selfie     Low Light selfie     Low Light selfie   The phone also has a portrait selfie feature, which can come really handy at times. But since blurring of the background takes place entirely through software intelligence, the resulting portrait images lack proper edge detection.  For High-resolution images,  Click here .  Performance  On the performance front, the smartphone comes powered with a MediaTek Helio P22 chipset. On the storage side, there are two variants: one with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and another with a combination of 3GB RAM and 64GB of internal memory. And Vivo has yet again played a name game here. It has named the higher end variant as the Vivo Y91 and the basic variant as the Vivo Y91. And since the processor is same, the performance will be more or less the same on both the devices.  And talking about the performance on the Y91i, it can be a good daily driver if you are into normal apps and games. You can use Facebook, messenger, YouTube, and Instagram without any issues. The real trouble starts while playing high-end games. Asphalt 9 is not compatible with this device. And PUBG is playable only at the low setting. And even on the low setting, lags and stutters were inevitable. So if you are into gaming, you should probably skip this one.  Benchmark Scores  AnTuTu V7 : 59349  AndroBench Sequential Read : 287.17 MB/s  AndroBench Sequential Write : 100.09MB/s  GeekBench 4 (Single-Core) : 838  GeekBench 4 (Multi-Core) : 3641  3D Mark (Sling Shot Extreme) : 377  Software  Software-wise, the phone comes with an Android Oreo out of the box. At this time, I would have loved if it had an Android Pie but that’s not the case here. And in this already old OS, Vivo has added its own custom skin, the FunTouch OS 4.5 on the top. But using the FunTouch OS was no fun at all. The UI looked like a clone of an iPhone. The feature to swipe up to bring the toggle buttons has an uncanny resemblance with the iPhones.  Also, there is no app drawer. So all the installed apps get cluttered in the home screen, which looks absolutely displeasing. Furthermore, the lack of a search button in the setting is equally frustrating.  But over time, I kinda get used to it. And I must say that the UI has bundled a ton of features. Motorbike mode, Game mode, and Do Not Disturb mode were few among the many features I liked. All of the aforementioned features mute the calls and notifications while you are riding a bike, playing or a game or in a meeting. There is also the feature for navigation through the gestures, which is quite popular these days.  Security  Security wise, the phone has the fingerprint sensor and a Face Unlock feature to unlock the device. A rectangular fingerprint scanner resides on the back, which recognizes the fingerprints accurately and unlocks the device really fast. So I didn’t have any problems while unlocking the device via fingerprint sensor.   Using the Face Unlock feature wasn’t a problem either, at least in the bright light. It was really snappy on the bright light setting. But it wasn’t the same in the low light scenarios. Since it doesn’t have a dedicated IR sensor, only the front camera comes into play while unlocking the device. So it doesn’t quite recognizes the faces in the dark and doesn’t unlock the device at all.  Battery  The Battery is the biggest highlight of the Y91. You get a big 4030mAh battery, which, combined with the low-res display and a low-end processor, backed me for almost two days on normal use. Also, there are Super Saver and Low Power Mode to extend the backup even further.   Vivo Y91 Charging Time  Infogram  But to include a 5-Watt charger to charge a 4000mAh battery is plain stupid. It takes 4 hours of charging time with its included charger! So, I used a 10W charger, which took me 2 hours and 48 minutes. So if you want to juice up fast, you need to buy a separate 10W charger.  Conclusion  To sum it up, the Vivo Y91 is a good-looking phone with great battery life. The camera also looks decent for the price. But with these features, the Vivo Y91 is not particularly outstanding in the budget price point. The last year’s  Redmi Note 5 AI  and the recently launched  Galaxy M20  pack better value. So, we urge Vivo to focus more on the choice of processor, at least provide a FullHD display and refine the Software to stand out in the competition.  Pros   Appealing design  Decent Cameras  Great battery life  Snappy fingerprint sensor and face unlock feature   Cons   Disappointing portrait mode  Low-res display  Clumsy UI  Below par performance']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vivo-y91i-review.jpg']

And the  MSI GL63 8SE  in one such laptop that belongs in the basic category. It packs the  RTX 2060 graphics card , which is the base model for the RTX series. And the price does start at $1500 and over 2 lakhs in Nepal. So, does the RTX graphics deserve all the hype it is getting? Let’s find out in this MSI GL63 8SE review.  MSI GL63 8SE Specifications:   Processor : Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake i7 8750H 2.2GHz-4.1GHz  Display : 15.6″ Full HD (1920 x 1080) 60Hz  GPU : GeForce RTX 2060 6GB GDDR6  RAM : Dual Channel 16GB DDR4 2666 MHz (Max 32GB)  Storage : 1TB HDD + 256GB NVME SSD  Ports : USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A, SD m-DP, HDMI (4K output @30Hz)  Connectivity : Killer E2400 Gaming LAN + Killer Wireless-AC AC 9560 (2*2 a/c) + BT  Keyboard : Full-Size SteelSeries RGB Backlit Keyboard  Webcam : High Definition 720p Camera  Speakers : Dynaudio 2x3W Speakers + 2x3W Sub-Woofer, Nahimic 3, Hi-Res Audio  Battery : 6 Cell battery 51Whr  OS : Windows 10 Home  Price: Rs 2,12,000\xa0  Buy Link   Also Read:  MSI Laptops Price in Nepal  Design and Build  This one looks like your regular MSI gaming laptop with its size and gaming-oriented design. Of course, it’s not the best design from MSI because…well, this could be the cheapest RTX gaming laptop they have. It is big, and a bit bulky, too. And the build is plastic all over.         With the plastic build, it weighs light, about 2.2 kg, which is less than the  GE63 Raider  with a similar form factor, but with a metal build. The top lid has a smooth matte finish but attracts quite a lot of finger smudges, which, again, is not new for  MSI laptops .  But the design has not changed from the GTX model. So, everything is pretty much the same. There are vents at the back and both sides of the body. Also, the lid has the red strips of Red lighting at both sides of the MSI Dragon logo. Nothing new on that front. Also, you don’t get the RGB lighting on it, only red – both on the keyboard and the lid.  Even though it has a plastic build, there is no flex on top of the keyboard deck and very less of it on the lid as well. Still, I can’t shake the feeling that it won’t be able to handle drops or impacts. Also, you cannot open the lid single-handedly, but that’s not something everyone will complain about.   This laptop is something that does give off a gaming vibe, but there’s nothing WOW about it. Overall, the design is not something that you’ll love about this laptop. Maybe this kind of design was fun a year back, but we need a bit more now.  Connectivity and Ports  As with any other MSI laptop, the connectivity is pretty great! The port selection is nice, with an Ethernet port, a USB-C port without Thunderbolt 3, an SD card slot, a MiniDisplay port, an HDMI port, Audio-in and Audio-out ports and three USB-As.      MSI GL63 8SE Ports   1  of 2               Ports on the right         Ports on the left                  For Wi-Fi, there is the Intel 9560 ac adapter which is a reliable Wi-Fi card and there is also a Killer E2400 Gigabit Ethernet, along with Bluetooth 5.\xa0The speakers are a bit tiny, not to the point you have to complain, but nonetheless, it could have been a bit louder.  Keyboard and Trackpad  For the keyboard, this is your Steel Series keyboard, so, you know what to expect. The keyboard has only Red backlighting this time. And it doesn’t seem like you can program it due to the absence of the Steel Series software by default. I did not get the chance to download the software and test it, so, that’s for another day.   However, the keyboard is still Steel Series, so, it’s a great one. You get just the right amount of clicky feedback along with the right amount of mushiness. There’s ample key travel, and they’re well-spaced…except for the Windows and Function key, which seems weird.  But you can interchange those two keys from the Dragon Center, so, there’s that. Anyway, the gaming experience on the keyboard is great, and typing is very comfortable too.  Just the opposite of that is the trackpad. This is one of the worst trackpads I’ve ever used. I seriously thought this one was a faulty unit. But maybe, this was one of another comprises on this laptop. The tracking is pretty bad, just even for normal tracking. Gestures are very frustrating to use, because they work only, maybe 3 times out of 10.   Trackpads on gaming laptops are generally, never all that great, but this one is something else entirely. You will definitely need to use a mouse to save yourself the frustration.  Display  On the display front, you have a 15.6” screen with some amount of bezels on it. There is a variant of this laptop with a 120 Hz display as well. But ours had only a 60 Hz refresh rate. And that makes quite a bit of difference while gaming.  The display on it is not good. I was quite disappointed by the display on this thing.  Granted this is a budget gaming laptop with an RTX, and it is bound to have some compromises. But, still, I just don’t feel like this is something you should get for over $1600.   It is a Full HD display, with a TN LCD panel. And being a TN panel, the viewing angles are not that great. You will see severe color shifts at sharp angles, so, if you’re consuming media, make sure the viewing angles are right. But the TN panel does give it a fast response time.  Also, the colors appear a bit washed out, and MSI does claim a 94% NTSC but maybe that’s on the other model. Because, by looking at the display of this one, I think it’s no more than 45%. It’s just that bad. So, if you are a graphics designer or a video editor, just stay away for this one. Strictly.  The brightness, however, is, good enough. You may not be able to use it outdoors that well, but dark scenes in movies can be made out easily indoors. And that’s enough for gaming as well.  Performance  In the performance department, you get the Hexa-core 8 th\xa0 gen Intel i7-8750H processor. Now, this is something we’ve seen in a bunch of high-end laptops, so, let’s not go on about it.  This is a great processor, and it does not bottleneck the graphics setup in any way. Combined with 16 GB of RAM, and an NVMe storage, normal performance is as good as it gets.  On to the gaming part, and this is where the laptop shines! I almost want to forgive all the bad things I’ve said about this laptop…because this is meant to be a good gaming laptop, and it delivers! This is where the RTX 2060 shines.  For instance, PUBG was playable at FHD resolution at over 100 fps on Ultra settings! And that’s a lot of FPS! Fortnite, too, gave us quite a lot of frames. We also played other games, and the performance was slightly better than on any other laptop we tested with a GTX 1070. We didn’t get to test the Ray-Tracing and its other features, but we can say that this can outperform 1070.  And your gaming experience on this laptop is going to be better if you get the one with a 120 Hz display.  Thermals  Of course, this is your MSI gaming laptop, so, you have this Cooler Boost option to get the maximum performance out of your system. You get a dedicated button to do so, which is a nice feature. Also, MSI’s Dragon Center lets you make custom profiles for your various needs, be it gaming or any other intensive tasks.   But even without it, the laptop can do pretty well. I mean, it does get hot, even on top of the keyboard deck, but refuses to throttle on the performance. Being a powerful gaming laptop with fairly thin frames, it is natural that it heats up, but since there are no drops in frames, we can assume the thermals are normal.   You can play games like GTA V for hours on end, and still, it will keep running like butter.  Storage  As for the storage, you get quite a lot of it. There’s a 256 GB NVMe SSD, which spits out up to 1500 MBPS of read speeds. It only manages up to 300 MBS write speeds, but I can live with it.  Also, you get a 1 TB Hard-drive, so, you should have no problems regarding the storage. Plus, there are other storage configurations available to suit your needs too.  Battery  This laptop packs a 53 Watt-hour battery, which barely runs for 3 hours on normal usage. I’ll say expect no more than slightly over 2.5 hours, actually. As for gaming, it’ll give you an hour at best, so, make sure to plug it in before your gaming sessions.  It does charge fully in less than two hours, but I think it’ll spend most times plugged in, so, that’s not really worth mentioning even.  Conclusion and Verdict  The MSI GL63, for me, looks like the basic forms of a gaming laptop with an RTX GPU. This laptop is quite a performer, but it does compromise on a lot of things. Things like design, display, trackpad and battery life take quite a hit, and for a price of over $1600, it can look like you should be getting more.   But as I already said, even the most basic gaming laptops with RTX can cost over $1500, so, I guess, this is actually a budget version of an RTX gaming laptop.  So, this is a laptop that’s all about that sweet gaming performance, and not much more. And in some cases, the performance is similar to those laptops with 1070 in them, which do not compromise on the non-gaming aspects, like the MSI GE63 and the GS65. Also, they’re getting some price cuts…so, maybe, they could provide better value than this? Therefore, it’s up to you whether you want to pay that extra premium for the RTX Experience or not.  But, in Nepal, this laptop costs Rs.212,000 and here, we don’t get any laptop with a GTX 1070 for that kind of money. So, here…it’s all good, but in the international market…maybe, there are other options you want to explore.  Good Things about the MSI GL63 8SE   Keyboard : Great key travel, clicky, well placed  Storage : Fast NVMe SSD, ample HDD storage  Thermals : Well maintained temperatures, no throttling  Performance : Six-Core processor, as good as it gets for the time being  Gaming Performance : High frame rates, can play any game at FHD resolution   Bad Things about the MSI GL63 8SE   Display : TN panel, one of the worst we’ve seen, washed out colors, even worst viewing angles  Trackpad : Really bad tracking, one of the worst out there  Battery Life : 2.5 hours under normal usage  Design : Played out design  Build : Plastic build, arises concern over its durability']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/msi-gl63-8se-review.jpg']
['Reasons Why Phones in Nepal are expensive compared to other countries'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['February 18, 2019']",2019-02-17 22:45:33+00:00,"['Here’s the scenario. You need/want to get a new phone. You consider your budget and search for some good phones around it. Then, you scour the Internet for their prices. Finally, you are discouraged by the fact that for your budget, you can get better phones in India and China than the ones in Nepal. Sounds familiar? It should be, because that’s the way it is.\xa0Every now and then, Nepalese consumers\xa0are complaining about the unreasonable pricing of the smartphones. Compare the prices of the phones here to international market. Actually, why go very far? Take our neighbor India for example. Put the same phone side by side, with the same specs and materials, and the prices of smartphones in Nepal appear inflated. However, different factors come into play in this. Here are some Reasons why Smartphones in Nepal are expensive compared to other countries:  Recent Tax Increment  We are all very aware of the recent budget allocation for this fiscal year by the Nepal government, particularly, because it has made everyone unhappy. Prices of almost everything has gone up, including smartphones and gadgets. Before the increment of taxes, smartphone retailers paid 13% VAT, and on top of it, 40% of the VAT was refunded to them at the end of fiscal year, making it a net of 7.8% on taxes.  Before  After  But according to the new policy, the 40% VAT return isn’t available anymore, and  on top of the 13% tax, another 5% excise duty has been added, making it a total of 18.65% on taxes . Which took the prices of phones by up to 10%. And that’s only smartphones. For other gadgets, there’s a whole different thing going on. So, with it, prices are increasing, even though both suppliers and consumers are unhappy.        But, there are rumors about the government waiving the 5% excise duty, so, maybe we can breathe a bit easy after that.  Distribution Channelling  This is, most likely, the primary reason for gadgets being expensive in Nepal. Yes, there are no in-house manufacturers, but there also aren’t any official company retailer stores to these gadgets here.  And phones\xa0exchange hands between various channels before they end up in the country – through agents, wholesalers, distributors to finally to retailers. There’s the company a.k.a., the brand itself, then, the National Distributors (ND), then Regional Distributors (RD), then retailers, and finally, mobile stores. This long chain in the middle increases the price fairly quick. With RD’s nicking off almost 15% commission and retail shops getting around 7-8% commission, this really adds up to hick the price.\xa0 Now, the question might arise, why do you need an ND? What is the role of an RD? Why such a distribution channel? Why can’t smartphones sell directly to the retailers? But from the company’s point of view, NDs and RDs are kind of an assurance for them.  How so? ND’s import the smarpthones, companies aquire a bank guarantee or some kind of guarantee from them, so that there is less risk. And similarly, NDs acquire the same kind of guarantee from the RDs, for their security. And this creates a linked chain.\xa0The retailers deal with the RD who is responsible for placements, and the RDs are managed by the ND, who, in turn, deal with the Mobile brands.  Apart from security, the NDs also have their own sales team, called “Sales Promoters”, whose job is to promote the sales of their products in mobile stores. NDs also have their own marketing team, sales officers, and product team, who help improve the sales and marketing of the product.  As for the RDs, they possess local-level knowledge of the market, and maintain good relations with the retailers. They also provide incentives to the retailers to motivate them to sell their own products.  Therefore, RDs and NDs look like an integral part of the smartphone business. And this might create another question: Why don’t brands go online and cut off NDs and RDs entirely? This brings us to another reason:  Buying and Selling Practice  The smartphone market in Nepal differs from other countries in terms of sales practices. If you are aware, you’ll notice that  many companies sell their phones online via various websites like Amazon, BestBuy, etc. with good discounts, even ! For example, Xiaomi sells their phones to India and China online mostly, as they have a strong presence online and have good payment gateways. This means companies don’t have to establish luxury retail stores that add to their expenditures, which in turn, affect the prices of the phones.  The same isn’t the case in our country. With a very limited presence of e-commerce and lack of good payment gateways, companies have to establish stores for customers. Even with some online retail stores on the rise, we prefer to see and feel the product before we buy them. As a result, companies have to invest in retail stores, increasing the price we pay for their phones.  Quantity of product sold  We’re all familiar with the theory of economies of scale, i.e. larger the quantity, lower the price.\xa0 Quantities of products sold in India, China, US or other countries are higher compared to Nepal.  While smartphones ship in millions to those nations, we play in the thousands  here, affecting the cost per unit of those products. And so, this adds some burden on the prices of such products.  Lack of In-House Manufacturing Plants  This is no surprise. Our country has no in-house manufacturing plants of any kind of mobile phones or gadgets. Almost all gadgets are imported, starting the chain of middle-men, excise and custom duties. Add shipping costs to it, and you end up with putting quite a dent in your pocket to buy gadgets here.\xa0Countries like India and China has its own manufacturing plants (factory) which cuts off the custom TAX and transportation costs. For eg., Mi India set up a manufacturing plant and launched its first in-house made in India phone, the Redmi Note 5A. The phone had an aggressive price of NRs. 11,200 while the same phone launched for Rs. 17,500 in Nepal.  If things were produced in-house, maybe, we’d only have to pay shipping and taxes on raw materials, which are considerably less than finished goods. Also, there would be less ware-housing costs associated with it too. Which would make the products cheaper, but it’s not the case.  Make-In-India Policy  Recently, the Indian government formulated a policy, which favors in-house production of goods in India. And so, there are many smartphone manufacturing plants in India. For example, apart from Xiaomi’s factory there, Samsung’s largest smartphone factory is in Noida, of India.\xa0 And due to it, they get the advantage of not having to pay any external taxes, which make the products cheaper, be it online or offline. This, in the end, is in favor of the customer. And even though, we are a neighbouring country, there are by taxes and excise duties and policies. So, by the time these products arrive in Nepal, they incur quite a lot of additional taxes. Hence, the prices go up…  Dollar Fluctuation  This one, is another reason for the expensive smartphone prices in Nepal. How so? Well, when any ND imports smartphones when the dollar rates are expensive, then, even when the dollar prices falls, the smartphone prices can be high because the importer paid higher.\xa0  But at times when the imports are made when the dollar exchange rates are low, it can also ensure relatively cheaper prices. So, it’s not necessary that this reason leads to expensive prices, always. But most of the times, the prices are high.  Greed Factor  So, I guess that’s all the most important reasons. But I’d also like to mention one more thing. That is, when most of the brands come to Nepal, their prices are already set high, and that, I think is the greed factor. Smartphone brands should be setting their prices low initially, to penetrate the market, but that does not seem to be the case.  Now, I’m not saying all smartphone brands do that. Sometimes, the prices are quite reasonable. Like the Galaxy Note 9 for example. The international price was $1000, and here, it arrived here at Rs.110000!  So yes, there you have it. The reason why smartphones and electronics are expensive here. What are your views on this? What do you think can be done? If you guys think we left out some other reasons, do let us know in the commen']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/reasons-phones-expensive-nepal.png']

So, with numerous details about the smartphone leaked, let’s round up everything we know about the phone so far.  First things first,\xa0the Mi 9 will sport the  Snapdragon 855 SoC , and that shouldn’t be\xa0a surprise to anyone at this point. Although RAM and storage, options remain uncertain.

The battery size comes in at 3500mAh with 32Watts of fast charging support.\xa0  The phone gets a 6.4-inch IPS 1080x2280px panel. As for the bezels, Xiaomi claims to have reduced the chin size by about 40%, compared to the Mi8. It’s now just 3.6mm thick, but what we are more concerned about is that notch. Leaked renders of the smartphone reveal a waterdrop notch at the top while the display itself is protected by sapphire glass (most likely just covering the lens area).  We could also see the Mi 9 Explorer edition launch on the same day as well. And while we are at the subject of design, the phone will be available in four colors. Those being gradient blue, gradient pink, solid blue and solid black/grey.  Cameras   Triple camera setup is all but confirmed for the Mi 9. The primary lens will be a 48MP Sony IMX586 sensor with an f/1.75 aperture. This one will employ Super Pixel technology, aka  pixel binning .

Let’s start off with the specs:        Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e Specifications     DISPLAY  10.5” WQXGA Super AMOLED    CHIPSET  Snapdragon 670 SoC, 64bit Octa-core processor (2×2.0 GHz\xa0 & 6×1.7 GHz)    MEMORY / STORAGE  4GB + 64GB or 6GB + 128GB, microSD up to 512GB    CAMERA  Rear: 13MP Front: 8MP    PORT  USB3.1 (Type C), POGO Type-C headset connector Provided    SENSORS  Accelerometer, Fingerprint Sensor, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Hall Sensor, RGB Light Sensor    WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY  Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac 2.4G + 5GHz, VHT80 MU- MIMO, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth v5.0    GPS  GPS, Glonass, Beidou, Galileo    DIMENSION, WEIGHT  245.0 x 160.0 x 5.5mm 400g    BATTERY  7,040 mAh, Fast Charging    OS  Android 9.0    ACCESSORIES  Book cover Keyboard, POGO Charging Dock, Slim cover,\xa0Book cover\xa0(not included)    VIDEO  Recording: UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) @ 30fps Playback: UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) @ 60fps    AUDIO  4 speakers sound by AKG, Dolby Atmos®      Going by the specs, this seems to be a capable device. It gets a decent processor, ample memory options, good connectivity, and all of the bells and whistles one would expect. Furthermore, the 5.5mm of thickness, a SuperAMOLED display, and Android 9.0 out-of-the-box just sweetens the deal even more. So, this seems like a good deal. But can it beat the  $329 iPad ?        Apple iPad 2018 vs Galaxy tab S5e  Both tablets sport attachable keyboards, but only one of them supports a stylus, or in this case, the Apple Pencil. Why did Samsung skim out on S-Pen stylus support? We will never know. In a twist of events, the Tab S5e looks more like an iPad pro than the iPad 2018 itself. But that’s a story for another day. Moving on to the display, Samsung’s AMOLED display is definitely better than that LCD IPS panel on the iPad.  But the SD670 is just no match for the A10 Fusion. Plus with added optimization goodness of iOS, well, you get the point. So, keeping connectivity and cameras aside, isn’t iPad a better device overall?   Most users who own an iPhone will go for the iPad. Majority of Samsung owners either don’t care much about tablets and even if they do, there is a very less chance of them buying a Galaxy Tablet. Plus, we see news every month about tablet sales falling down. As for if it could work as a laptop replacement, the Microsoft Surface Go, which is an actual laptop does a better job.  The tablet should go on sale soon (Q2 2019) as pre-orders will begin in March 2019. Pricing starts at $399 for the 4/64GB model while the 6/128GB configuration is priced at $479. Both are Wi-Fi only variants with an LTE version launching soon. Alongside the Tab S5e, Samsung also introduced us to the 2019 Galaxy Tab A 10.1, a budget segment tablet with the  Exynos 7904 SoC  and pricing of around $240.

But the camera giant Canon hasn’t capitulated in the game yet. It hasn’t been much the company joined the mirrorless ecosystem. But even in that short span of time, the Japanese optics master already garnered a fair amount of applause. And in that run, the  Canon EOS R , which launched last year, proved to be one of the highly remarked full-frame mirrorless cameras. Now in less than six months of time, Canon has yet again released a new full-frame mirrorless camera. Namely known as the Canon EOS RP, the new camera is targeted at mainstream consumers. And for the very purpose, the device has been priced aggressively.   Canon EOS RP Overview  The Canon EOS RP comes in a small factor and is relatively lighter with the weight of mere 485 grams. Talking about the sensor, the sensor here features 26.2MP resolution, which is lower than what we saw on the more expensive EOS R. Nonetheless, the resolution is remarkable for a midrange camera.        Since the device is a mirrorless camera, it has an electronic viewfinder (EVF), which has the size of 0.39-inch. And this colorful OLED EVF flaunts a resolution of 2.36 million dots and a 100% coverage. On the display front, there is a 3-inch TFT panel which is enriched with 1.04 million dots. Since this screen also happens to be fully articulated, you can also capture the selfies. This feature can come really handy for the vloggers.   Other than pricing, the most impressive feature of this camera is its capability to record 4K movies. However, the 4K Ultra-HD movies can only be recorded at 24/25fps. Also, the 4K videos suffer a crop, just like the  Canon EOS 5D Mark IV . Although the presence of the 4K recording option is commendable, these complications might be repulsive for some videographers.

However, people need to wait for a long time their smart cards even after they complete the procedure. It is, of course, due to the lack of technology to efficiently do so. In addition, there was only one way of knowing if their smart licenses had been issued: to visit the DoTM office and enquire.

['Lenovo A5s Review – A modest phone for a modest price'],"['Lenovo', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['February 14, 2019']",2019-02-14 08:59:10+00:00,"['With the prices of phones getting more premium and people getting less reluctant to pay for them, the budget segment is something that many companies might not invest in. But, there, still, exist some phones in the budget and entry-level devices. And  how much sense does this kind of phones make in 2019 ? Well, it remains to be seen. And so, the  Lenovo A5s  is a recent launch that has a price tag of less than $100, making it an entry level device. So, what does this phone bring to the table? And does it make sense to get a phone of this kind today? We tried to find out in this Lenovo A5s review.   Lenovo A5s Specifications:   Design : Plastic design with glossy finish, removable back  Display : 5.45″ IPS LCD, HD+ resolution (1440 x 720 pixels)  Rear Camera : 13 MP, Normal mode, HDR  Selfie Camera : 13 MP, Normal Mode, HDR  CPU : Quad-core MT6761 Helio A22 chipset  GPU : PowerVR GE8300  RAM : 2 GB  Storage : 16 GB onboard, expandable up to 128 GB via microSD  Battery : Removable 3100 mAh  Price : Rs.12,500   Design         In terms of design, the Lenovo A5s looks like a typical budget phone of today – with bezels and a chin. It has a  plastic body with a glossy finish , which makes it look good, actually. It does not look like a budget phone at first glance. You’ll only know that this is a budget phone because of its small size, and the single camera at the back.      Lenovo A5s Design   1  of 6               Glossy back         Removable back         Buttons         Headphone Jack         MicroUSB port         Bezels and Chin                              Plus, there is a weight to consider. This phone is very light on the hands, and since it is small in size, it is comfortable to hold as well. The glossy back will attract some fingerprints and smudges, but at this point, that’s nothing new in any kind of phones. The frame is metal, so, it can handle small drops and impacts. The  back is removable  and you can access the removable battery, Dual SIM, and a memory card. Overall, the design is appealing, considering this is a budget phone.  Display   The display here is a  5.45” IPS LCD panel  with  HD+ resolution  and an  18:9 aspect ratio . There are considerable bezels all around the device, but that doesn’t make the phone look unappealing.  The HD+ resolution on a display this size looks good enough. There is no visible pixelation. The viewing angles look good. Colors are not as punchy, neither do they stand out, but there is not much you can complain about this. It is bright enough to use under sunlight and harsh lighting, and there is a presence of  adaptive brightness feature  as well.  So, overall, it is an okay display.  Performance, Software, and Storage  The performance is the part which is make or break for budget phones. This phone packs a modest  quad-core Helio A22 chipset . Paired with  2 GB RAM , the performance is as expected from this one.  Day to day tasks can run okay, but apps like Messenger, Instagram and YouTube can take a while to open up. Multi-tasking is not very good, and switching between apps is not seamless. With multiple tabs in your messenger, you can notice the sluggishness. In addition, it cannot keep the apps open in the background for very long.  As for games, you cannot play high-end games all that well. You won’t be able to play Asphalt 9 as it’s not even available in the PlayStore for this phone. However,  PUBG is playable  in the lowest settings and with a very minimal amount of lags and stutters. Normal low-end games can run okay, though.  The phone runs on the  latest Android Pie , and so the User Experience is pretty smooth. I feel like the less RAM is the bottleneck for the device to perform as smooth as it can.  As for the storage, there is only  16 GB onboard , but since there is a  microSD card slot  to expand the memory, that’s all well.  Camera  On the camera front, it has  single cameras of 13 MP , both at the back and front. And the images from the camera are what you would expect from a phone of this caliber.      Washed out colors   1  of 5                                                                    Most of the aspects on this one are good enough, but the colors appear a bit washed out. The color accuracy is there, but it’s not as punchy as I’d like it to be. The amount of details in the photos are acceptable, and definitely social media worthy. But don’t expect anything super high-quality, though. Let’s just say it packs enough details for you to take photos of your college notes and send it.      HDR Mode   1  of 3               HDR off         HDR on         HDR                     The autofocus takes a slight amount of time to get the subject in focus, but besides that, it works alright. The HDR mode does a good job, too. As good as you can expect from a phone at this price. In this mode, colors tend to be slightly punchier than normal ones.      Normal Image   1  of 4               Slow Autofocus         Normal Image 1         Normal Image 2         Normal Image 3                        However, there does not seem to be any other features on the camera. Maybe, because ours was a review unit we received pre-launch, it only has this “ Normal Mode ” option. Because, if not, the modes selection is just pointless!      Low Light images   1  of 6               Night Shot 1         Night Shot 2         Night shot 3         Low light          Night selfie         Night shot                              For nighttime images, you can’t expect very much either. The images will come out grainy, and won’t pack enough details. But this is actually somewhat better than I expected it to be.      Lenovo A5s Selfie samples   1  of 2               Selfie 1         Selfie 2                  The selfie camera has the same story. It clicks social media worthy pictures, but nothing that you can brag about. You might be able to see a good amount of details when the subject is up close, but the same can’t be said for every situation. Like I said, there seems to be  no portrait mode  – not even a software-based one. So, no bokeh pictures for you.  Video quality seems okay. Not something that you can vlog or such, but just good enough to capture some moments for you to watch later. And definitely post it in your social media.  Battery  As for the battery, you get a  3100 mAh unit , which is typical for a phone at this price. Due to the power efficient chipset, and a low-res screen, it will last for a day easily with your day to day usage. There is  no Fast Charging  of any kind, and it cannot be expected either. The phone takes  nearly 2 hours to charge fully  from an empty battery.  Verdict  Bottom line, for a $100 phone, this seems it is a device of decent value. There are very few options in this price range, and most of them revolve around Android Go. And you know, there are limitations to Android Go as well. But with this, you can get the full Android experience, which will not be very disappointing. Of course, you will have to cut some corners, but the price you pay for it is good enough.  Having said that, if you could add a few bucks, you can get phones like  Galaxy M10 ,  Realme C1 , and  Redmi 6  which are literally better in every aspect.

The Nova 4 is the latest iteration of the Nova-series from the company. And it was launched only over a month ago in the international market. Let’s find more about the Huawei Nova 4 along with its official price in Nepal here.   Huawei Nova 3 Overview  The Huawei Nova 4 was the first phone in Nepal to feature a punch-hole display. It had a tiny circular cut-out on the display to house the front camera. Most of the mid-range and flagship these days follow the trend of punch-hole display.        Design and Display  The Nova 4 has the same design and build to the Nova 3 -glass body with two-tone gradient coloring. But we can see more color options on this one. On that body, it flaunts a large  6.41″ bezel-less punch-hole Full HD+ display . Despite the popularity of in-display fingerprint sensors on high-level mid-rangers, this one sticks with a traditional rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. But that’s all well, they are faster and I like it more anyway.   Camera  The Nova 4 still packs 4 cameras. But this time, it has a single selfie camera and a triple camera setup at the back. The triple camera setup comprises of a  48 MP primary lens  with f/1.8 aperture, a  16 MP wide-angle lens  with f/2.2 aperture and a  2 MP depth sensor . But this variant is not available in Nepal. We will only get the variant with another camera setup comprising of  20 MP + 16 MP + 2 MP . The rear camera setup does well under properly lit condition but the image processing on this one is slow. The front features a  25 MP selfie camera . And of course, these cameras will be AI integrated which phone companies love so much these days.   Performance and Memory  Inside, the phone runs on  Huawei’s Kirin 970 chipset  with  8 GB RAM .\xa0 The RAM on this device is based on  LPDDR4X  technology. There is 128GB memory on board and you can’t expand it as there’s no microSD card slot. While the performance will still be snappy, I felt that they should’ve gone with the latest Kirin 980 instead. guess, they were trying to save their beast of a chipset for flagships only. In our review, we didn’t encounter any hiccups while using the phone, and we even managed to play PUBG at its high setting without facing any issue.  Battery and others  On the software end, the device comes with EMUI 9.0.1 based on Android Pie. We found the custom skin well-optimized thus resulting in a smoother experience. But the UI does com with bloatware. For security, the device comes with a capacitative fingerprint sensor mounted on the back. It also supports Face unlock. The phone comes with\xa0a  3750 mAh battery  that supports  18W fast charging .

"['Digital Kagaj Review – A good way to save paper, but could have been better!']","['Gadget', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['February 12, 2019']",2019-02-12 10:34:16+00:00,"['Digital Kagaj is something that looks more like a concept of a product for something bigger. This is something that is very simple and minimalistic and doesn’t do much. It is as advertised – just a digital paper that you, well…write on, nothing more.   Design and Display  As this is something that does not do much, the design is also pretty simple. It’s this big black slab of plastic material with some thickness to it. It looks like a mini black-board of sorts, the ones that used to be in schools. And the functionality is also about pretty much the same.\xa0        It is made out of  all plastic  and might give the impression of a tablet on first glance. The button on the top makes it look more like a tablet. But let me assure you, it is nothing but a slab to write on. The button on top acts as an eraser of sorts – it is a delete button. There’s a slot to keep the stylus at the back and a battery slot right beside it. However, this one doesn’t have any kind of rechargeable feature. This is just your regular battery that promises up to  100,000 writings  on it.      Digital Kagaz    1  of 2               Battery slot         stylus slot                  The construction looks pretty durable too even though it’s all plastic. It does flex quite a bit when pressure is applied, but not to the point it will break. Of course, if you do it forcefully, it will break…but this means that it can handle your everyday abuse. It is also pretty lightweight, weighing  less than 200 grams . So, very easy to carry, too.  The stylus looks like a cheap pen and is very lightweight too. But the stylus is nothing but a pen-shaped plastic, anyway. As it has no internal mechanism or anything. You can also easily write with any pointed object, like your nails, or something like that. So, even if you lose the stylus, there’s nothing to worry about. And this device can  only write in green . There are no color options available, for now. But if it did have them, that would be quite interesting.  The  display is LCD . And by the display, I mean the part which you write on. It is not a “real display”. However, it is pressure sensitive, so, you can apply different levels of pressure to write in various styles too. The display is resistant to bright lights, so, you can also use it in the sun. But due to the lack of any kind of screen lighting mechanism, it cannot be used all that much in dark environments.  Also, this thing is  not water-proof , so, be careful in the rain…or just keep it away from water.  Usage and Performance  Talking about the usage and such, I have already said quite a few times that it doesn’t do much. After all, it’s technically a paper. So, this is something you primarily use to pass the time. I, mostly played “Tic-tac-toe” on it, just for the heck of it. And while we used to waste paper for that, now, we don’t need to!  But this is also a  good way to get kids engaged  in stuff. You can teach them alphabets, or numbers, calculations or drawings and stuff. If your kids like to just scribble on paper, this will also be a relief. It will reduce the paper wastage and be less messy around the house, too. Plus, it is a great alternative to getting kids hooked to mobile phones from an early age.  This can, also, be a  good utility for students . It can serve as a way to do rough calculations or scribble notes in rough for memorizing. It can come in handy while doing maths, as you don’t have to keep doing it in the corners of your notebook, or do it on the table and rub it off later. Plus, this can be used in small restaurants to take orders from customers without wasting paper!\xa0  For office workers, it can be a way to  keep track of everyday tasks . It is a better alternative to those sticky notes which you have to stick on your walls and look untidy. But for those of us, who work only on their computers, or laptops, this may not be very useful. For people like us, we even have sticky notes in our laptops itself. So…this is for those, who are not on their computers 24 / 7.  In addition, this is a  good tool for designers as  well. If you need to provide a rough layout for the designs, this is a good way to do so. And if you like to simply doodle on, then, you can do that too.\xa0  The  major drawback is the lack of an eraser . There is a delete button, but when you press it, everything on it will be deleted. If this only had an eraser or a one-step undo button, it would be much more practical for designers and artists as well. And not only them, but it would be practical for everyone. Because, if you just make a single mistake, then, you have to delete everything! And that is very impractical…so, an eraser would make a big difference!  Also, this one has got  no storage of any kind . It is only a simple writing page. You cannot store anything in it, you have to take pictures of it. There is a lock button on the bigger model, which when triggered can  prevent accidentally erasing  the contents as well. So, if you are doing something important, you can use that.  Conclusion      Digital Kagaz sizes   1  of 2               8.5-inch model         10-inch model                  This Digital Kagaj is priced at  Rs.1950 for the bigger 10-inch model  and  Rs.1450 for the smaller 8.5-inch model . Maybe, they could have included a storage mechanism, but that would make it more expensive and a different device altogether.  However, this is a very good concept, with the objective of “ Say Goodbye to Paper “. And what I think is, this is still in its starting phase. You can purchase it commercially, but what I want to see is a full-fledged digital copy with storage, so that you can write notes on it, and can replace your whole notebook. And we can save more paper!  But for now, as it stands, this is also a great product for casual usage. It is a great concept, and I like it quite a bit. What do you think of it, do let us know. And if you can think of any other practical usages, do let us know that too!

The  Galaxy M10  is available from offline stores and select online e-commerce platforms like Daraz, Sastodeal, and Smartdoko. It is available in 2GB RAM and 16GB storage configuration.\xa0The Galaxy M10 is priced at Rs.13,290. For the price, the Galaxy M10 should be one of the best budget phones of 2019, at least in Nepal.   Samsung Galaxy M10 Overview  The Galaxy M10 features a tall  6.2-inch 720P display  with a  teardrop notch . Unlike most of Samsung phones out there, this phone doesn’t come with an AMOLED display. Samsung has included an  IPS LCD panel  on this device. So there won’t be the punchy blacks. But considering the price, you cannot expect more.         Talking about the cameras, the phone flaunts a  dual-camera setup at its back . Dual-camera is a rare feature at this price range. So the Galaxy M10 surely has solid ground on the camera department. And as the secondary shooter on this device captures a wide field of view, it offers greater versatility than most of the budget and mid-range devices out there. For the selfies, there is a  5MP snapper  tucked neatly on the notch up top.   Powering the device is  Exynos 7870 processor  backed with  2GB of RAM . You also get  16GB of onboard memory  to store all of your files and photos. There is also a  dedicated SD card slot  with which users can expand the storage further.  On to the software side, you get the  Android Oreo  with  Experience UI  on the top. But Samsung has already released an update for the device. So you can readily  update the device to Android Pie . You can also get  One UI  treat on the top. A decent-sized  3400mAh battery  keeps the device running.

How soon you ask? Reports claim the smartphone will get an official launch sometime around the first week of March. The phone codenamed  CPH1969 , or the OPPO F11 Pro has been in the rumor mill for a while, but today we have an official render to share.  Starting off at the back, this iteration boasts a  48MP CMOS sensor . It’s the same concept as on the Redmi Note 7 Pro, capturing 12MP photos + pixel binning for the 48MP end result. The front gets a  32MP  pop-up\xa0camera. The display will stretch\xa0to the top, with\xa0the earpiece embedded into the bezel. There is a minimal bezel at the bottom.  The same 48MP sensor is rumored to be a part of Vivo V15 Pro’s specs sheet as well. The pop-up camera should be interesting at this point in time, especially for a mid-ranger. The fingerprint sensor lies below the rear cameras, ideally to reduce the use of face recognition.        At this point, if it wasn’t going to come with a pop-up camera, we could expect the fingerprint to be long gone. Sadly this also means no in-display fingerprint sensor, a feature already present on the Vivo V11 Pro.\xa0The top of the line configuration will feature  6GB  of RAM and  128GB  of storage.  Furthermore, like the F9 Pro, the F11 Pro will sport fast charging for the beefy  4500mAh  battery through a  USB-C  port.

RTX provides a hefty bump over its predecessor, the GTX1060, and is almost as powerful as the GTX 1070. That’s with the Ray-Tracing and DLSS out of the equation. Let’s look at a few pointers as to why buying any of these three laptops is a good deal.  Nepali pricing  Nepali consumers are familiar with paying a premium for laptops if purchased from the official channels. That’s not exactly the case here, the prices are pretty well put together, unlike what the history suggests. There is a slight chance these prices might be unbeatable, combine that with the perks of buying from an official channel, can we argue with that?  The RTX GPU  Now, international pricing aside, RTX GPUs are pretty powerful. They are overpriced for sure, but it’s a well thought out graphics processor that should get better with time. Rumors of the new DLSS update hints at a 50% more in-game fps and that is huge. Even without the update, the RTX 2060 can easily tackle the likes of GTX 1070, while the RTX 2070 takes on the GTX 1080. With more games soon to support ray-tracing and more optimizations, we should see RTX GPUs show their full potential in the coming months.  Also Read:  Dell laptops price in Nepal  Competitors in Nepal  I looked around the current laptop market in Nepal, and the cheapest laptops with a GTX 1070 I could find was over 2 lakhs. And those laptops only come with 7th gen processors, while this one gets an 8th Gen i7 processor, with more cores, more threads, and a higher clock speeds. Combine both and you get even better frame rates on games, faster renders, and overall better user experience.  Conclusion  These laptops are worth their asking price. Sure, for over 2 lakhs they better be worth it. The compelling factor here remains its prices and the high cost of GTX 1070 equipped laptops in Nepal. If you live somewhere in the US, the same might not apply.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MSI-RTX-laptops.jpg']

The  P20 pro  had dazzled everyone with a triple camera set up and now Huawei is all set to bring on another P- series device. The Huawei P30 and P30 Pro, as far as the rumors go, are coming in the market at the end of March!   Huawei’s P- lineup smartphones are their flagship that they roll out once a year, focussing primarily on cameras and looks. Last year’s  P20 Pro  made a lot of buzz in the tech community. And this time, it’s not only going to be two of them but three, which will most likely be named Huawei P30 Lite, P30 and P30 Pro! The light version of the device is said to have mid-range specs whereas, the other two, like usual will be flagships!        Not meaning to be sassy, but sounds to me something already being done by iPhones.  Rumors also confirm that the Huawei will be holding a press meet later in March to announce it’s next P- series smartphone. Like the predecessor models, the devices to launch are going to feature power-packed\xa0cameras. Similarly, the devices will also have an additional ToF sensor alongside the triple camera setup. Both the P30 and P30 Pro will have sensors from Sony in their phones. Additionally, the phone is said to feature a periscope for delivering higher optical zoon experience.   Also, we are expecting the  Kirin 980  to fuel this device like the Mate series. The P30 and P30 Pro may have different RAM variants though, with the P30 rumored to have 8 GB and P30 Pro having up to 12 GB of RAM. And since the  Mate 20 Pro  featured an in- display fingerprint sensor, the P30 pro might also have one!  The devices are likely to come in March so, we won’t probably be seeing them in MWC this year.

When the 700-series were announced, they promised 2 times the AI performance and 30% more power efficiency over the existing 600-series. And fast forward to today, we only have a Snapdragon 710 in that category, which we can find in mid-range devices of today. With the Snapdragon 712, we now have one more…but it doesn’t add anything except to what we already have.\xa0  The Snapdragon 712 has the same architecture, the same fabrication, and everything. The only difference is that the 712 provides a 100 MHz more clock speed, making it  2.3 GHz  from the 710’s 2.2 GHz. Qualcomm says that the  712 is 10% faster than the 710 . And I doubt that kind of performance boost is even noticeable. So…not very exciting stuff, is it?  Source: Wikipedia  The only thing that can be considered an upgrade is the support for  QuickCharge 4.0+ . With this, at least, the charging time on phones will decrease considerably. Besides that, everything is the same.        It is still based on the  10 nm technology , with 8 cores –  two 2.3 GHz Kyro 360 Gold Cortex-A75 cores  and  six 1.7 GHz Kyro 360-Silver Cortex A-55 cores . Also, it features the same  Adreno 616  as GPU and Hexagon 685 DSP. Just like it’s predecessor, i.e. the 710, it integrates the  Qualcomm X15 LTE modem  too. So, this is all the same. There’s nothing new. At all.  But still, with its small added benefits, it will be used in the upcoming mid-range devices. But honestly, I do not see any considerable benefit in this one. So, if the upcoming mid-range devices are going to include this chipset, then, they better provide other compelling features as well. Else, any older phone with a Snapdragon 710 is good enough and there will be no need to upgrade to the 712.  The Snapdragon 712 will be available by the first quarter of 2019.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/snapdragon-712.jpg']

The company’s G-series, more specifically, is one of the go-to smartphones for someone looking for top-quality specifications in a budget price tag.  The Lenovo-owned company announced four new smartphones today, all following the same ‘moto’ I mentioned above. The new members of the G-series, the Moto G7 Play, G7 Power, G7, and G7 Plus all add up to Motorola’s answer to the budget segment for 2019.  Moto G7 Play         The Moto G7 Play is the cheapest of the four smartphones that were unveiled today. It has a 5.7-inch HD+ display with a large notch located at the top. The phone is made out of plastic and comes with a little chin up front. For performance, Motorola has included the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor coupled with 2 GB of RAM and Adreno 506 GPU.  In terms of optics, the Moto G7 Play features a single 13-megapixel rear-facing camera and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. For storage purpose, this device packs in 32 GB of internal memory with an option to expand. There is a 3,000 mAh battery inside. The Moto G7 Plus will ship with Android v9.0 Pie out of the box.

According to Motorola, this battery will last for about 72 hours on a single charge. It is also supported by the company’s TurboPower charging. The G7 Power sports a 6.2-inch HD+ display with a notch on top. Even though the HD display certainly helps the battery last longer, the fact that the display has such lower resolution is a bummer.  The Moto G7 Power is powered by 3 GB of RAM and the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset. The device has a base storage of 32 GB with support for external memory. For camera purpose, the G7 Power has a single 12-megapixel sensor on the rear with the same 8-megapixel front camera. This phone also runs on Android Pie.

The camera sensor and the choice of the chipset differentiate the two devices.  The Moto G7 has a tall 6.2-inch full HD+ display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. On top is a water-drop notch with a chin on the bottom. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset powers the smartphone with Motorola claiming the G7 to be 50% faster than the G6. The phone comes with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage that is expandable with a microSD card. Unlike the G7 Play, the G7 has a glass back making it look and feel more premium than the rest. On the back lie dual 12-megapixel and 5-megapixel cameras that have a couple of AI-capabilities. There is a 3,000 mAh battery on the phone that is fast charging enabled.  The Moto G7 Plus, on the other hand, has a dual 16- and 5-megapixel. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset which is similar to the 632.  Moto G7 and G7 Plus Specifications   Display:  6.2-inch IPS LCD HD+  CPU:  Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 632  GPU: \xa0Adreno 506 on G7 / 509 on G7 Plus  Operating System: \xa0Android v9.0 Pie  RAM:  4 GB  Storage:  64 GB expandable up to 512 GB  Rear Primary Camera:\xa0  12 MP, f/1.8 aperture on G7; 16 MP, f/1.7 aperture on G7 Plus  Rear Secondary Camera:  5 MP, f/2.2 aperture, depth sensor  Front Camera:\xa0 8 MP on G7 / 12 MP on G7 Plus  SIM (s):  Single/Dual Nano SIM  Sensors: \xa0Fingerprint, Gyro, accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery:  Non-removable 3,000 mAh battery, with fast charging  Price of Moto G7:   $300   Price of Moto G7 Plus: $340   Verdict  When Motorola came up with its G-series smartphones a few years ago, the devices that were launched then were groundbreaking. Everyone loved the handsets and no other manufacturer could compete with the phones in their respective price segment.  However, since Lenovo took over Motorola, I have been constantly disappointed with what the Chinese company is offering. While other manufacturers have improved and made amends in the budget segment to launch their flagship killing devices, it seems like Motorola is still living in the shadow of its previously popular G-series smartphones. Even the devices launched today, are far from what the competitors are currently offering. And as a fan of the G-series from Motorola, it is certainly sad to see how Motorola has turned up.

['Lava R5 Full review: A glamor phone that still does a good job'],"['Lava', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 7, 2019']",2019-02-07 07:22:54+00:00,"['Although the Indian smartphone maker Lava hasn’t gained that much of popularity in the smartphone bazaar, their bar and feature phones are quite renowned in the market. And at the time when Chinese smartphone companies are tussling to gain the market share especially in the budget and midrange price bracket, Lava brought  Lava R5  as a contender in the competition. But has the company bundled enough features to please the smartphone audiences? We tried to find out in this Lava R5 review.   Lava R5 Specifications   Display: \xa06.22 inches IPS display  Resolution:\xa0 HD+ (720 x 1520 pixels) with 19:9 aspect ratio  Chipset: \xa0MediaTek Helio P22 MT6762  CPU: \xa0Octa-core (4 x2.0GHz Cortex A53 + 4 x1.5Ghz Cortex A53)  GPU: \xa0PowerVR GE8320, 650MHz  OS: \xa0Star OS 5.1 based on Android 8.1  RAM: \xa04GB LPDDR4X  Onboard Storage: \xa064GB; Expandable via Micro SD card  Front camera: \xa016 MP, f/2.0, 2μm, Portrait lighting  Rear camera: \xa013+5 MP, f/2.0, Dual-LED flash  Security:\xa0 Fingerprint sensor, Face Unlock  Battery: \xa03260 mAh Non-removable battery; 10W charging  Color Options : Black and Blue  Price : Rs. 22,999   Also Read:  Lava Mobiles Price in Nepal        Design  So, Let’s start the things with the design. Although the back is made of plastic, I quite liked the device’s sleek look and feel. It’s also easy to hold and feels comfortable to use. It is equipped with a glossy plastic, which gives the vibe of a glass material. So, the looks of the Lava R5 is somewhat appealing.   The frame on this device is also plastic, so it got me a little bit concerned about its durability. Even in my 1 week of use, it already got some scratches on its back.  But despite the presence of the plastic back and plastic frame, it doesn’t bend and there were no any sorts of creaks. So there is nothing to worry yet.  Display  On the display side, the Lava R5 comes with a tall 6.2-inch IPS panel with a 19:9 aspect ratio. And yes, there is a notch, which is wide and very obtrusive. So I didn’t quite like the notch on it. If you also hate wide notches like I do, you can always go through the settings and hide the notch.   So, coming back to what I didn’t like about this display is the resolution. Now, this phone costs some Rs.23000 and it has got an HD+ display. This might partially be due to the fact that the chipset that’s running on this phone supports only HD+ display.  And with all the HD+ display on a big 6.2-inch panel, one can see some pixelation on close inspection. So, the sharpness is just okay at best. Having said that, all the other aspects of the display are quite good.  I quite like the color accuracy; the viewing angle is decent and the brightness is ample with good sunlight legibility. Even on the broad light, I was able to easily view the contents on the screen. Since the phone also has an ambient light sensor on the board, you don’t have to adjust the brightness on the screen every now and then. Also, you get a gorilla glass 3 which is good to see on budget phones.  Performance  Performance has never been the strong suit of Lava phones. And the Lava R5 is no exception on that respect. The phone comes with MediaTek Helio P22 chipset, which is an average processor for the price. But Lava has shown its generosity by providing 4GB of LPDDR4X RAM. Since the budget smartphones usually come with a relatively sluggish DDR3 RAM, the LPDDR4X RAM adds quite a fluidity on the performance. And talking about the storage, the device boasts 64GB of onboard memory, which can be further expanded with a dedicated SD card slot.  So, with a combination of an average chipset and DDR4 RAM, the device performed accordingly. It ran smoothly while performing day to day tasks. Minor apps and games ran smoothly without any hiccups. Multitasking and switching between the apps hadn’t been a problem either. The performance, however, was not the same while playing graphics-intensive games. PUBG was playable only at low settings, and when changed to medium settings, I faced some lags and stutters. So, I can say that if you are more into the heavy games, the Lava R5 may not please you much.  Software  On the software side, you get Android Oreo 8.1 out of the box with a Lava’s Star OS skin on top. Lava has promised a Pie update sometime in Q2 of this year. On to the UI, you get a lot of bloatware on first boot, but you can delete it hassle-free.   Other than that, There is nothing to talk much about the software here. The UI is clean and functional just like any other android phones out there.  Camera  Now let’s move on to the camera. The Lava R5 features a dual camera setup with a 13MP primary shooter backed by a 5MP depth sensor. With the dual camera on the board, the device can capture the portrait images.   And if you ask me, I was quite impressed with what Lava R5 had to offer on the portrait front. The phone captured some amazing portrait images with proper edge detection. And the blurs look natural. Even if you are not yet satisfied with the intensity of blur, you can readjust it quite easily even after taking the pictures. However, the portraits are inconsistency while capturing in the low light. It quite lacked the sharpness along with proper edge detection. So, if you are taking a portrait image, make sure there is enough light at the disposal. Normal images were rather more impressive. They pack a substantial amount of details and reproduces a\xa0fair amount of color accuracy. But you may notice a warm tone in some images, which is nothing serious though. However, low light images were quite lacked that punch. I noticed a substantial amount of loss in details in the low light images. Noises and grains, however, were quite minimal.

The large 2-micrometer pixel size of the selfie shooter captures sufficient light so the selfie on the whole packs great amount of details with an absolute vibrancy.

Since it’s all due to the software intelligence, results are not always great. And it also takes some time to process and save the images, which can be frustrating at times. But if you capture selfies in ample light with steady hands, you have good chances to capture some decent portrait selfies.  For high-resolution images,  click here .  Security  Security wise, the phone has packed a Fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock feature as a biometric authentication tool in addition to all the basic forms of security. The fingerprint on the device is really fast and accurate. It unlocks the device almost instantly. But the Face Unlock feature is not really that fast. It also fails to detect the face and to unlock the device in dark scenarios. So fingerprint sensor basically had been my primary tool to unlock the device since it was more reliable.  Battery  Now, let’s talk about the battery. Lava has equipped a 3260mAh battery on this device, which doesn’t sound so great when compared with  Samsung Galaxy M20 ’s 5000mAh battery and 4000mAh batteries on the  Redmi phones . But despite the relatively smaller capacity of the battery, the backup on the device was rather appreciable.   The phone backed me for more than a day on the normal use. Since the phone has a low-res display and a power-efficient chipset, the device didn’t consume much battery. That’s why I always had 25% or more juice left on my phone at the end of the day. So I am fairly pleased with the backup. Charging the phone was not that bad either. The phone comes with a 10-Watt micro USB charger on the box, which takes around 1 and half hour to get the device fully charged.  Conclusion  In the present context, the  Redmi Note 5 AI  is definitely the budget king in Nepal. It has got a Full-HD+ display, a big battery, and more importantly a capable SD 636 chipset, which is lacking on the Lava R5.  However, on our test, the Lava R5 outperformed the Note 5 AI on the camera department. We found images from both the front and back cameras to be better on the R5. So, if you want a better camera, especially the selfie one, the Lava R5 would probably be a good choice.  But there is still more work to do. We hope Lava will come with better smartphones in the future with a capable chipset, high-res display, and maybe a bigger battery?

The phones are expected to be named the Realme 3 and the Realme A1.  Realme 3  The Realme 3 will be a successor to the already-popular  Realme 2 Pro . The 3 could be a good buy for anyone looking for a decent mid-range smartphone. The Realme 3 is rumored to pack in the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 processor. It will probably house dual 16 and 2-megapixel rear-facing cameras with a 25-megapixel selfie snapper up front. The Realme 3 will have some design improvements over the Realme 2 Pro. The major talking point about this phone might be VOOC charging, as it could be the first Realme smartphone to come with Oppo’s fast-charging enabled.  Realme A1  There are a few rumors stating that the Realme 3 will launch alongside the Realme A1. This device will start a new A-series for the company. The A1 will definitely feature a tall display that surrounds a water drop notch. It will be powered by an octa-core processor clocked at 1.8 GHz. This processor will be aided by 2 or 3 GB of RAM. The phone will be available in a 32 GB storage variant with support for external memory. On the optics side of things, the Realme A1 will probably equip dual 13- and 2-megapixel cameras on the rear, with an 8-megapixel selfie shooter. All of this could be backed up by a large 4,200 mAh battery. We are yet to see how Realme plans to run its smartphone market this year, as the to-be-launched A1 is somewhat similar to the  Realme C1 .

The company seems to market the device in regards to the display and cameras using hashtags like #CatchTheMoment and #MaxVisionDisplay.   In accordance with the hashtags, we see an 18:9 display, that Lenovo calls Max View Display with  HD+ Screen   resolution . Likewise, at the back, the design is made of plastic with a glossy finish. The back is removable, so there is a battery inside which is pretty uncommon these days. And as it used to be before, we have two SIM slots and an SD card inside.

The last time we checked, it was the  Coolpad Cool Play 6  and since then, we have heard no more. While the company has been launching new handsets internationally, we have not seen one for a long time in Nepal and rumors were that the company was selling products at a liquidated price in the country. But lately, there is news that a new device from Coolpad may launch very soon. It’s called Coolpad Cool 3, which is an entry-level smartphone.  In terms of specifications, the device is 5.7 inches tall and comes with a dewdrop notch, like the ones in OPPO and Vivo phones.         The display is an IPS LCD\xa0with 1520 x 720 pixels screen resolution. And this might be one of the cheapest phones with a dewdrop notch. Performance wise, we see something unusual here. The device has an octa-core entry-level processor from Unisoc, which was previously known as Spreadturn. It packs 2 GB of RAM and a total of 16 GB internal storage and you can expand the capacity further via a microSD card.

It features a 6.41″ AMOLED FHD+ display with a 91% screen to body ratio and 19.5:9 aspect ratio. There is also a Gorilla Glass 5 protection on top.

The 15th anniversary marks the 15th year of conversion of the Government into a company. And to develop the company further, NTC will also focus on the following areas from now on.   Broadband services from 4G LTE and FTTH  Quality and capacity improvement  Scientific business promotion and expansion of NTC services  Revenue increment   Also Read:\xa0 NTC Winter Offers  NTC 15th Anniversary Offers  To mark the 15th anniversary, NTC now has various kinds of offers. And most of these offers are already live since Feb 5, but, most of the offers have limited validity.        \xa0  NT Mobile App  The first offer is on the download of the NT mobile app. NTC users who download and register their number via the mobile app will get a  100 MB of all-time data for free . One more reason to download the app!  GSM Postpaid offer  NTC’s previous Rs.900 pack offer has been revises. Users would get about 2 GB data and Rs.500 free resource (i.e. to do what users please for the amount) previously, but now, the pack will provide you  3.3 GB of data  and  Rs.500 free resource .  With the increase in data pack consumers, this should be a good incentive.  NTC Tourist App  Now, tourists who visit Nepal can also get a good package to suit their needs while they stay in the country. There are two variants to this pack.  The  Rs.500 pack  will get tourists 5 GB Data, 50 mins of Voice call, 50 SMS and Rs.100 of free resource international calls. Also, there’s  Rs.1000 pack  that gets you twice the services – 10 GB data, 100 min voice call, 100 SMS and Rs.200 of international calls. However, the SMS and voice calls are limited only within the NTC mobile network.  Data Bonus for Vision Impaired  On the recommendation of\xa0 Netra-hin Sangh,\xa0 the company will also offer  various incentives to the visually impaired  who subscribe to data packs on the NT network. It will provide 100% bonus to those people on the purchase of Rs.50, Rs.200 and Rs.300 data packs. A 50% bonus will also apply to a subscription of Rs.200 voice pack.  This offer is valid for 90 days, from the time of this article.  Bonus on MPOS recharge  There is also a  5% bonus on the recharge through MPOS  (Mobile Point of Sale). So, if you want a small bonus, then, you can visit the stores with MPOS devices. This is a good way to get people to recharge their phones without using recharge cards and such.  FTTH Migration  Furthermore, NTC is also providing an incentive for ADSL users to switch to their FTTH services. The company will provide FTTH CPE devices (Customer Premises Equiment, i.e. router or modems) for free if anyone has been using ADSL for more than a year and wants to switch to FTTH. It will be provided if the customer switches to FTTH and pre-pays a bill of 3 months.  Soft Launch of Roaming Service  In addition to the various offers aforementioned, NTC also did a “soft-launch” of its Roaming services.  Roaming services refer to that which enables customers to use the mobile network outside the teritorry of the home country. It allows users to use their own number for voice calls, SMS and data so that they don’t have to switch out SIMs. It is very useful for those who have to keep traveling internationally frequently for business or trade or tourism.  Just to be clear, this service has already been available since 2001 and is usable with about 192 different mobile operators among 86 countries. But there have been some adjustments, and pre-paid roaming service has been started.  Postpaid customers initially had to deposit Rs.30,000 to use the Roaming service, but from 1st of January, 2019, the amount has been  dropped to Rs.10,000 .  For prepaid customers, there is  no need for any kind of deposit . They can use their mobile balance for outbound roaming service. For now, this service will first come to neighboring countries – India and China. Hence the “soft-launch”. And so, there is no complete information on how to enable this service as of yet. After the full-fledged launch, the service will be usable by the public.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ntc-15-anniversary-1.jpg']

There is really no other piece of gadget that tends to excite the masses. The money, research, development, and attention that goes to these devices are outstanding, and unlike anything, we have seen before. So, it’s only natural to get excited about what the best and brightest manufacturers have in store for us.  Samsung  Right off the bat, they will be releasing two of the most anticipated smartphones of 2019. The first is their  Galaxy S10 Trio , which we know almost everything about. The phones are set to launch on February 20, right before MWC. The other is none other than the Galaxy Note 10, which like every year is expected to dominate the second half of 2019. Both phones carry huge expectations from the users, shareholders, and reviewers in general.         They have already kicked off 2019 with a few models from the  M-series . And the same will continue throughout the year more from the M series, a few from the  A-series , the 5G enabled S10+ and possibly a  foldable smartphone  soon. Samsung did change\xa0its patterns and trends to meet the market demands, so we will have to wait and see if they come up with more exciting stuff.  Sony  Sony has been in the rumor mill quite a lot lately. Be it them axing their compact lineup, their failing smartphone business or getting dumped by retailers and carriers. Either way, their phones in past weren’t exactly great, to begin with, either. But now, things are seemingly beginning\xa0to look up, at least the  Xperia XZ4 , which seems a lot promising. The phone sports the\xa0 SD 855 SoC , 6GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable memory.   It also gets a 4400mAh battery and a tall 21:9 AMOLED display up front. But the show stealer remains its 52MP f/1.6 aperture sensor, along with a 16MP telephoto lens and a 0.3MP ToF sensor. The pricing remains undisclosed, and the phone will also not go not sale before mid-summer even with an early MWC launch. As for the rest of 2019, Sony’s future remains in the dark.  Nokia   HMD Global is preparing the launch of their newest flagship, the Nokia 9 PureView. It is\xa0all but confirmed to come with a five-camera setup at the back. Ignoring the fact that it just looks disgusting in the renders, the Nokia 9 will also come with a 5.99″ punch hole display. The\xa0phone will run on  Snapdragon 845  instead of the  855 , the later is said to release\xa0later this year. The flagship will be followed by the Nokia 6.2 2019 and possibly a few others. One of which could be a refresh to its iconic\xa0feature phone.  HTC   HTC has stayed pretty much quiet in 2018, but we have a few rumors hinting at a new smartphone launch from the company. It won’t be a flagship, the HTC U13 or whatever they end up calling, that will come out later this year. They are, however, refreshing their  HTC U12 Life  with more RAM and storage options among other improvements. The company has claimed to come up with more smartphones in 2019 but failed to mention what we could expect.  LG   LG G8 or the LG V50 ThinQ will launch this February\xa024, on the first day of MWC 2019. Though we are just spitting out the highly likely scenario, the video above does help. Going by the “goodbye\xa0touch”, it definitely\xa0feels like LG is bringing something new to the scene. Rumors have it that it will feature the Snapdragon 855 SoC, vapor cooling chamber, 4000mAh battery and a 4K LCD sound emitting display.  Huawei   As you have already guessed from the image above, Huawei is launching a foldable smartphone at the MWC this year. And yes, the same phone will also come with 5G connectivity, as confirmed by Huawei itself. Moreover, the Huawei P30 could also make its way to this year’s MWC 2019. This one is rumored to feature the  Kirin 980 , three or four camera setup and an in-display fingerprint sensor.  OnePlus   We know when the OnePlus 7 is launching, maybe not the specific dates, but definitely somewhere in the month of May. Besides that, they are bringing a new smartphone, it may just be the  OnePlus 6T  but with 5G enabled. We are also not sure if it’s the OnePlus 6T, all we know is the phone OnePlus is about to announce at the event will come with 5G. Also, it won’t be cheap either, thanks to the 5G premium it will be carrying.  Motorola   Yup, Motorola Razr V4 foldable smartphone might make its way to the MWC this year. It’s not confirmed yet, but the phone was rumored to launch in February, so why not in MWC. Details on the phone remain a mystery, other than it’s foldable nature. What we can say for sure if it’s going to be an expensive phone, for sure. They are hosting an event on February\xa07, in Brazil and it’s highly likely the new  G7 series  will launch then.  OPPO   Finally, OPPO is also set to announce a foldable smartphone at the MWC 2019. Most OPPO smartphones never make its way out of its home country, but this might be an exception. It’s rumored to go available worldwide, though specifics are yet to be revealed. Other rumors hint at an OPPO phone with that 10x optical zoom lens to go official soon, alongside its  F11 series . We could also see a  Find X  successor this year as well, rumored to be named the OPPO Find Z.  VIVO   Vivo Apex 2019  was announced a few weeks ago, with a full display fingerprint sensor and 5G connectivity. While that may just be a concept and might not ship, ever, the phone sports flagship grade internals and builds on the same minimal design. We can also expect to see the  Vivo V15 and V15 Pro  really soon, along with a  few smartphones from the Y series .  Xiaomi   Xiaomi has a plan of its own, broadening its product category into larger geography. In a statement from the company’s CEO, he said: “Only by winning in China, can we win in the rest of the world”. The company plans to regain its number one position in China within ten quarters, which started by the first quarter of 2018. With that, we should see the second iteration of the  Pocophone  alongside the MI 9, MI A3, MI Mix 4 and a foldable Xiaomi smartphone.\xa0Furthermore, the rest of the smartphones from the  Redmi 7  series should go official in the coming weeks as well.  Apple   The  iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max  were launched back in September last year, and we can expect the same from them in 2019 as well. While their innovation has taken quite a hit, we remain optimistic about their next flagships. Their sales have been uninspiring as well, countering which, the  iPhone X  seems to have made a comeback. The 64GB variant of the iPhone X is currently available in their refurbished section for $130 less. With all this happening, don’t be surprised if the iPhone makers come up with another new smartphone mid-2019.  Google   Google’s  Pixel 3 duo  was a hit for the minority and a miss for the majority. Flawed with endless hardware and software bugs, the device failed to gain much momentum. However, its cameras were unmatched and the UI experience was highly loved. The same features should carry on to their new Pixel 3 Lite XL.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyJwQwSpgWM  The phone was recently leaked sporting an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. Their launch dates pricing will be revealed soon, but going by the rumors, they will carry a reasonable price. As for the Pixel 4 family, we will have to wait till\xa0October.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UPCOMING-SMARTPHONES-OF-2019-1.jpg']

['Vivo Y95 Launched in Nepal amidst cut-throat competition'],['Vivo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['February 5, 2019']",2019-02-05 09:14:45+00:00,"['The Vivo Y95, which launched a few months back in November has made its way to Nepal. The Y95 is another latest extension to the company’s Y-series. Vivo’s Y-series were quite popular in Nepal too. So, here’s another one from Vivo, but I doubt it will be as popular as some others.  Overview  The  Vivo Y95  looks very similar to the  Vivo Y85 , but of course, this one should be a successor to that one. This phone packs the same  6.22″ HD+ IPS LCD display  and the same 19:9 aspect ratio. It packs a dual-camera setup, that comprises of a  13 MP primary camera  and a  2 MP depth sensor . The selfie camera has been bumped up to  20 MP , so, selfies should look better on this one.\xa0  Under the hood, this phone is powered by a  Snapdragon 439 chipset , which is a good upgrade over the Helio P22 of Y85. Also, it is backed by  4 GB RAM  – which again is similar to the Y85. It has  64 GB internal storage  and a large  4030 mAh battery . The storage is expandable via microSD for up to 256 GB as well.        So, by the looks of it, this phone appears very similar to the Y85. The considerable upgrades lie in the chipset and the selfie camera. Other than that…all else is the same, from the design to the display…except for its trendy water-drop notch up top!  The phone is priced at  Rs.28,390 …and at this price, it faces a lot of tough competition! Like, a lot… There’s  MI A2 ,  Huawei Y9 2019 , and  Realme 2 Pro ! This doesn’t look like a bad phone, but will it be able to withstand the competition?

['Samsung Galaxy M10 and M20 launching soon in Nepal'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 5, 2019']",2019-02-05 08:47:08+00:00,"['Lately, Samsung had been facing rants from tech bloggers and criticisms from the customer base for not bringing value for money devices and still sticking with the old processors. But the tech giants recently changed its antics. And they conceived the Galaxy M series devices targeting the millennials. They decided and made an effort to pack some decent specs into their latest devices and pricing them at relatively cheaper prices. And when they launched the  Samsung Galaxy M10 and M20 in India , it stirred the smartphone world quite a bit. The smartphones are going on sale in India starting from today. And the good thing is Samsung has also given their words to launch the devices very soon in Nepal.  Samsung Galaxy M10  When it comes to the budget price segment, we do not really see compelling devices. Budget and entry-level devices are packed with a ton of compromises. And the budget-conscious populace is often trapped with laggy processors, average displays, fast-draining batteries, and whatnots. So to break that trend, Samsung launched the  Galaxy M10  with somewhat decent specs for the price.         The phone comes with a 6.2-inch display with a 2.5D curved on the top. The display on the device has also been provided with a V-shaped notch. And the company’s proprietary names for such kind of displays is called as “Infinity V” display. On the resolution side, this infinity V display features HD+ resolution packing 269 pixels in every inch.  Talking about the performance, the phone is shepherded by an Exynos 7870 chipset. And the processor is coupled with 2/3GB of RAM to ensure fluidity in the performance. The device comes with 16/32GB of onboard storage to facilitate the users in storing files and photos. There is also a dedicated SD card slot to ease in expanding the storage further.   On the camera side of things, the phone boasts a dual camera setup at the back and a single selfie shooter on the front. The camera pair on the rear panel is a combination of 13MP and 5MP sensors: the primary is the wide-angle lens whereas the secondary one is an ultra-wide-angle. So you can already guess, the device has a somewhat wider scope of applications than the devices with a depth sensor on the secondary camera. With the secondary camera in action, users can expand the field-of-view up to 120-degrees in addition to taking portrait images.   On the front, there is a 5MP selfie shooter, which rests meticulously on the notch. In addition to taking normal pictures, the selfie cam on this device is also capable of taking portrait selfies.  Moving on to the battery, the phone comes equipped with a 3400mAh non-removable battery. With low-res display and power-efficient chipset on the board, we can expect the battery to provides a decent backup. Samsung has also said it has included optimization technics to enhance the battery life. So you may not have to plug the device to the charger every now and then.  Samsung Galaxy M10 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.2-inch IPS LCD display with 2.5D curved glass on the top  Resolution:\xa0 HD+ (720 x 1520 pixels) @ 269PPI  Chipset:  Samsung’s Exynos 7870  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53  GPU:\xa0 Mali-T830 MP1  RAM:\xa0 2/3GB  Storage:\xa0 16/32GB; Expandable via micro SD card (Dedicated slot)  OS:\xa0 Android 8.1 (Oreo) with Experience UI 9.5 on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual camera – 13MP wide-angle + 5MP ultra-wide-angle camera, LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 5MP  Sensors:\xa0 accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 3400mAh non-removable battery  Samsung Galaxy M10 Price in Nepal:  Rs. 13,790 (2+16)   Samsung Galaxy M20  The  Galaxy M20   is better of the two. But considering the specs and price of the device, it could easily be one of the  best budget devices at its price .  Going by the specs, the phone comes with a tall 6.3-inch infinity V display. The screen on this device is capped with 2.5D curved glass and enriched with Full-HD+ resolution. Talking about the performance, the phone boots with Exynos 7904 chipset enjoying 3/4GB RAM and 32/64GB of storage alongside. Just like the Galaxy M10, the M20 also comes with a dedicated SD card slot for storage expansion.   On the camera front, the device flaunts a 13MP primary shooter backed by a 5MP ultra-wide-angle camera. There is an 8MP shooter on the front dedicated for the selfies.   Battery is the biggest selling point of the Galaxy M20. It comes with a whopping 5000mAh battery with 15-watt fast charging support. A 5000mAh battery is already capable of providing a prolong backup. On the top, there is Samsung’s extra intelligence to enhance the battery life further. So it may not be any surprise if the handset turns out to be the smartphone with best battery life for its price.   Talking about the software, the device comes with Android Oreo out of the box just like the Galaxy M10. The software is flavored with Samsung’s Experience UI on the top. Although the presence of an old version of the software is disappointing, Samsung has also promised to roll out Android Pie update with One UI on both the devices some time in August.

And it will not take very long for the devices to land in Nepal. Samsung Nepal is striding to launch the device very soon in Nepal. Although Samsung Nepal officials hesitated to give a solid word on the date, they implied that the device will launch in the second week of February.  [Update: Samsung Galaxy M10 Price in Nepal: Rs. 13,790 & Galaxy M20 Price in Nepal: Rs. 18,490]  Talking about the pricing, unlike the other smartphone brands, Samsung has always managed to keep the pricing of the device close to the international market. Even this time, it will be no different. Samsung has promised to keep the price in Nepal as close as the price in India.

Either way, they used to provide a good value for money on the packs that were getting cheaper and cheaper over time. However, the company’s new Gajjabko Data Pack that replaces the existing Daami Data pack with a\xa0newer tagline has a larger price tag for a lesser amount of data. It’s also nowhere close to the offerings from NTC and Smartcell, so the choice to buy the new pack is yours.  First, take a look at Ncell’s new Gajjabko Data pack:   Now take a look at the package it’s actually replacing:         Did you spot the difference? The Daami data pack was giving out 220MB of data for just Rs 24.26 which is Rs 0.11/MB. Compare that to the new Gajjabko data pack, you only get 75MB for Rs 19.15, and that equals to about Rs 0.25/MB. Both have a validity of one day, with Rs 1/MB after the volume is consumed and a standard PayG rate of Rs 3/MB. You will now have to pay more than twice per one MB than you used to before.  So, if you still want to subscribe to one of the above data packs, you can dial *17123#. Subscribing to one of those is pretty, let’s give them that, but is it really what you want? Just take a look at what SmartCell and NTC are offering.  SmartCell’s\xa0Smart Data Pack   Compared to Ncell’s existing data packs, this feels like a steal. Though its availability is not as good as NTC’s and Ncell’s, it’s a lot cheap.  If you happen to live out of Smart Cell’s existing sustaining regions, take a look at NTC’s data packs.  NTC All Time Data Pack   So, NTC and Smartcell are actually giving out more data at lesser prices. You can check out NTC’s 4G data packs as well, which are even  cheaper than it’s all time data pack .  Coming back to Ncell, we don’t know if this is a temporary change or a permanent one. But it still doesn’t change the fact that Ncell just got more expensive which is definitely not good for customers.

['Rumor: Samsung Galaxy A90 to feature a pop-up selfie camera'],['Samsung'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 4, 2019']",2019-02-04 06:45:50+00:00,"[""Samsung had to face a lot of criticism for opting for a notch on a couple of its recent smartphones. Yes, it’s a water drop one, but a notch is a notch, right? The newly launched  Galaxy M10  and  Galaxy M20  have embraced the notch trend, becoming the very first smartphones from Samsung to do so. While the  M-series  looks to continue that feature for a while, it looks like Samsung has a new set of plans for the A-series launching this year, more specifically for the A90.  In the previous years, Samsung’s devices of A-series had a name with a single digit number. That is set to change this year as the Korean giant is revamping the series to tackle its numerous competitors.  We recently reported a rumor that suggests the  Galaxy A10 , A90’s little brother, to feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset. And we expect the chipset to power the Galaxy A90 as well. However, the major talking point right now is certainly the new rumor that suggests the Samsung Galaxy A90 to come with a pop-up selfie camera. Yes, not a punch hole like on the  Galaxy A8s  or water drop notch, but a pop-up camera like the  Vivo Nex . This step will let Samsung add a bezel-less display up-front on the device.         Why do I say that the A90 is perfect? The answer is that the Galaxy A90 will be Samsung's first pop-up front camera phone, so its screen is perfect, there is no Notch, no Hole.  pic.twitter.com/j01WWtPzh8  — Ice universe (@UniverseIce)  February 2, 2019   With the new design, it might be difficult to make the Galaxy A90 water resistant. But the phone’s predecessor, the  Galaxy A9 2018 , skipped on the feature all together last year. So, it might not be that big of a problem.  Other than that, rumors suggest the Samsung Galaxy A90 to be powered by 6 and 8 GB of RAM that could be coupled with 128 GB of internal memory with a microSD card support. It will be available in three or four different color variants.  The Samsung Galaxy A9 2018 had made headlines last year due to the camera setup it sported on its back. The phone had four cameras, all meant for a different purpose. It was launched in October, last year. So, it will definitely take some time before we see the Galaxy A90 hit the market.""]",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/samsung-galaxy-a90-rumors.jpg']

First, it was its whopping 48 MP camera with  pixel binning . Then, we came to find out that the camera on it  was not as good as the hype . And now, there are a few videos up on  YouTube  showing the  Redmi Note 7 BendGate . Pointing out all the highs and lows of the phone, it is sure to create all the buzz it’s getting.  And then, there’s this another video in which the  Redmi Note 7  survives the bend test! A video by  Gupta Information Systems , which is another popular channel in India, does similar videos to  JerryRigEverything , which you may have heard of. And so, in that video, he takes the phone through a scratch test, splash test, and bend test, and the phone survives through all three.         The video is a bit long as it goes through all the tests. You can also skip to the bend test and watch it there. And you can see that, when pressure is applied, the phone has a bit of flex to it, but does not break, as shown by  Technical Guruji . That does raise some questions, doesn’t it?  I, myself, was quite confused about how this could be possible. For a phone to bend in one video and not in another. But if you notice the way these guys bend the smartphone, you might have the answer.   Technical Guruji, while bending the phone, does not apply uniform pressure on the center, but on two different points with his thumbs. However, in the other video, we can see that the guy applies uniform pressure at the center with his thumbs. That could very well, lead to all that difference in bending.  Now, we’re not going to speculate on whether who was paid or who was not by phone companies, or such. It can be very well, a slight difference in the techniques. Plus, I feel like one is slightly muscular than the other. That, too, could make some difference. Or, maybe, one unit was slightly faulty. But having gone through all the scratch and drop tests, Gupta Information Technology’s video looks a lot more convincing.  All I’m saying is there can be a lot of factors that come into play during such tests. And no matter what, Redmi Note 7 is a good mid-range phone after all. So, you decide whether you’d like to get this or not. And do let us know as well.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Redmi-Note-7-1.jpg']

Fast forward a year, the company has finally shared the specs and details of the devices that look quite promising. Just like a couple of its competitors, the company has developed the devices for two purposes, as one of the cameras takes videos seriously while the other one could arguably be the king of resolution and photography. In terms of design though, both models look similar.  Also Read:  Canon Camera Price in Nepal  Panasonic LUMIX S1 and S1R Specifications  The major talking point about the LUMIX S1R is definitely the sensor it houses. This device comes with a 47.3-megapixel camera that is the highest resolution on any full-frame mirrorless camera meant for consumers. It will be interesting to see how this sensor performs in real life. The S1, on the other hand, is a more video-focused camera that has a 24.2-megapixel camera with better dynamic range and night-time performance.         According to Panasonic, the S1R has a low-pass filter so that the 47.3-megapixel sensor can achieve the highest of the details. For stabilization purpose, the both the S1 and S1R have a 5-axis image stabilization built-in that works with the stabilization on the lenses for better and stable content. A number of devices these days move the sensors around for taking a high-res image, and the new cameras from Panasonic do the same. The sensors from the S1R and S1, with a stabilizer, of course, take a 187MP and a 96MP image respectively.  Also Read:  Nikon Camera Price in Nepal  Panasonic has also included AI for detecting the subjects and to lock focus on the subject. In terms of autofocus, the devices have Panasonic’s contrast-based DFD autofocus system. On the video front, the models are equipped with a capability of shooting videos up to 4K in 60 frames-per-second. There is also the slow-motion feature that captures 1080p videos at 180 frames-per-second.   The company has included an OLED live viewfinder on the device that supports touch sensitivity.

['Acer Swift 5 Review – The Featherweight Champion!'],"['Acer', 'Reviews', 'Swift Series']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['February 2, 2019']",2019-02-02 05:10:17+00:00,"['If you, like, are a power hungry user, then, you probably don’t get all the hype with ultrabooks. But when you get your hands on something as light as the  Acer Swift 5 , you might easily change your mind. This compact laptop is very lightweight – to say the least. It is actually lighter than your notebook – the one that you write on. You can barely feel it in your backpack when you carry it. And if your dog was a good sport, you could probably play fetch with this thing!  Of course, all ultrabooks are not as light as this one. The Acer Swift 5 2018 is as light as they come. And it you’ll be forgiven for thinking this thing might be missing something on the inside when you hold it. And in a plethora of ultra-portable laptops, this one is even more portable. But what else does it pack beside its feather weight?         Acer Swift 5 Specifications:   Design and Build: \xa0Magnesium Alloy body, 13″ form factor, 970 grams  Display: \xa014″ Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Multi-Touch display, 91% SRGB & 60% Adobe RGB, 260 nits peak brightness with Anti-Glare  Keyboard:\xa0 1-level Soft white back-lighting  Processor: \xa08 th \xa0gen i5-8250U processor, Boost Clock up to 3.4 GHz  RAM: \xa08 GB (not upgradeable)  Graphics: \xa0Intel UHD 620, 4 GB VRAM  Battery: \xa036 Watt-hour (up to 6 hours of backup)  Storage: \xa0256 GB SSD  Connectivity: \xa0IEEE 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0  Ports:  2 x\xa0USB-A, Audio port, USB-C 3.1 (no thunderbolt), HDMI,  Price: \xa0Rs.115,000 ($900 international)    Buy Acer Swift 5 here  Design and Build  The design on this laptop, though, is like any other ultra-book out there. It is very slim at  15 mm , sleek and has good looks. The soft rounded edges on a full matte texture make it look like your regular business notebook. The Royal Blue color looks good too, but the golden hinge looks a bit odd, though. The texture makes it prone to finger-prints and smudges, and they can be very difficult to clean. So, it is safe to say that this does look like any other ultra-book.   You’ll feel the real difference is when you lift it. At  970 grams , this laptop is only slightly heavier than the the 12-inch MacBook. And I’ve never carried any other laptop as carelessly as this one just because its super easy to carry. The lightweight is achieved by a  Magnesium Alloy construction . With magnesium lithium on the lid and bottom and magnesium aluminum on the inner chassis, the build should be durable. But, there is also a bit of flimsiness, which is not clearly visible but can be felt.  There is a bit of flex on the keyboard area and the lid, but the amount is acceptable. Also, the display flexes easily, but does not really bend to the point of worrying, though. Also, the hinge appears a bit lose when the lid is open, as it can be seen while shaking the laptop. But by the overall looks and feel of it, it can probably handle small drops and impacts. Of course, I wouldn’t go so far as to test it. This laptop cannot be opened with one hand, the hinge seems very rigid at that point. But it does bend all the way up to 190 degrees, and being super compact, it can come in handy while lazying on the couch or so.  Ports  What ultra-books make up for in compactness, they lose in the choice of ports. The Acer Swift 5, too, packs enough ports  except for an SDCard slot  and  an Ethernet port . With it’s thickness, it could have fit in an Ethernet port and it also has enough space for a card slot. But this laptop does not have either. Other than that, you get  two USB As , one of which  supports USB charging . There’s also a  USB-C , an  HDMI  and the charging port beside it. On the left, there’s an  audio jack , and two  LED lights \xa0that denote whether the laptop is charging or in use.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The keyboard, overall, is good enough. The  chiclet keyboard  gives good feedback while typing and good tactility. It’s keyboard travel is not so deep, but the amount is okay for an ultra-book. Also, with enough spacing between keys, it is comfortable enough to type on for long sessions. It has  Level-1 Soft White back-lighting , which is also easy on the eyes. So, it is pretty nice to work with in dark environments as well.  The only problem with the keyboard is the layout of the arrow keys, and the power button. The power button is on the top right corner, and it is easy to mistake it for the delete key. Similarly, the  arrow keys are half sized and jumbled up  with the Home and End keys. And it is easy to constantly make the mistake of pressing the End key while navigating, which can be pretty annoying whilst working on document or coding, or stuff like that. Another problem is that the Space bar is unresponsive at times when pressed on the side. However, that might not be as big of an issue. A fingerprint scanner on the right, with Windows Hello feature, under the keyboard is also a nice addition.  The trackpad is your regular one. It is a bit small on the width, but seems longer on the length. It has  Windows Precision Driver s on it. While most gestures work very well, scrolling is sometimes a hassle, as it won’t register your two-finger scrolling at times. Tracking is also not that smooth, but the clicks register nicely, though.  Display  In terms of display, it has a standard  14-inch Full HD IPS display  with  glossy finish  and  Touch screen support . The bezels are also thin enough and compliments the screen just right. There’s a web-cam on top, which is again, pretty bad, by the way.\xa0  The glossy panel means that you will get a bit of reflection on the screen. And the touch sensitivity is also only okay at best. That’s because, sometimes, it won’t register your touch gestures or navigation.  But other aspects of the display are quite good. Colors are sharp, and look vivid on the screen. Viewing angles are also great, with no noticeable color shifts, even at sharp angles. It gives you about  96% of sRBG  and some  60% of Adobe RGB . Which means, that it is not a bad choice for editing, but not an ideal machine, however.\xa0  Another disappointing thing about the display would be the low brightness. It can only reach up to a  peak brightness of 260 nits , and that’s too low. Dark scenes in movies might be a bit difficult to grasp as well. And while it may not be that much of a problem, working outside or with a lot of artificial lighting around can be troublesome. A low brightness with a reflective surface – you get the point.  Performance  As for the performance, as far as Ultrabooks go, this one performs good. It packs the  1.6 GHz 8 th- gen Intel i5-8250U processor , combined with  8 GB RAM , and that makes it fast enough. The U-series processor are known for power efficiency and compromise on the performance slightly, but this is to be expected from an Ultrabook. Nonetheless, it will handle most tasks you throw at it.  You can do most things you can do on a normal computer. Browsing the Internet with over 20 tabs open? Check. Adobe Photo-shop, or Light-room? Check. Have like 5 or 6 things running in the background while working? Double Check. Video Editing? Check. It only lags a bit if you’re editing large sized files, but that is to be expected from a power-efficient processor.  This ultra-book does not have any kind of dedicated graphics, though. It has the  Intel UHD 620 graphics  with  4 GB video memory . And that means you will not be able to play many games on it. Of course, it can handle light gaming, like Dota 2 or CS:GO on medium settings. I tried running GTA V on it, but it doesn’t even meet the specifications for that. So, needless to say, you cannot game on this thing. And it is not actually meant to be one either.  Storage  As for the storage, this one has a  256 GB NVMe SSD . If the storage is not enough, you have to opt for the  i7 version with 512 GB storage , which of course, is more expensive. The SSD speeds are not very good though. On our test, it only obtained a  read speed of 520 MBPS  and a  write speed of 445 MBPS .  Battery Life  The battery life on this laptop is again, only okay. You get a  36 Watt-hour battery , which Acer claims will last you up to 8 hours. But you can only get up to 6 hours of battery life with normal office work usage that includes light browsing and such.  Thermals  Now, this is an ultrabook. And I expected it to heat up during heavy work, just because the ventilation on this thing is scanty. A single vent at under the lid, and three small outlets at the back would not make for a very good air-flow. But to my surprise, it did not heat up that much.  When I was playing those light games or editing a video for some time, the fan would make some noise, but it was still cool enough to work with it on my lap. And I didn’t notice a lot of throttling on performance either. So, all good on that department.  Verdict  So, what can we make of the Acer Swift 5? Honestly, I was not a fan of ultrabooks until I used this one. I also used the  ASUS Zenbook UX430U , but that did not appeal to me as much as this one. And I liked this one, mostly, for a single reason – its feather weight. But it is a also pretty capable work laptop and is one of the best option for those who are always running around. If you have a desktop at home, and want a small, compact, lightweight machine for normal workloads for on-the-go, this is something you can highly consider.  The things I didn’t like about this laptop are the keyboard issues, which is but a minor inconvenience. The brightness is a bit too low, and the location of the speakers make them sound not as good as the Stereo speakers should. The lack of dedicated graphics can be a bummer too, but seeing as how this is not a gaming laptop, that is not a deal breaker. Other than that, I have no complaints.  Ultrabooks mostly cost over a $1000, but this one, you can get for  some $900  at present internationally. In Nepal, however, it will cost  Rs.115,000 , and for that…I think the price is easily justified. I mean, of course, this is not your usual heavy worker or a gaming machine. But what it is, is an ultra-light notebook that doesn’t fall short on performance. You can carry it around all day long, and not feel it either. We’ll probably get a 2019 version of this notebook in the coming months, but right now, this is still a great buy.  Pros:   Super light weight  Good performance  Good aesthetics  Adequate battery life   Cons:   No dedicated graphics  Some keyboard issues  Low brightness']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Acer-Shift-5-Review.jpg']
['What is 5G? Why is it important?'],"['5G', 'Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['February 1, 2019']",2019-02-01 18:09:30+00:00,"['5G is already heating up the market right now. For those of you who have been leaving under a rock, 5G is the successor to 4G – the fourth generation of wireless connection. Although, the 4G networks is still not prevalent in most of the area in Nepal, engineers and scientists have already developed 5G, and it will come into being from 2019.  The most impressive feature about 4G was definitely the speed improvement it had over 3G, and like its predecessor, 5G hopes to do the same. Researchers claim that the technology will be able to replace the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) connection, which is certainly a tough thing to do. However, that certainly makes 5G all the more interesting.  5G network is not just about being fast, but also about supporting tens of thousands of users simultaneously without any compromise. For e.g. tet us consider a scenario where over 50,000 people in a stadium are trying to use mobile data on their smartphones. The current 4G antennas (masts) cannot handle that number of simultaneous users and you cannot even upload a selfie on instagram at that instance. A deal breaker, right?        However, 5G could be the perfect solution for such cases. 5G’s innovative technology can allocate each users with their own antennas. A small Base Station (BTS) can have up to 256 antennas closely packed together. This is possible by using smaller millimeter wavelength (mmW) athat are operating at higher frequency, 10 times higher than current 4G frequencies resulting in vehement speed.   5G’s advanced antennas tech forms data beams that will track and focus on the devices at work only when needed. This results in enhanced spectral efficiency (data volume per area unit), less battery consumption, better coverage, and higher bit rates in larger portions of the coverage area.  All the contemporary mobile networks range between 800 MHz and 3500 MHz, but 5G uses spectrum above 6 GHz. The use of such high frequency not only improves data speed, but also offers ‘virtually zero’ latency (time taken by a packet of data to get from one designated point to another). Latency or Delay plays a big role in real-time response. This will help the online gamers who don’t want any delays in their gaming sessions.  Moreover, the new mobile communication system won’t just be used for human communication alone. Instead, we will see different types of devices talking to each other on their own [sometimes referred to as the ‘Internet of Things (IOTs)]. With 5G, the IOTs will have reliable communication links and will also lower transmission delays (latencies).  We are nearing the launch of the first commercial 5G enabled smartphones. This is quite exciting as we have been promised a lot of things with the arrival of the technology. However, it has already started to receive criticism online, and that because of its price. To come up with a new technology requires a lot of time and money.  A lot of companies have spent millions of dollars for 5G, and that will be reflected on the price the technology will carry. That will also be applied to the prices of the smartphones. Pete Lau, the CEO of OnePlus, has already stated that the 5G-enbled OnePlus smartphone will cost $200-$300 more than the ‘normal’ one. Likewise, lots of rumors have surfaced online regarding the high-pricing of Samsung’s 5G-supported device.  5G isn’t cheap, and it will take a lot of time before it becomes a household name. However, the technology is showing a lot of potential, and might be the next big thing in the world of internet.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5G-technology.jpg']

And although this is supposed to be the biggest tech expo in Nepal, it feels more like a\xa0 Haat Bazaar\xa0 of sorts. Why? Because it is now more of a platform for businesses to advertise themselves and sell their products rather than ideas or new concepts. And I, personally, feel like the quality of this mega tech event is going downhill –  year after year .  This 25th edition of the mega event was no different. Named  Subisu CAN Info-Tech 2019 in association with eSewa , the promotion of the event looked promising. There were various schemes to attract visitors too. Besides the attractive discounts on the products there, consumers could win various gift vouchers and prizes every three hours, and 1 lucky winner could get a bumper gift hamper every day.  But it’s really difficult to find anything that will compel you to stay for more than 2 hours – at best. It’s a new edition of the event, but same old exhibitors and same old shortcomings. Actually, some old exhibitors have stopped exhibiting themselves at CAN now. Because, well, anyone can plainly see the event is not what it is supposed to be.        The Good  Fine. Let’s also talk about what is good at CAN Info-Tech 2019. There actually is not much to talk about, though. There is no wow-factor…nothing particularly interesting and not worth much of your time either. So, when I say “good aspects”, I mean it is good compared to other exhibits that are there.  The thing that first cost my attention a few desktop computer exhibits were showcasing computers with the latest  RTX series  graphics and up to  i9-9900K processors .  Ocean Computers , the authorized distributor of MSI in Nepal was one of them and  Nagmani  (ASUS computers) was another. But the price of the computer was hefty,  starting at Rs. 380,000!  But that is to be expected for top-end gaming rigs. However, we found that they were selling their products there with huge profit margins.  Antec , who specializes in power supplies, PC coolers, and cases, also displayed attractive products, and if you want to build your own custom PC, they are a good choice as well.      Good of Can Info Tech 2019   1  of 6               RTX series graphics ASUS         RTX series graphics MSI         9th gen CPUs         Antec         Affordable 3D printer         AI Security Camera                              Another exhibit showcased  3D Printers  that were manufactured in Nepal itself. Which means 3D printers for an affordable price in the country itself. They were also showing a live demo of the printing mechanism, which looked interesting. The price of the 3D printers was  as low as Rs. 35,000 ! They were a bit slow, but the price seemed right.  It was really difficult to find good exhibits at CAN Info-tech. However, it does look like Security Systems are at quite a demand in Nepal right now. Judging by the number of security system companies that were there.  Adhua Technologies  exhibiting AI security cameras that could predict the gender, age and facial expression of the people in the view. That is a bit interesting, but not really new, though.  What else?  Karkhana  made its presence known by giving demos and “smart classes” to enthusiastic children and youngsters about various kind of technology. That is a good way to get children to innovate, and something worth mentioning. As usual, there were some engineering students showcasing their projects like mini robots and such. That is there, every year, but it, at least, catches your attention.  Doko Recyclers  were making people aware about e-waste and recycling them, which is a good initiative, too.  The Bad  Where do I start? I wouldn’t say anything is bad, because nothing is really good at all, besides the things mentioned above. There were no phone companies this time around, no new products were launched. They know that it is really no use paying a hefty sum to present themselves at an expo whose standard is decreasing. There was, however, one brand, Vitu, which makes super cheap phones with modest specs.  Even ISPs like  Vianet  and  WorldLink  were a no show. The only ISP present was  Subisu , which is the title sponsor of the event. And we mostly hear nothing but complaints from Subisu users anyway.  eSewa  was marketing itself pretty aggressively I’d say. Visitors could register themselves for a lucky draw which would lead to an eSewa account being created. But eSewa personnel were going around collecting numbers of people for that very reason. Now, I have an eSewa account, apparently. Marketing themselves is fine and all, but that looks very aggressive.      Bad of Can Info Tech 2019   1  of 4               Accessories         Utlilities         Cheap phones         Subisu                        The Info-tech is really a Haat Bazaar. Companies were selling things like shaving razors to massagers. Pilot pens are something that has always been there. Also, leather goods are something that we can do without at a tech expo. In addition, we even saw coffee and tea powders being exhibited. Now, I love coffee as much as any other person, but CAN Info-Tech is supposed to be the largest technology expo in Nepal, and these things just don’t fit in there!  Companies were luring visitors with discounts and schemes of various kinds. But seeing as how some of them were already placing hefty profit margins, I doubt the discounts are even genuine at all. I would like to give those companies the benefit of the doubt, but for some reason, I can’t. All this doesn’t sum the bad aspects of the expo, but there’s no point in going on about something that’s all bad.  The Ugly  Even after a tech expo that is mostly bad, you know what the ugly part is? That we, as consumers and people have gotten used to the decreasing standards. The expo still gathers a lot of crowds. People swarm in by the thousands, and most leave disappointed. Only some, who actually come to buy stuff might be content.  Sammy Traders , a former exhibitor at CAN expressed that CAN doesn’t really encourage exhibitors to launch new products but exhibit the ones that generate more profit. And so, they have stopped exhibiting themselves at CAN InfoTech.  The essence of CAN Info-Tech is now nothing but a platform to buy flash drives, earphones, and mobile accessories for cheap. And nobody complains. Maybe, partially, because there is no responsible body to take action. CAN (Computer Association of Nepal) is the one organizing it, and the way they started out is commendable. To introduce something like this in a country where IT field is very backward is great. But they haven’t been able to maintain the standard.  What could be the solution to this? Do we need a new body to organize such things in a more effective way? Or is it, us, as general consumers who need to demand more from such tech expos? Do let us know what you think of this year’s CAN Info-Tech.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/can-into-tech-2019.jpg']

['Vivo V15 Pro to Launch on Feb 20 with 32-megapixel Pop-up Selfie Camera'],['Vivo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 31, 2019']",2019-01-31 06:26:47+00:00,"['Vivo’s V11  and the  Vivo V11 Pro  were somewhat of a hit in the smartphone market. The V11 Pro was the cheapest phone around with an in-display fingerprint scanner. And the V11 was a toned down version of the V11 Pro. I, personally, liked the V11 Pro better, but both were good phones nonetheless. The cameras were also pretty great, and the phones, overall, were good value for money.  So, Vivo is shaping up the successors to the V11 and the V11 Pro. And by the naming convention, the names of the successors should be V13 and V13 Pro. But no, that is not it. Call it superstition or whatever, but the number 13 is considered unlucky in many countries, cultures, and all around. So, the Chinese company is going to skip the number 13, and jumping to 15. Just like what OnePlus did by skipping the OnePus 4 / 4T. Hence, the new phones will be called the  Vivo V15  and the  Vivo\xa0V15 Pro  and the pro version is expected to launch in India on 20th of Feb next month. In Nepal, the V15 Pro is expected to launch on the first week of March and V15 on the third week of March.         Diving into more rumors, there is exciting news. Vivo seems to be taking the Full-View display seriously, and there are rumors that both the V15 and the V15 Pro will  not have any kind of notch  up front. Instead, there will be a  Pop-up Selfie camera , just like the  Vivo Nex ! That flagship feature coming to the mid-rangers is a pretty big deal in itself.  So, both phones will have a Full-view display with the same size as the V11 and V11 Pro, i.e.  6.3″ on the V15  and  6.41″ on the V15 Pro . But without any notch, the full-screen experience will increase even with the same screen size. Inside, the V15 might be powered by the  Snapdragon 660 , whereas the V15 Pro will have the  Snapdragon 675 processor . There is no news about RAM configurations, but of course, there will be multiple configurations available from 6 GB to 8 GB. Storage wise, they will have 128 GB of internal storage.   Another major difference between the V15 and V15 Pro is that the  Pro will have an in-display fingerprint sensor , while the V15 will have a rear mounted one. It seems like the in-display fingerprint feature is reserved for the pro variants. And knowing Vivo, both these phones will have great cameras and battery, but there are no numbers for now.  Talking about the camera, the V15 will feature a dual camera on the back, whereas the Pro version will feature a triple rear camera that includes a wide angle lens. Since, Vivo is known for its selfie camera, the company is expected to provide a high res camera of 32MP.  If anything else surfaces, we will surely let you know. And what do you expect and what else do you hope to see on the Vivo V15 and V15 Pro? Do let us know.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/vivo-v15-pro-launch-date.jpeg']

But the good things do not end there. Owing to the durability test done by the Redmi’s CEO Lu Weibing, we also came to know that the screen of the device is sturdy enough to evade the vulnerabilities of cracks and scratches in numerous occasions.

I mean, there has been quite a lot of rumors and then some, about the  Galaxy S10-series . Why is the world obsessing so much over them? Well, for starters…these days, smartphones rarely bring something new. And even if they do, they’re hardly usable like the ones we see on  Vivo Apex 2019 . And Samsung pretty much did a great job with their  Galaxy Note 9 . So, with them announcing they’ll come up with 4 variants of the Galaxy S10, there are a lot of expectations.  Which is why we hear Samsung Galaxy S10 this..Galaxy S10 that… Anyway, the latest rumor to surround the Galaxy S10 series is that they will have  Reverse Wireless Charging . Just like what we saw on the  Huawei Mate 20 Pro . So, this may not be anything new. After all, Samsung has been accused time and again of stealing features from iPhones over the years. While that is an arguable case, this time, it looks like they moved to another one – Huawei, which overtook Apple as the second largest phone company recently.  Now, we can either say they copied the design or got inspired by it, but the end result is the same. Nevertheless, it seems the Galaxy S10 series will pack this reverse wireless charging. But apparently, Samsung is calling it  Powershare . And it works just like it does on the Mate 20 Pro. You place your phone on the back, and if your device supports  Qi Wireless charging , it will draw power from the other phone. But the usability is pretty limited. Wireless charging is still slow, and even more so, with a phone as the power source.         However, this can improve later. Let’s see if Samsung does some improvements with it on their phones. This rumor started with a picture on Samsung Member Community of a controller that demos various features of the S10 when various buttons are pressed. And one particular button depicts reverse charging. And all the hype started.  But according to the rumors, all variants of the S10 series will support this feature. Even the “Lite” version of the S10, that has only  3100 mAh battery . The standard S10 with a  3500 mAh battery , and the S10 Plus, with  4100 mAh battery , all will have this feature. And also the  S10 5G with a massive 5000 mAh  battery.  Let’s see how this feature materializes on these much hyped upcoming flagships.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-rumored-design.jpg']

Well, not for some Chinese smartphone companies anyway. After the success of  Oppo F9 , the Chinese company is set to launch  Oppo F11  and  Oppo F11 Pro  soon.

So, about these devices…the Oppo F11 and Oppo F11 Pro carrying the model numbers CPH1909 and CPH1969 were certified by NTBC in Thailand. Which means, we will be seeing these phones very soon. And these phones will launch in India first.  There is not much information available about these phones at present, though. The only thing we know for sure is that the Oppo F11 and the Oppo F11 Pro will have a  triple camera setup  and will feature  10X Optical zoom  technology. And that is a new technology in smartphone cameras, which is interesting as well. The highest Optical zoom at present is at 3X, which is in the  Huawei Mate 20 Pro .        But Oppo is reportedly, going to showcase its 10X Optical Zoom in the MWC (Mobile World Congress) 2019, so, it should be packing a good one. And that’s all we have on the F11 and F11 Pro.

The phone packs dual rear cameras, tall display, and a huge battery on the inside. But what more features are there on the phone. Let’s check that out.  Vivo Y91i Overview  The phone is targeted at the multimedia enthusiasts and the tall 6.2-inch display readily cues it. The display on the device is also capped with 2.5D curved glass on the top. The screen on the device is a Halo display, which is Vivo’s fancy name for the display with teardrop/water drop notch. Since the notch is small, it may not be all that obtrusive. However, the screen on the Vivo Y91i is only HD+. So, you might notice some pixelation on the display while viewing contents on the phone.         On the performance front, the handset is powered by Helio P22 chipset packing 2GB of RAM alongside. Storage wise, the phone is showered with 32GB of onboard memory, which can be expanded up to 256GB via SD card. Talking about the software, the phone boots on Android Oreo out of the box with Vivo’s custom UI on the top.  Camera is one of the biggest highlights on the device. The phone boasts a dual camera setup at the back incorporating 13MP primary sensor and a 2MP depth sensor. With camera pair at the back, the Vivo Y91i is also capable of capturing portrait images. On the front, an 8MP selfie shooter resides meticulously on its tiny notch.   Big battery is the USP of the phone. The phone packs a humongous 4030mAh battery. And with the power-efficient chipset and a low-res display on the board, the battery is capable of providing around two days of battery life on the normal use. However, Vivo Y91i comes with a micro USB port, which looks antiquated these days. Also, there is no fast charging support mentioned. So it may take a substantial amount of time to get the battery fully charged.   The phone comes in Starry Purple and Ocean Blue color variants. And both of these handsets are available for purchase at Rs. 20,990 on the retail stores.

['Samsung Galaxy M10 Review: Samsung’s first budget phone done right?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['January 28, 2019']",2019-01-28 12:53:46+00:00,"['So, Samsung replacing their Galaxy J-series with the new M-series is evident by now. And they have launched two new phones in the M-series with so many updated features and stuff. While the J-series were good phones, other phones from Chinese brands were just a lot better. It was high time that they did something about it, and with the M-series, they’re really trying.  What we have today, here is the Samsung Galaxy M10, which was launched alongside its bigger sibling, the\xa0 Galaxy M20 .\xa0But the M10 is Samsung’s attempt at a budget category. And this has been the weak spot of Samsung. Will Samsung be able to change that with the M10? Let’s find out in this Samsung Galaxy M10 Review.         Samsung Galaxy M10 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.2-inch IPS LCD display with 2.5D curved glass on the top  Resolution:\xa0 HD+ (720 x 1520 pixels) @ 269PPI  Chipset: \xa0Samsung’s Exynos 7870  CPU:  Octa-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53  GPU:\xa0 Mali-T830 MP1  RAM:\xa0 2/3GB  Storage:\xa0 16/32GB; Expandable via micro SD card (Dedicated slot)  OS:\xa0 Android 8.1 (Oreo) with Experience UI 9.5 on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual camera – 13MP wide-angle + 5MP ultra-wide-angle camera, LED flash  Front Camera:  5MP  Sensors:\xa0 accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery:  3400mAh non-removable battery   Design and Build  First off, the design of the Samsung Galaxy M10 looks not-so-new. It looks, cheap and feels the same in your hands, especially with the speaker grill at the back, which used to be a feature in very old Samsung phones. But compared to what we used to get in the past, this is an improvement. The plastic back has a glossy finish and is not a fingerprint magnet as we usually see on glass or other glossy back phones from OPPO and Vivo.  The build quality seems decent – sturdy enough, and exactly what you’d expect from a phone at this price range. It is plastic, so, durability might be a concern, but when it comes to taking abuse, we know plastic backs do a much better job than metal or glass even if they don’t look as good or premium.   This phone, however, feels a bit hollow inside like the weight distribution is off somewhere. But there are no creaks or bending, or things like that, so its okay.  I am, however, unsure about the front display’s glass protection. I used it without a screen protector and until now, we had minor scratches, but nothing serious.  To talk about other aspects of the design, all buttons are on the right – a volume rocker and the power button. Thankfully, no Bixby button! But being a budget phone, it’s no surprise that there’s no Bixby here. The buttons are also tactile enough.  Display  The display here is a big 6.2” IPS LCD and not the AMOLED one, but it’s pretty good for a budget phone. The resolution is only HD+, so, don’t expect all that sharpness.  In terms of brightness, it is stellar, even outdoors, there is literally no problems. And this is something you cannot say for most Samsung phones even today.   The color reproduction is fine too, crispy and vibrant. I cannot say I disliked any part of the display, really. And look Samsung has also included an auto-brightness sensor!  For the price, this is as good as it gets. One thing I have to complain is that while its outdoor brightness is remarkable, its minimum brightness is still too bright for taste.  If you have this habit of using your phone in the dark before going to bed, then, it will be difficult to do so with this phone.   Also, the smartphone has a notch on the top. Samsung is a company that has been ranting others for having ugly notches on their screens. But this time, they have a notch up top and calling it the Infinity-V display, because, well, it’s a V-shaped notch. It looks like pure hypocrisy from the company, as Samsung used to make a lot of fun of notches in the past. But, to be honest, the notch does not look that ugly and it’s easy to get used to. Looks like Samsung understood that as well.  Performance  On to the performance, the Galaxy M10 packs an Exynos 7870 processor, and not the rumored  Exynos 7872 . But with the SoC, it runs as expected. Of course, the chipset is around 3 years old, it was first seen on the J7 2016, and the fact that it is still being used on an upgraded phone bugs me a bit. Did they make a truckload of the 7870 chips or something? Because it seems they’re still using it from the same batch every now and then.  But the performance leaves very less to complain about though for a budget phone. The unit I reviewed had 2 GB RAM, but for that, the performance is quite good. The user interface is smooth enough. There were no lags of any kind or any stutters either. Apps like  Facebook ,  Instagram ,  and  YouTube  run smoothly. Games like Asphalt 9 runs pretty smooth too, albeit at low settings.  PUBG is playable too, at lowest settings. The frame rate isn’t that good actually, but it is still playable without much hiccups. And it is very unlike Samsung to provide something this good at this price range. So, there is not much to complain, but again they should have gone with a more powerful chipset.  The phone will also be available in a 3 GB / 32 GB variant, and that might be able to perform slightly better.  Software and UI  Moving on to the software, this phone still runs on Android 8.1.0 Oreo, but Samsung has already announced that this phone will get the Android Pie update later in August. So, okay, we need to bear with it for the time being.  And of course, since, it’s Samsung, you get Samsung Experience 9.5 designed for Galaxy M skin on top of it. So, it is more or less similar to a typical Samsung phone, with a few changes. There are obviously, a bunch of bloatware and unwanted apps. But you can always choose to disable them, so, that’s a nice feature to have as well.   And since this is Samsung’s first phone with a notch, the implementation of it is quite good. There is also an option to hide the notch under Display Settings inside FFull-ScreenApps, and you can also set personal preference for each app. And if you find Samsung’s navigation buttons organized in the wrong way, then, that, too, can be changed from the settings menu. From here, you can also switch to gestures instead of display button navigation. Apart from these, there aren’t worth anything mentioning in the UI or software.  Battery  This phone packs a 3400 mAh battery, which is a good size for a phone at this price. With this battery, you can easily expect over 6 hours of on-screen time with ease. Plus, the display is only HD resolution and the 14nm based Exynos 7870 is power efficient, which helps to improve battery life.  With around half-an-hour of PUBG, around 5 hours of YouTube, 30 mins of scrolling through Social Media, and about 20 minutes of smaller games, this phone still had 60% of battery left. So the battery offers a substantial backup! But to be fair, it was all at minimum brightness. But, you get the idea though.   I also started my day with just about 40% of battery, and I was fairly confident that it would last me the whole day. And it did with around 5% left by the end of the day. The standby times were also great. The battery dropped only by 3% when kept idle for 10 hours, and all of this was without any kind of battery saving turned on. Samsung’s effort on battery optimization really shows here. I was not expecting something like this. So, it pleasantly surprised me.  The one thing it lacks is the USB Type C port and Fast Charging, but with the 2A/5V charger, it took around 2 hours to get charged from 0 to 90%, but it’s not that bad at all.  Camera  Now the cameras. What we have seen in even budget phones these days is a dual camera, and the Galaxy M10 is no different.  It has a dual camera of 13 + 5MP, but the secondary 5MP lens here is not a depth sensor, but a wide angle one. That is a strange convention, but it is good to have a wide angle lens as it is a nice touch.      Normal Mode        Normal Mode     Normal Mode         The camera quality from the primary 13MP lens is nothing to go on about. Basically, there are less sharpness and details. Also, the autofocus is slow and there is no autofocus for wide angle lens. What I found strange was the wide angle lens has better colors and dynamic range when compared side by side with the primary 13MP lens.   You might also notice a bit of fish-eye effect in the images from the wide angle lens, but that can be fixed later by a shape correction option. But what it does is just crops out the fish-eye bit parts of the phone, so, I don’t know what to say about that.      Normal Mode     Wide-angle Mode     Normal Mode     Wide-angle Mode   There is also a Live Focus feature for taking portraits, and without a depth sensor, the portraits are as expected. The bokeh isn’t aggressive enough and unlike previous Samsung phones, you don’t get an option to adjust the blur or choose the focus area, before or after taking pictures.      Normal Mode     Portrait Mode     Normal Mode     Portrait Mode   On the notch we talked earlier, there lies a 5 MP front camera, which is pretty good. The details are okay. It actually better than the rear camera. The selfie portrait is done by software and looks decent as well. You can also find the smart beauty option that smooths the skin and removes the blemishes. It’s not that aggressive as you see on OPPO or VIVO phones, which is good.               Portrait Selfie     AR Sticker     AR Sticker   There are also a few stickers which are fun to use for a time. Other than that, there’s nothing worth mentioning about the cameras.  Talking about the video, you have the option to record from the wide angle as well as the primary lens. But, I suggest you chose the wide angle option, mainly coz of 3 reasons: wide angle, better stabilization, and better colors.  Overall, the camera is not a WOW factor and I think they could have made it a little bit better.  For high-resolution samples\xa0 click here .  Extras  To round up other aspects of the phone, the speaker seems a bit tiny. It is loud, but the sound quality is not very enjoyable. And since the speaker grill is on the back, it is easy to muffle while laying it on the table.   As for the security features, it does not have a fingerprint sensor. There is face recognition, which doesn’t work in low-light and is very inconsistent, i.e. it works sometimes, and sometimes not.  Also, it has DRM Widevine L1 security, so if you watch Amazon Prime content or Netflix content, you can watch it in HD or better. I am bringing this up because even in celebrated phones like  Pocophone F1 , we don’t get this feature.  Besides that, there is not much to talk about. After all, it is your regular Samsung phone with some revamps and upgrades.  Verdict  So, to sum up, the Samsung Galaxy M10 is a good upgrade over Samsung’s previous budget phone and it has a considerable number of upgrades, except for the chipset, obviously. But still, this is the company’s best effort so far. They’re really trying to listen to the customers. We had been saying from a long ago that they needed to improve their budget and mid-range sector. And now, they are trying to listen.  Having said that, I still feel it’s not enough, especially in India where the Galaxy M10 is targeted to. For instance, the Redmi Y2, that is known as the  Redmi S2 , here in Nepal packs a Snapdragon 625, making it a better performer than the Exynos 7870. Plus, the Redmi Y2 has better cameras than this one.\xa0 Samsung has improved a lot but, does it do enough to beat the competition in every aspect? Not really.  Yes, it can compete with the present contenders. But beating them will take some more effort. There is no denying that this is a great phone, even among the best in the Nepali market. They’re trying guys. They’re trying really hard.  But, even for all that attempt, it’s still not a perfect “Budget phone”. Am I willing to give Samsung the benefit of the doubt, and choose this phone over others at the same price? Maybe for once considering the best-in-class after sales it has.\xa0But Samsung, keep in mind that there is still a long way to go.

['Samsung Galaxy M20 Review: Coming Back to Life?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['January 28, 2019']",2019-01-28 12:53:16+00:00,"['Samsung has finally done what it claimed it would not do. Yes, you guessed it right, Samsung has implemented notches on the Galaxy M series smartphones! And today I will be talking about one of them, the Samsung Galaxy M20!  Like the  Galaxy M10 , the M20 belongs to the budget segment, among the phones priced below 15000 Indian Currency. By the way, we have also reviewed the Galaxy M10, that was also launched alongside the M20 so make sure you check it out the Samsung Galaxy M10 review as well.  So, moving on, Samsung, this time has tweaked the selling process, making the M series an online brand. Brands like OPPO, Xiaomi, Huawei have been in this game forever and Samsung, as rigid as it was, finally has boarded the same train. Will it be a turning point for Samsung or will it not, we are yet to see. But what we can ascertain right now is how does the M20 fare in real life usage. Let’s find out in this Samsung Galaxy M20 review.         Samsung Galaxy M20 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6.3-inch IPS LCD display with 2.5D curved glass on the top  Resolution:\xa0 Full-HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels)  Chipset: \xa0Samsung’s Exynos 7904  CPU:  Octa-core (2×1.8 GHz Cortex-A73 & 6×1.6 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU:\xa0 Mali-G71MP2  RAM:\xa0 3/4GB  Storage:\xa0 32/64GB; Expandable via micro SD card (Dedicated slot)  OS:\xa0 Android 8.1 (Oreo) with Experience UI 9.5 on the top  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual camera – 13MP wide-angle + 5MP ultra-wide-angle camera, LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 8MP  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 5000mAh with fast charging support (15W fast charging, takes 2 hours and 15 minutes for full charge)   Design:  Let’s get started with the design! The back on the Samsung Galaxy M20 has a shiny plastic material, that feels okay on hands, unlike the M10. The M10 though featuring a similar back material, felt light on hands, but the M20 is heavier and does not feel that cheap. The phone feels heavy, because well, it packs in a huge battery. But the weight on it not evenly distributed, meaning, the lower portion of it feels heavier than the upper portion.  All the buttons are on the right and placed high above and for a people with small hands like me, it surely is difficult to reach the buttons. On the left, we have the SIM tray with 2 nano SIM and a dedicated microSD card. Down below, you see a speaker grill, a secondary microphone, a USB C port, and a headphone jack! We are glad to see the headphone jack here. Upwards, there is only a primary microphone!  To be honest, Design wise, it does not look like a Samsung phone. If the Samsung logo was not there, I would have mistaken it for some Chinese brand. I don’t have a problem with that actually.\xa0 You will have to do, what you do to keep the costs low!  Display  On the front, you get a 6.3 inches display with Full-HD+ resolution. If you have been expecting a Super AMOLED panel, it’s not. It’s s an LCD one. But it is still a good display by the way. There is a notch on top, that Samsung has a fancy name for, an Infinity V display. With a tiny notch like this and thin bezels, Samsung has managed to deliver a good full view display here. Even the chin here is relatively smaller than what we usually see on the smartphones available at a similar price tag.   So, coming back to the display, it’s a sharp one with good colors and viewing angles. Sunlight legibility is average though! You have an option to use the entire screen or hide the notch during usage. But since the notch is very tiny, I didn’t have problems with it. There is an auto brightness feature, which I glad to see on a Samsung’s budget device. In the past, Samsung usually used to cut off the Ambient light sensor, which is not the case here.   And although Samsung has not specified what kind of protection is there on the M20, it’s really impressive that there are no scratches that have appeared on the screen. Although the back garnered some scratches on my use, it’s not that noticeable.  Performance  The insides of the Galaxy M20 is fueled by Samsung’s new midtier Exynos 7904 chipset. By architecture, it is a 14 nm chipset with 8 cores. Two of those are high-performance ARM A-73 cores clocked at 1.8 GHz and other 6 are Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.6 GHz.  It’s not a new chipset by any means and if it was the start of 2018, I would have not complained but at the same price range, you get Snapdragon 636 or the Snapdragon 660, which has a better GPU performance compared to the 7904. In terms of CPU, the performance is more or less the same.  Now, moving on to how this one performs, it’s satisfactory. I would not at all complain because my basic tasks ran well. I had no problems in multitasking whatsoever and app opening is fast too. I did not feel lags on heavy usage as well.  As far as gaming goes, I played all different kinds of games in this one, where PUBG is playable at medium settings with a few stutters here and there, nothing that would affect gameplay! Similarly, Asphalt 9 ran quite well, I must say. And I equally kept checking while playing games for any thermal issues but, on a brighter side faced none! So, the performance side of it is decent at the best!\xa0As for storage, you get two variants, 3GB RAM with 32 GB storage and 4 RAM with 64 GB storage.  Software and UI  On to the Software side, if you have been expecting One UI, it is not here yet, and so is Android Pie. The phone comes with Android Oreo 8.1 out of the box with Samsung Experience version 9.5 running on the top. But we have had some sources revealing that Android Pie and One UI is to come in the M series very soon. Well, if you ask me, I hope for the soonest.   Anyways, I have always liked Samsung UI. It gives you a little more than the basics, a bit of bloatware in technical terms. Offerings from Samsung, Google and Microsoft are pre-installed here, out of which only some can be uninstalled. On to the usability part, we don’t have an app drawer, but the vertical swiping interface helps make the home screen less cluttered. There are gesture features that may come handy. Other than that, we have nothing new in the UI to talk about actually.  Cameras  Okay, so let’s talk about the cameras now. Up until now, we have rarely seen Samsung make cut-outs of the camera department, well except for the  Galaxy A7   and  Galaxy A9 . Here in the M20, we see dual 13+5 MP cameras at the back. The secondary camera is not a depth sensor, but a wide-angle lens. Well, that is something unique on a budget phone. As I checked the cameras, they looked decent to me. But let’s get deeper into specifics. First, let’s go the back camera!   As I tested the cameras, in good lighting, the pictures are good actually with a good amount of details, nothing extraordinary though. They are not over saturated and the balance of colors is actually quite nice to see. It seems natural on objects and sceneries. Other than that, I have quite liked the normal pictures.      Samsung Galaxy M20 Normal Back camera samples   1  of 10                                                                                                                      The camera UI is also very friendly and easy to understand. The icons tell you clearly, which is what function, so I had no difficulty using it.      Samsung Galaxy M20 live focus mode on back camera   1  of 3                                                There is a live focus option AKA the portrait mode, which is also not bad to say at the least. However, what I didn’t like is When you are closer to the subject, the blur is very minimum. And, on top of that, you cannot adjust the blur or the focus area – the feature you can find in older Samsung phones. Edge detection is fine though and the blur looks natural too.      Samsung Galaxy M20 Normal vs Wide angle mode   1  of 6                                                                              Now there is something else to talk about too, the wide-angle mode! I don’t know if a wide-angle lens is actually necessary but I am not complaining of having it here. On a device priced below INR 15,000, I did not expect a good one, but its good enough for the price tag.  But, like with the M10, you get a fisheye effect which can be corrected to some extent using a shape correction feature.  On the other hand, night shots are miserable! There are grains and noises all over and the pictures look muddy. We had much much better cameras on a 2-year-old  Galaxy J7 Pro , if only, Samsung could replicate the cameras of the J7 pro, it would have been so good.      Samsung Galaxy M20 back camera, night time samples   1  of 5                                                                    As for the videos, they can be recorded up to Full-HD at 30fps. The lack of 4K is expected at this price point. Talking about video quality, its good with nice levels of detail and low noise. But since it lacks stabilization, If your hands are shaky, your videos will turn out like jittery!  Okay, let’s get into the selfie side of things. The 8MP Selfie camera is good, and nothing extraordinary just like the back camera. The selfies I took was bright and colorful but again, they are slightly processed and I got smoother skin every time.      Samsug GalaxY M20 normal selfie samples   1  of 7                                                                                        Things are the same in the selfie focus mode too in terms of skin tone.      Samsung Galaxy M20 live focus selfie samples   1  of 3                                                The blurring and edge detection in the selfie ficus mode seem good enough though.  There are AR stickers which are not useful but are fun. There is a beauty mode and something called smart beauty as well, which is basically things that make you have fairer and smoother skin. But having said everything, the selfies are not bad, they are what I expected it to be.  But again, night time selfies are not very good. Take a look at some of the samples and be the judge yourself!      Samsung Galaxy M20 night time selfies   1  of 2                                      For high-resolution samples  click here .  Battery:  Okay, the Galaxy M20 also has something else that needs attention, the battery! There is a huge 5000 mAh battery in here and let me tell you it is very very enduring. On my use, it got me straight 2 days without plugging in a charger.  Even while using it intensively, I got one day’s usage time, which is pretty dope to say at the least. The device can give you a screen on time of over 10 hours. Also, there are various power saving modes that can further add up to battery endurance.   This huge battery is supported by a 15-watt quick charger too. This one takes around one hour to get 50% juice and takes around 2 hours and 15 minutes to get fully charged, which I think is a good amount of time for such a huge battery.  Plus its very difficult to drain it. So, once you charge it, you and your M20 are up for a long time, no denying that! Also, Samsung claims to have some sort of battery optimization software inside that further makes it more durable. This, hands down is very very impressive!  Extras:  Now on to the extras, the speakers at the bottom are average. It is not very loud but the sound quality is good I must say! It’s balanced and does not distort at the highest of volumes. It’s not loud, I would say again, but not bad either!   The fingerprint sensor at the back is fast and accurate. It gets it correct all the time and is also placed at a good and reachable distance. But the facial unlock is a hit or a miss for me. I mean, sometimes it did not read my face at all and I had to switch to fingerprint scanning many times. But there is this slight animation on the notch while scanning your face, which is quite fun to watch although sometimes it does not read your face!   Furthermore, The Galaxy M20 certifies Widevine L1 certification, so I had a good time watching Netflix content in HD or better resolution on the big screen.  And, the M20 has all the necessary sensors, from proximity to gyro to ambient light sensor, but the only tiny thing missing is an LED notification light.  Conclusion  So, the Galaxy M series is definitely a good move by Samsung! The things that I like about the M20 is the battery life, USB type C with fast charging and its bright and color accurate IPS display. However, what Samsung could have done better are the camera performance and the choice of SoC. These are the areas where Samsung, with the resources they have, can definitely do better on their future M-series devices.  So, as of now, can the Galaxy M20 compete against the present devices, like the Zenfone Max Pro M2, the Realme 2 Pro and the Redmi Note 7? Well, like I said earlier, if Samsung had included a better chipset and a better lens, it would have been a steller device but as of now, the other devices I mentioned earlier are more value for money.  So, what do you think about Samsung M20?\xa0 Is it compelling enough? Would you choose this over other Chinese smartphones out there? Let us know in the comments below! And I am Pratima and see.

And after their iPhone XS and what not, they were working on quite a number of stuff. They are also supposedly making an  iSheet  – a sleep improving technology. And now, there are reports they are creating  AirPods 2  – a successor to their wildly popular AirPods. Who knew the  $159 pair earphones  would be so popular?  But now, the market is heating up. Google, Amazon and many other companies are preparing to launch their own line of such earphones. So, there is bound to be a lot of competition in the market. And how can the existing AirPods improve? New features…probably…but what kind of? How about  earphones that monitor your health ? Sounds crazy, doesn’t it? But it’s Apple. They’re used to making crazy things…like the  iPhone XS  which has hardly any improvement over the  iPhone X  yet sells for $1000.  So, this new AirPods 2 will come out in the first half of 2019. How will they monitor your health exactly? That remains to be seen. But for a company, whose  Apple Watch saved a life , this probably won’t be a challenge. We’re all waiting to see how, though. Also, these new AirPods will have upgrades in their Bluetooth capabilities and wireless charging feature as well.        In addition, there is an all-new design AirPod currently on the works, which will be launched in early 2020. Another curious thing, this is.

['Redmi Note 7 Camera: Is all that hype for naught?'],['Xiaomi'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 27, 2019']",2019-01-27 12:15:50+00:00,"['Xiaomi’s  Redmi Note 7 , the Chinese companies latest announcement has already managed to stir the market quite a bit. Especially, because of the camera hardware it’s packing. And more so, because how it manages to take pictures through its 48 MP camera with Snapdragon 660 processor on the board. using  Pixel Binning . And with so many initial impressions going around, there is a lot of hype with the Redmi Note 7.  But is the Redmi Note 7 really all that better? How much of an upgrade is it over the  Redmi Note 5 AI  or the  Redmi Note 6 Pro ? Well, in terms of specs and internals it could be. After all, the Redmi Note 7 has a much more powerful  Snapdragon 660   compared to  Snapdragon 636  on the Redmi Note 5 AI and the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Also, the Redmi Note 7 features a larger screen with more screen-to-body aspect ratio. Other things, however, remain the same with 3 / 4 and 6 GB RAM options, and that 4000 mAh battery. So, it is all down to the camera.         The selfie camera is the same 13 MP camera on both Redmi Note 5 AI and Redmi Note 7. There are dual selfie cameras on the Redmi Note 6, but since the rear camera of the Redmi Note 6 Pro and Redmi Note 5 AI are the same, let’s consider it as one. Let’s go with the Redmi Note 5 AI. And compared to that, the camera on the Note 7 looks like a huge upgrade. But is it really?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcpCPLmkwd8  The Redmi Note 7 packs a  large 48 MP primary sensor  at the back, with the Redmi Note 5 AI keeping a regular 12 MP lens. But since the Snapdragon 660 chipset cannot process images from a 48 MP hardware, it uses  pixel binning  to capture a 12 MP picture from the large sensor. While the resolution is the same, the technology on Redmi Note 7 should help in low-light photos considerably. And it’s not wrong for anyone to think the Redmi Note 7 camera is much better. But turns out…not so much!  A video by  TechTablets.com \xa0comparing the cameras of the Redmi Note 5 AI and Redmi Note 7 shows that the Note 7 has not got many advantages over the Note 5. In fact, it’s the Note 5 AI that’s clearly the winner between the two, i.e. in terms of camera. The Redmi Note 7 wins in three aspects: Low-light (given that it uses pixel binning, no surprises), better details in shadows and better front camera.   Video Credits: TechTablets.com  And even in this, the Note 7 wins very slightly over the Note 5 AI. It provides slightly better details in low-light and has a better focus on the front camera. But on many other aspects, the Note 5 AI wins. It has better color accuracy – producing colors that are closer to the real thing, better auto-focus, better exposure and another advantage with its LED flash for the front camera. The Note 7’s auto-focus has issues and tends to keep “breathing” before it can actually focus on a subject. Also, pictures in the sunlight tend to come out a bit cooler than they really are. And colors have slightly less temperature.  In addition, in terms of video recording…while the image stabilization on both are on par, the Note 7’s audio recording is not as good as on the Redmi Note 5 AI. So, with a score of 5-3, the Redmi Note 5 AI is the clear winner.  Of course, this is someone else’s perception, but the examples are there for all of us to see. We can only know if all that is really true when we get our hands on the product ourselves. And that might take some time. But until then, I would not be hyped about the Redmi Note 7 for now. And so, if you have a Redmi Note 5 AI right now, and it is performing good enough, there is no need to switch for now.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/redmi-note-7-camera-3.jpg']

It is thin…actually pretty thin for a gaming laptop at  24 mm . It is also pretty lightweight, weighing only  1.85 kilograms . This  15” laptop  in a 14-inch body is pretty compact, and you’ll love its portability. It fits easily in most backpacks and is quite comfortable to carry around. This laptop is also easy enough to open with one hand, and it can also open it up to a  straight 180-degree angle . And while you might think it’s not very useful, it is actually handy sometimes.         The build is fully aluminum, but even for that, it does not feel as sturdy. But it might have been done to keep the laptop lightweight. There is a bit of flex all over the chassis and on the lid as well. It does worry me a bit, but not a real deal breaker. The soft rounded edges make for a very sleek looking device overall.   I feel like the design is worth looking at. Subtle gold accents on a  full matte black sandblasted texture  look very new and appealing. This is something very different from MSI’s usual bold red coloring. Even MSI’s signature Dragon Sigil gets a golden touch. There is a golden strip running around the edges of the lid, and that gives it sort of a classy look.   The design is a matter of preference, though. And if you’re a fan of MSI bold colors, then, you might not like it all that well. But I, for one, like it quite a lot. With the color choice, it does not scream “gaming”, but also doubles as a work laptop that you can pull out in a coffee shop to work with.  But of course, this accent might not have worked very well on bigger gaming rigs. But on this particular machine, it is gold! (pun intended)  Ports  When the size of the laptops gets smaller, they tend to compromise on the ports. And this laptop does it too. It  sacrifices the SDcard slot , which seems like an unnecessary decision. The device with its specs would work pretty well for editing, but not having an SD card slot, is a minor inconvenience.   Other than that, you get all your necessary ports. There are  3 USB A s,  a headphone jack  and  audio input ,  an HDMI ,  a DisplayPort ,  a USB-C  with Thunderbolt 3 support with 4 lanes of PCIe.  This means you can use up to three external monitors at once if you fancy.   Keyboard and Trackpad  The Trackpad here is nothing special. It uses  Windows Precision Drivers.\xa0 The\xa0gestures are on point, but the tracking is not always smooth and accurate. Other than that, there are no problems.   The keyboard is MSI’s standard  SteelSeries Engine 3 keyboard  with that individual key RGB backlighting. Being a 15″ laptop, it is not your regular full-sized keyboard, though. Typing on the keyboard is great, the keys give tactile feedback, but is not that noisy. With about 1.4 mm key travel, it is pretty comfortable as well.   There are  16.7 million colors  in the backlighting, which, even though, we don’t know what to do with, is there. The Steel Series 3 software lets you modify the backlighting patterns, which is pretty comprehensive. Being SteelSeries, it features  in-game backlighting , meaning, the keyboard changes light patterns according to the games you’re playing. Another good feature is when you press the Function Key, it highlights the respective keys as well. There’s a lot going on with the keyboard, but overall, it is a great keyboard.   Display  The display is simply a treat. It has a standard  15.6” Full HD IPS display  but the very thin bezels make it much better. Plus, the  144 Hz refresh rate \xa0makes games very fluid. But you’ll also notice the smoothness during regular usage. The screen has a  7 ms of response time , which is a bit slower than the 3 ms on the  MSI GE63 Raider , but that amount of difference is barely noticeable.   The display quality is also pretty good. Viewing angles are okay with very slight color shifts at sharp angles. Brightness peaks out at  about 290 nits , which is a bit low for liking, but its a gaming laptop. The color accuracy is also definitely there, with  100% sRGB  color and a very close Adobe RGB. Again, you get the MSI’s true display which lets you switch color modes depending on what you’re doing, There’s this designer mode  claiming 100% Adobe RGB , but again, that is not possible on a 1080 panel.  In short, there is nothing to complain about.   Performance  This laptop packs almost the same specs of the GE63 Raider. It has the  Hexa-core 8th gen Intel i7-8750H processor , which, no doubt about it is a great processor. Combined with  16 GB RAM , it can handle almost anything. Multi-tasking is a breeze. And since this is a processor we find on most high-end laptops, so there’s no need to go on about it.  The graphics at play is the  Nvidia GTX 1070 Max-Q  with  8 GB video memory . This is slightly less powerful than your regular GTX 1070, but it can handle almost any games you throw at it. I played a lot of games on it, and it kills! The fast screen on top of it makes it all the better. All the games were on ultra settings, and it did not disappoint with the frame rates for any. Even very high graphics intensive games like PUBG and Witcher 3 ran pretty smooth.   Lighter games like DOTA 2 ran at 130 frames per second, while CS:GO gave up to 190 frames per second. Heavier games like GTV V gives you about 80 and it is the same for PUBG as well. Witcher 3 was about 60 frames per second, though.   The Thermals are also super cool, not literally, though. Because the laptop can get quite hot. While the temperature remains okay on the surface, the bottom panel gets very hot. This means gaming on your lap is not advised. But there is no thermal throttling, even after long hours of gaming. Playing GTA V for hours and hours, on Ultra settings, resulted in no lags or stutters of any kind, so, it’s safe to say there’s no throttling.  There is  MSI’s Dragon Center  that lets you monitor and control your system. It lets you monitor your CPU and GPU performance to adjusting fan speeds and other settings for optimum performance.  The only complaint is that while the laptop is named Stealth, it is not very “stealthy”. Meaning, the fans can get quite noisy, and of course, there’s the  Cooler Boost  option, which can sound pretty annoying but will let you game to the max potential.  As for the storage, there’s only  512 GB NVMe M.2 SSD , which can prove inadequate. The speeds of the SSD, though is not very good. The  read speeds averages at about 550 MBPS  while the  write speeds at 360 MBPS .   Battery  Battery life on gaming laptops has never been their strong suit, and this one is no exception. But this laptop has a good  80 Watt-hour battery  but for that, sacrifices have been made. For instance, there is  no HDD slot  in it. So, if you want to expand the storage, there’s no other way than to replace the SSD with a larger one.  Also, the battery life was not as good as claimed.\xa0 While the claims are in the 7-hour range, it provided us actually half of that figure. It will give you about  3.5 hours on regular usage . On power saver, it can go a bit longer, but nowhere close to 7 hours, though.   Verdict  The MSI GS65 Stealth 2018 looks like a pretty solid gaming notebook. There are a lot of pros outweighing the cons. Actually, finding the negative aspects of this laptop means nitpicking on the small things. The build quality is a bit flimsy, the sound quality is not very good, and it is difficult to open up should you want to upgrade. But that’s about it.  This laptop packs a great design, a great display, excellent performance, and about average battery life. The design is of the laptop, is the most appealing part, followed by its performance. For something so lightweight and thin to pack such performance is impressive in itself. Plus, this is a laptop you can take to your office and not worry about showing off too much, and that matters to a lot of people.   The MSI GS65 Stealth Thin can cost anywhere  from $2000 to $3000  based on the configuration. There are quite a few configurations available from GTX 1060 Max-Q graphics and 256 GB storage, to all the way up to GTX 1070 Max-Q with 1 TB storage and 32 GB RAM. Now, I have no idea about the price of our specific unit internationally but it costs  Rs.2,90,000  in Nepal.  But one thing is now, with the  CES 2019  behind us, this laptop is getting refreshed with the  RTX 2080 Max-Q  graphics. And you can easily tell the performance is better on that one. So maybe, getting that would be a better investment or future-proof. But then again, that will take time to make its way in here. And they will be more expensive. So, this one right here is also a good purchase.  The price does sound steep, but against similar competitors like the Razer Blade 15, this one, to me, is a much better deal.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/msi-gs65-stealth-review.jpg']
['Realme Phones Coming to Nepal soon'],['Realme'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 25, 2019']",2019-01-25 08:42:54+00:00,"['In the plethora of smartphones you’ll find these days,  Oppo  is quite the popular name. But even more so, is its sub-brand, Realme – which is much sought after by everyone. Realme visualizes in “providing phones for the young”. Which means, packing all the trendy features in a stylish body, for a competitive price. You know…making it affordable for the youngsters out there.  And so, it looks like very good value for money. And  Realme 1  got quite the amount of recognition for its “power” and “style” in India just after its launch in May 2018. Hence, you can see why it is such a much sought after brand. And it has been entirely an online exclusive brand. You can only buy them via online stores like Amazon.in and Flipkart.  Many of you also have asked us whether Realme phones were coming to Nepal. And there were rumors from quite early on that they would. Now, it is official. Realme brand is coming to Nepal.  Jagadamba Mobiles Pvt.Ltd.  will be the authorized distributors of the phone in Nepal, and they’ll be launching the phones very soon. It is not clear as to if they will launch all of the Realme products or only selected ones as of now.        This is certainly exciting news for all of those who have sought after Realme phones. But well, we have yet to see how the pricing will be done in Nepal. And since the online marketplace in Nepal is not as developed, we doubt it will be online exclusive here. And if they are not online, then, they could be a bit more expensive here, due to  these reasons . Let’s see how it plays out.  If the Realme phones provide the same value for money here, as well, then, it will definitely be a hit. But if the case becomes similar to  Honor phones  in here, then, well, there’s nothing we can say about that. So, let’s hope for the best.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/realme.jpg']
['Vivo Apex 2019 Launched – Innovative…but for what?'],['Vivo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 24, 2019']",2019-01-24 13:01:54+00:00,"['Smartphone companies are jostling to get something new to the smartphone world. And these days, it is the Chinese companies that are taking the lead. Vivo is known for bringing such innovative technology early on. And now, they have unveiled the new Vivo Apex 2019. This is a phone you have to see to believe – because…well, would you believe if I told you it has  no selfie camera ?   Yup…you read that right. In a bid to create the  truly bezel-less ,  notch-less  or whatever-less phone, they have had to cut things off. And sadly, the selfie camera didn’t make the cut. Vivo says that it wanted to focus on other aspects of the Vivo Apex 2019 and that they did. But at what cost? With all that it packs, this looks like a solution waiting for a problem. And that, too, I am skeptical about.         Anyway, let’s focus on what the Vivo Apex 2019 did work on. For starters, this is a phone  without any openings, seams, or buttons . Everything is inside the phone. This phone looks so very simple without any buttons or grills or ports on it. Just a sleek streamlined block of  Waterdrop Glass  with a curved design. Talk about taking the minimalist concept to a whole new level! USB ports are replaced by  MagPort  – a magnetic power connector which enables faster charging and faster data transfer. Speakers are also inside the screen itself. And it uses the  Body SoundCasting technology  for that. This transforms the whole display into a speaker via screen vibration function, so, no need for a speaker grill. This makes the phone entirely water-proof.   As for the screen, the phone introduces a truly bezel-less design, as I already said. It is new but bizarre! The bezels are extinct, and a notch is nowhere to be found. But neither is the selfie camera. The otherwise specs of the screen is unknown, except that it is large, and houses a lot of things, mentioned above.  There is also the presence of an in-display fingerprint sensor. But this time, it is a  Full-Display Scanning technology , with the sensor over almost the entire display. And so, users can touch almost anywhere on the screen to unlock the device. But since last year’s  Vivo Apex   claimed a half-display fingerprint scanning while it only had about 1/3 of the screen, let’s see how this plays out.   As for the rear cameras, it does pack a  dual camera setup  at the back, but there has been no details regarding it. Some sources suggest a  13 MP and a 12 MP camera , and it is limited to that. Inside, the phone features the latest  Snapdragon 855 SoC . So, it is no surprise that this will support the 5G network, which has so much hype these days. In addition, this phone features a  large 12 GB RAM , because…why not? If they’ve gone this far…a large RAM is a no brainer, anyway. Plus, there is a  512\xa0GB internal storage , and given that there is no slot for a microSD, it will need it.  What’s more? The phone has a  Duplex PCB Design  which has increased the available space by 20% to minimize the overall stacking space. This makes space for the 5G module inside. But with no port, how do you insert a SIM? You don’t. It will most likely have an E-SIM inside.   Furthermore, this phone is pioneering  5G technology  standardization by a fusion of technologies.  AI, IOT (Internet of Things), AR (Augmented Reality) , and  VR , and everything. This looks like a lot of steps towards the future. And the future is where this phone belongs because right now, there is no place for a phone of this kind.  Vivo seems to know this all too well too. So, this is a concept phone for now. It will not retail or ship anywhere, but will only showcase itself on the Mobile World Congress 2019. Vivo Apex of 2018 was also a similar concept phone. And many of its features showed up on the other phones later. So, maybe, we’re looking forward to a bezel-less, notch-less phone sometime soon, but I hope they have a selfie camera, though. At least, inside the display itself when they do develop such camera sensors.  We do have a similar phone like this one. The  Meizu Zero  has the same hole-less design but does pack a selfie camera up top on a very small bezel. However, it has only wireless charging.  So, yeah…this is a bizarre kind of a “thing” for a phone. We can clearly see the effort to innovate, but for who? And why? If not anything, it is very interesting though.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/vivo-apex-2019-unveiled.jpg']
['Lenovo Watch X Plus Review – The very basics of a Smartwatch'],"['Lenovo', 'Reviews', 'Smartwatch Price in Nepal']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 24, 2019']",2019-01-24 09:03:12+00:00,"['When it comes to smartwatches, you either have to spend a lot of money on something with a ton of features that you don’t really use, or go for  Fitbit  for the very basics. And the problem with Fitbit it that they don’t look like a watch. And so, Lenovo brought the Watch X and the Watch X Plus, which is a considerable improvement over the Watch 9. But with all it packs, it is simply the very basics of a smartwatch that looks like a regular watch.  Lenovo Watch X Plus Specifications:   Design : Round Medical Steel casing (stainless steel + zinc alloy), water-proof up to 80 meters  Colors : Black, Sliver, Gold (Special Edition)  Strap : Milan bracelet strap, Leather strap (special edition)  Display : 42.5mm Sapphire Crystal Glass with OLED display inside  Battery : 600 mAh battery  Storage : No storage  Sensors : Barometer, Pedometer, Heart Rate Monitor, Blood Pressure Sensor, Geomagnetic sensor, Gravity sensor  Activity Trackers : Sleep, Walking, Running, Climbing, Swimming  Features : Notification from certain apps, Calls and texts, Alarm, Remote Shutter  Price : Rs.12000 ($98 international) / Rs. 14500 (Rose Gold Special Edition)    BUY HERE  Design and Display  The Lenovo Watch X Plus is quite appealing in terms of looks. It looks like your regular wristwatch with its classic design. You can easily mistake it for a regular watch because it really looks like one. A  Medical steel casing  with  Sapphire Crystal glass  is what you get on this watch with a dial on the side.         With Roman Numbering on the dial inside, it is your traditional wear except that you get a small rectangular display on the inside. And that’s the only thing that will clear your doubt that it is not an ordinary watch. You can navigate the features with the crown on the side, that acts as a button. The watch measures  42.5 mm  and is about  12 mm thick . This watch is also  waterproof up to 80 meters , which is a good feature to have in a budget smartwatch.   The watch is available in two variants – Black or Silver, and both of them have a  Milan bracelet strap  with magnetic closure. However, there is a special Gold version of the watch as well, with a leather strap, and I had the privilege of using that one. And I must say, that looks very classy on your wrist.  Battery  This is an aspect where most smartwatches tend to struggle. The likes of  Samsung Galaxy Watch \xa0can only last for some 2-3 days, while the  Huawei Watch GT  has managed up to 15 days of battery life\xa0but that doesn’t pack as many features. This one can give you an impressive battery life of like 40 days. That, in part, is due to its  large 600 mAh battery  and the other part is because this watch doesn’t do all that much.   The watch does take some  2.5 hours to charge , but once you charge it, it lasts over a month. So, there is nothing to complain about. But you don’t have that traditional micro USB charger here. You get a  magnetic connection  on the charger, so, be careful not to lose it.  Performance  As aforementioned, the Lenovo Watch X Plus doesn’t do much. It has  6 sensors  – barometer, pedometer, heart rate monitor, a blood pressure sensor, a geomagnetic sensor, and a gravity sensor. These sensors help in good fitness tracking for day to day activities.  For fitness tracking, the watch measures your  sleep, walking, running, climbing, swimming, heart rate  and  blood pressure . But not all of them is that easy to use. Walking is tracked by default, and it also shows you the number of steps and calories burnt. But it does not save the record in the app for walking. However, it does for others and all of the data can be viewed on the  Lenovo Watch app  on your phone. It is also pretty easy to trick this smartwatch into thinking that you’re swimming. Just start the Swim activity on your watch, and move your hands around. And it will calculate your heart rate, the duration of the exercise and the number of strokes. So, some of it may not be very accurate.      Lenovo Watch X Plus   1  of 5               Activity         Health Monitor         Sleep Tracker         Steps Tracker         Barometer                           For other activities like climbing and running, the tracker is pretty accurate. It calculates the duration, calories burnt, and heart rate during the activity too. However, these two activities can be done without wearing the watch as well, from the  Lenovo Watch App  itself. It works like any other fitness app on the phone, but I doubt the tracking will be as accurate. Just for the record, you can do it.  The watch sleep tracker seems pretty good too. Although it does not store your records for sleeping, you can view it on the watch itself each day. The sleep tracker tracks the amount of sleep, the time when you slept and the time when you got up. That’s pretty good for a sleep tracker even if it not may be as comprehensive.      Lenovo Watch App    1  of 5               Profile         My Watch         Profile Settings         Alerts         App Notifications                           Other functions include regular Alarms and Reminders. However, both of these are not as useful. The alarm has to be set from the phone app, and it can be pretty difficult to do so for first-time users as the UI can be a bit difficult to get used to. But, as for the alarm, the watch only vibrates for a very brief time, and it can be easy to miss. Reminders mean getting notifications on your wrist. It vibrates to let you know when you’re getting a call or a text. But getting notification from other apps are pretty limited. You can only choose from a preset of a handful of apps like Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Skype and a bunch of other not so popular apps like WeChat and Line.  Some functions like Weather\xa0and Blood Pressure measuring do not work though, and it is more of the apps fault than the watch. But it will also remind you to move if you’ve been in the same position for too long!  But one interesting feature in this watch, which others miss out is the  Remote Shutter . And if you don’t get it, the watch lets you take pictures from your phone. Meaning, if you want to take like a group selfie or something like that, you can set the phone down and make it take pictures with the Watch. Sure, it might not be very useful, but it can come in handy sometimes. And it is something so simple but other watches didn’t think to include that!  Navigating and Setup  Being a very basic smartwatch, it is a bit difficult to get around to all its features at first. You can only navigate using the crown. You press it once to switch between features and don’t press anything to get inside it. And if something is running, like your swimming workout, for example, you long-press the crown to make it stop. It can take a while to get used to. Having two buttons could have made things simpler, but you cannot expect a lot from such a smartwatch, so, it’s okay.  Setting up is another thing though. You have to download the Lenovo Watch App from the Play Store first. You can also do so by scanning the QR code on the paperwork in the box, but that’ll lead you to download the app with Chinese interface by default. The watch connects to your phone via Bluetooth and is turned on on the watch by default. It will also ask you to turn on your phone’s location. Then, you can scan for devices from the app, and when you see your watch, connect to it. The strange thing, however, is that your phone will not show the watch in connected devices.  Calibrating the time is pretty confusing. The dial and the digital screen shows two different times at the beginning. While the digital screen syncs automatically with the time on your phone, the same cannot be said for the dial. You have to select the Calibration app on your app, which will prompt you to enter the current time. But, you have to enter the time the dial is showing currently, not the time on your phone. This can be very confusing, but it is what it is.  Conclusion  The Watch X Plus, again, is a very basic smartwatch. It does not pack a lot of comprehensive features but then again, you get this for  close to a $100 . And for that price, it looks like a really classy time-piece on your wrist. And in Nepal, you can buy get it for about  Rs.12000 – Rs.14000 , depending on the color.  It has all the characteristics of your regular classic wristwatch – sapphire crystal glass medical steel case with an optional leather strap. And it does all the things a normal person would want. This may not be suitable for body builders or extreme fitness enthusiasts, or, if you want cutting edge tech on your wrist, but for the normal layman – it has a\xa0good amount of features. It is safe to say that it is a Fitbit, but one that looks like a classy watch, and does not cost a lot of money.\xa0Plus, you don’t have to charge it every other night. And this is something you can wear on all occasions – formal parties or any type of casual wear.  Granted that some features don’t work all that well, but for the price, I’m willing to let that slide. Mostly, because it has that elegant look that most smartwatches fall short of, and it doesn’t cost as much as a luxury item.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lenovo-watch-x-plus-review.jpg']
['Meizu Zero eliminates physical buttons and features a no hole design'],['Meizu'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['January 24, 2019']",2019-01-24 07:32:54+00:00,"['Meizu Zero is the world’s first portless smartphone. Based on the company’s “Wireless Wins Cable Technology”, this phone doesn’t even offer a USB port. Basically, it lacks any physical openings, including the headphone jack and a SIM card slot. A bold move from the company, however, might not deliver a lot in terms of sales figures.  A Holeless Design  Meizu  claims the smartphone comes with Zero ‘holes’, and adds speaker cutouts to its exclusion list. The phone is actually pretty functional, the lack of USB ports is tented by 18W fast wireless charging. That’s the only way to recharge the battery of this smartphone. If you want data transfers, you are stuck with either Wi-Fi or mobile data.  While on that subject, there are no SIM slots and you will have to rely on eSIM\xa0technology. The headphone jack has already been eliminated by so many smartphone manufacturers, it’s not even an issue here. There are no loudspeakers either, thanks to the\xa0use of something called the “ piezoelectric transducer ” that creates the necessary vibrations.         Finally, all of the physical buttons have been replaced by “Virtual Side Buttons”. It uses haptic feedback to emulate the feel of\xa0pressing a real button. This hasn’t faired so well in the past, but iPhone 7 did a pretty good job so, why not here. As for security, it comes with an in-display fingerprint sensor, a pretty routine feature in flagships these days.  We have seen all of these features implemented in phones before, but this is the first time all of it made it to one single device. That’s exactly what makes this so unique. While on the subject, the Meizu Zero does come with two small holes. Those are the microphone openings at the bottom, but that’s probably just our stickler behavior.  Read More:\xa0 Vivo Y89 with a notched display, dual rear cameras launched in China  Flagship Specs  Meizu seems to have done a lot to make it a portless smartphone, mostly on it’s exterior. It’s only fair to assume a steller internal spec sheet, and it does. It comes with a 5.99″ (1080 x 2340 pixels) AMOLED display with\xa0an in-display fingerprint sensor and\xa0loudspeakers beneath the display itself.  The bezels both the top and the bottom are pretty minimal. Noticeably, it does not come with a notch, but a traditional type selfie camera. The sensor is just a part of the top bezel and it looks good, at least on paper. A one-piece ceramic unibody holds everything together, think  Galaxy S9 , but better (in terms of design and feel).  Performance wise, it gets a  Snapdragon 845 SoC  paired with the Adreno 630 GPU. Although, a bit old with  SD855  phones coming in pretty hot, this one looks a bit outdated. But it’s still a pretty capable chipset none-the-less. Common specs like RAM and storage remain unknown, but we do know there is no SD card support.  Read More:\xa0 Xiaomi’s Foldable Phone has more folds to flaunt  Fairly basic camera setup  It gets a dual camera setup with a 12MP (Sony IMX380 sensor) and a 20MP (Sony IMX350 sensor) unit at the back. The primary 12MP camera is an f/1.8, 27mm wide-angle lens with a\xa01.55µm\xa0sensor and 4-axis OIS. The secondary 20MP camera is an f/2.6 aperture lens which supports the usual AI enhancement features.   Below the dual-camera setup resides a 6-LED ring flash. At the front, there is a 20MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture and AI face unlock support. It looks to be a pretty small sensor and is tucked in nicely right at the middle of the top bezel. The forehead itself is pretty slim, so you get the point.  It comes with a pretty well-rounded seamless design, inspired with the help of a ceramic body and as the name suggests, Zero openings. All sides are basically empty, apart from the cameras at the back and front, two microphones at the bottom and that AMOLED display at the front. It will come in Black and White color options and gets an IP68 rating.  As for now, a chunk of its specs still remains unknown, one of which is the pricing and availability.

['Xiaomi’s Foldable Phone has more folds to flaunt'],['Xiaomi'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 24, 2019']",2019-01-24 06:33:29+00:00,"['Foldable smartphones looked very interesting since it was but a concept. And now, with  Royole’s Flex Pai  – the world’s first foldable smartphone, companies are trying to one-up the other by coming out with their own versions of foldable smartphones. While Samsung is expected to unveil Galaxy X – its foldable phone, Xiaomi has its own set of tricks ready. And Xiaomi’s foldable phone has three folds!  Xiaomi revealed its prototype of the foldable phone on Weibo. In addition to revealing it will have three folds, the company also asked the public to help name it. The phone when unfolded looks like a tablet. But then, it folds from the right and the left as well, to give the appearance of a smaller mobile device. It is all on video on Xiaomi’s social media networks, where Bin Lin, Xiaomi co-founder and the president himself, is using the device.         What benefits does this double-folding have? To be honest, we have no clue. But this design looks more interesting than your regular double-folding smartphone. And it probably has piqued everyone’s interest in it easily than Samsung’s foldable phone. But then again, the cost of this phone will probably be very steep, as this will be the first of its kind. And another question is what will these phones have to offer besides its foldable design for the price?  We will have to wait and see. For now, the only foldable phone that exists for sale is the Royole Flex Pai. Xiaomi’s foldable phone does not have a name yet…nor the specs or any other features. Samsung should unveil theirs along with the  Galaxy S10  series on February. And other companies like Huawei and Motorola also have plans for the same in 2019.

['It’s high time for Vivo to bring online exclusive phones'],"['Opinion', 'Vivo']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['January 23, 2019']",2019-01-23 12:24:34+00:00,"['Vivo recently announced that it would launch Vivo Apex 2019 on January 24. The company teased the phone with the water droplet. Vivo also released a blind test video on its Weibo page, which includes reaction from passerby after letting them feel the phone in their hands. The people who felt the phone on their hands describe it as a pebble, soap, and so on. This gave us an idea that the phone will have a sleek body and will incorporate a glass on its back.  We have no doubts that Vivo Apex 2019 will look stunningly great in terms of design and will also pack some noteworthy features inside. The company had released the concept phone last year as  Vivo Apex with pop-up selfie camera  in  MWC 2018 . And it had also been a pioneer on bringing the smartphone with an under-display fingerprint sensor in the past. So we really have high hopes from the smartphone maker in the flagship bracket even this time around.  Even on the midrange segment, Vivo brings come praiseworthy devices.  Vivo V11 (Vivo V11i globally)  and  Vivo V11 Pro (Vivo V11 globally)  were good devices. And owing to the rumors,  Vivo V15 and Vivo V15 Pro  will be equally compelling.        But the lesser known fact, Vivo also has its own lineup of budget smartphones. The Y-series smartphones from Vivo are typically budget-centric handsets. And the Vivo’s Y-series smartphones in a budget price segment doesn’t look so compelling. The price of the Y-series handsets is rather exorbitant and they do not seem to offer much value when compared to its competitors. The company recently launched the Vivo Y89, which do not have any outstanding features when compared to its competitors. Have a look at the quick specs overview below.  Vivo Y89 vs the competition      Vivo Y89  Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro  ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2  Realme 2 Pro    6.26-inch Full-HD+ IPS display  A 6.26-inch Full-HD+ IPS display  6.26-inch Full-HD+ IPS display  6.3-inch Full-HD+ IPS display    Snapdragon 626 chipset  Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset  Snapdragon 660 chipset  Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset    4GB RAM  3/4/6GB RAM  3/4/6GB RAM  4/6/8GB RAM    64GB  32/64GB  64/128GB  32/64GB    16MP + 2MP Rear camera  12MP +\xa0 5MP Rear Camera  16MP + 2MP Rear camera  12MP +\xa0 5MP Rear Camera    16MP, f/2.0 front camera  20MP + 2MP front camera  13MP, f/2.0 front camera  16MP, f/2.0 front camera    3260mAh battery  4000mAh battery  5000mAh battery  3500mAh battery    $237 (4/64GB)  $211 (4/64GB)  $183 (3/32GB)  $183 (4/64GB)      In the above comparison table, we can easily see that all the other smartphones pack a better punch when compared to the Vivo Y89. It should also be noticed that except the Vivo Y89 all the aforementioned smartphones are online exclusive in the market.  When a smartphone goes through the offline route, it goes through various distribution channels (national distributor, regional distributor, etc.). Different types of costs (banners, pamphlets, and leaflets for offline marketing, transportation costs, etc.) are involved. So, when the smartphone reaches the consumers’ end, the  smartphone tends to get expensive . And that’s one of the reasons why the Vivo Y-series smartphones tend to be expensive. But that’s not all, Vivo has also been involved in sponsorship of different events. We saw Vivo being the main sponsor for the World Cup 2018, Indian Premier League (IPL) 2018 and so on.  After all these years of being in the smartphone market, Vivo has already garnered a tremendous amount of goodwill. And its pioneering innovations have also created an upsurge in its popularity. So it may not be an exaggeration if I say that Vivo doesn’t require so much of investment for the brand awareness in the present time. So what I think would be better for Vivo is that the brand should now focus aggressively on RnD (research and developments), which the brand seems to be doing it somewhat already. Other than that, Vivo should also focus on bringing bang for buck devices even in the budget price bracket. For the brand, which has already been renowned for their camera-centric approach and pioneering innovations, the online market can also be flourishing.  The online encroachment of Xiaomi, Huawei, and Oppo in the budget price segment with the sub-brand handsets like Redmi, Honor, and Realme is quite blooming. And the sales from the competitors is also hampering the sales of the Vivo phones. So it looks like it’s high time for Vivo to bring online exclusive phones packing a better punch than its present phones.

Not just the announcement, the smartphone is also up for purchase through the AliExpress in the Chinese market. Just like all the previous Y-series, the handset is tagged with a budget-friendly price.  Vivo Y89 Specs Overview  On the display front, the smartphone comes with a 6.26-inch IPS panel featuring a notch on the top. But the notch here is rather wide and obtrusive than the teardrop/waterdrop style notch found on the more expensive  Vivo V11  and  Vivo V11 Pro . The screen on the device comes in a tall and narrow form factor boasting Full-HD+ resolution. \xa0So we can expect that there won’t be any lack in sharpness on its screen.         On the rear panel of the device lies the “Vivo” logo, a fingerprint sensor and a dual camera setup all with golden accents. These golden accents have further embellished the phone.  The device is powered by Snapdragon 626 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. We have seen the same hardware configuration in the Vivo V9 in the past. So we can expect a similar performance here.  Talking about the cameras, the phone enjoys a 16MP primary camera on the back accompanied by a 2MP depth sensor. So this device is capable of capturing portrait images as well. On the front, a 16MP selfie shooter resides meticulously on the notch.  On the software side of things, the Vivo Y89 boosts with Android Oreo out of the box with Vivo’s custom skin on the top. Moving on to the battery, there is a 3260mAh non-removable battery to keep things going.

The device is on the shelf of AliExpress and is available for purchase in China at the moment. On the storage side, there is just a single variant (4/64GB), which is priced at CNY 1598 (equivalent to $235, INR 16,750, NPR 27,000) on the e-commerce website.   As far as the availability of the device outside is concerned, Vivo has not yet spoken anything on the topic.

This new sensor is made especially for the new Punch-hole cameras as claimed by the company.  Also Read:\xa0 Samsung Exynos 7904, a mid-range SoC “Customized for India”  The new Isocell Slim 3T2 is based on Samsung’s  Isocell Plus technology.  It features a  20 MP resolution  on a tiny  1/3.4″ form factor . This makes it the smallest camera sensor at present in the market. The sensor has a  0.8-micrometer pixel size  and includes Tetracell  pixel binning technology  – that combines more pixels into one for better low light images and such. The same kind of technology is being used in the  Samsung GM1 sensor  that is found in the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 . This technology is how smartphones can equip large 48 MP cameras on them even if their processors cannot process such large images. However, the Slim 3T2 sensor is different from the GM1 in the sense that when there is not much light, it can act like a regular 5 MP sensor with 1.6-micrometer pixels.         This new sensor is also capable of functioning as a main camera for telephoto purposes. To do so, it uses a standard RGB color filter rather than the Tetracell array. This reduces the pixels height further by about 7%. But still manages to yield\xa0 60% more effective resolution  at 10X digital zoom compared to a standard 13 MP camera.  All of these functionalities make the camera suitable for a wide range of applications. But for now, Samsung seems content advertising it as the  best suitable camera for punch-hole displays  and notches. Because, of course, it is the smallest camera sensor as claimed by the company. We probably will see this camera in other usage scenarios, too, when it does come out. It is soon to go into production by the first quarter of 2019.  So, yes, we will not be able to see this camera on the  Galaxy S10  or S10 series. But it is very likely to make its presence in other phones to come out later this year.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/samsung-isocell-slim-3t2.jpg']

And Motorola was expected to  release their new Moto G7 series this year in the MWC (Mobile World Congress) in 2019 , but it might not be so. And of course, it is very rare for smartphones to launch without some leaks and stuff. As speculated before, Motorola is going to launch 4 smartphones in the G7 series, namely, the  Moto G7, Moto G7 Plus, Moto G7 Power  and  Moto G7 Play .  Judging by the names, the four phones might have very less difference between each of them. But here we have the specs they pack from an official listing source.  Motorola Moto G7  The Motorola G7 is the base model of the G7 series. It features a good sized  6.24″ IPS LCD display  with a  Full HD+ resolution  and 19:9 aspect ratio. And standing by the norms of the latest fad, this phone comes with a  water-drop notch  on the display.         This phone packs dual cameras at the back, which, again stands by the current trends. The  dual camera setup  comprises of a 12 MP primary camera with f/1.8 aperture and a 5 MP depth sensor. The  selfie camera is an 8 MP sensor . Under the hood, it is powered by a  Snapdragon 632 chip  coupled with  4 GB RAM  and  64 GB storage . The phone runs on a  3000 mAh battery .  Motorola Moto G7 Plus  As the name goes, it is a slightly beefier version of the Moto G7. On the outside, it looks the same with the same display and the notch. The difference lies in some of the other aspects.  Source: OnLeaks  It, too, has  dual cameras  but this one packs a  slightly better camera . A 16 MP primary lens with f/1.7 aperture and a 5 MP depth sensor. Up front too, you get a 1 2 MP selfie camera . This one is powered by a slightly more powerful  Snapdragon 636 chipset  and  4 GB RAM . It runs on the same  3000 mAh battery , but for some reason, is slightly thicker than the Moto G7.  Motorola Moto G7 Power  If you go by the name, it would suggest that this would be a more beefier version of the Moto G7 or the G7 Plus. But the “Power” in the name stands for the  large 5000 mAh battery  it packs, that can last you for more than 2 days.   It is larger than the other two phones but has the same  6.24″ LCD display  with 19:9 aspect ratio. But, it only comes in HD+ resolution and a regular wide notch on the screen. Camera wise, there’s only a  single 12 MP camera  with f/2.0 aperture and an 8 MP camera up front. A  Snapdragon 632  powers the phone with  3 GB RAM , and it comes with  32 GB internal storage .  Motorola Moto G7 Play  This is the most toned down version of the G7 series and it is also smaller in size. This phone comes with a  5.7″ IPS display  with  HD+ resolution  and 19:9 aspect ratio. It also has a single  13 MP camera  at the back and an 8 MP selfie camera.   Inside, the Moto G7 Play is powered by  Snapdragon 632  chipset and  2 GB RAM . It has  32 GB storage  and  3000 mAh  of battery.  All the phones of the G7 series come with the latest  Android 9.0 Pie . Also, all of these claim to have a  rear-mounted fingerprint sensor  and Motorola’s  TurboCharger  fast charging. The prices, however, have not been revealed as of yet. These phones should launch on February 7 in Brazil before the MWC 2019.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/motorola-moto-g7-series.jpg']

These are the phones that are available in almost the same price as the Mi 8 Lite and provide almost identical specs. So, can the Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite stand out in the plethora of mid-range devices out there? Let’s find out!  First of all, let’s clear out the name game here! Xiaomi has released 3 smartphones in the mi 8 Lineup, the  Mi 8 , which is a flagship variant, the  MI 8 SE  and the Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite which are cheaper variants where the Mi 8 Lite is the most affordable among all.         Xiaomi MI 8 Lite Specifications:   Display : 6.26-inch IPS LCD display with 2.5D curved glass on the top  Resolution : Full-HD+ (2280×1080 pixels), 19:9 aspect ratio  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 660  CPU : Octa-core\xa0(4x 2.2GHz Kryo 260 + 4x 1.8GHz Kryo 260)  GPU : Adreno 512  RAM : 4GB LPDDR4 RAM  Storage : 64GB; Expandable up to 256GB  OS & UI : Android Oreo with MIUI 10 on the top; Upgradable to Android Pie (v9.0)  Rear Camera : 12 MP f/1.9 + 5 MP, f/2.0 depth sensor with LED flash  Front Camera : 24MP  Battery : 3350mAh battery with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support  Connectivity : Wi-Fi 802.11 a/c/b/g/n, WiFi Direct, Hotspot, Bluetooth 5.0, no 3.5mm headphone jack, USB Type-C, USB OTG support  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Price (4/64GB) : Rs. 31,999   Design  From the design standpoint, we see improvements in the latest version. There are curvy edges, an  attractive glass back , and a shiny  aluminum border  with  2.5D curved glass . But topping it all is the colors and this gradient color variant is amazingly eye-catching.  Also read:  Xiaomi mobiles price in Nepal  There is a fingerprint reader at the back, just like how we find it in other Xiaomi phones, and does its job quite well. The scanning is fast and does it correctly all the time. We didn’t find a Face unlock option, which is strange for a smartphone of 2019!  The phone is premium on hold but is slightly wider than others out there. That didn’t make a difference in usage though, just putting it out there. The camera bump creates some imbalance when the phone is kept on a plane surface, carrying chances of getting the cameras scratched overtime which Xiaomi has well addressed by proving a Silicon case with the phone.   Talking about the back, as attractive it is to the normal eye, it is a fingerprint magnet, no denying that. The phone feels good on hands but it’s sad that a cover needs be used to protect it from smudges and prints.  So, on the design front, the phone is what we would expect from a current smartphone. But it’s noteworthy that no cutouts have been made in this area.  Display  The display is also one of the best things about the Mi 8 Lite. It’s a  6.26 inch IPS LCD panel  with a tall  19:9 aspect ratio  and  1080p resolution . This might sound as if we are getting a usual thing, but the display here is pretty dope, I mean the colors, brightness and the calibration all fit in perfectly to give you a pleasing display. It’s a sharp one with very good viewing angles. The sunlight legibility is decent and nothing extraordinary.  In terms of display size, it might be a little less than the 6.5-inch seen on Y9 2019 and the Honor 8X, but that is no major setback here.   On the top, you get a notch that is not, well, an ugly one. It’s smaller than the MI 8 SE and similar to the Honor 8X and Y9 2019. You do have an option to hide it, but the black bar on the top is clearly visible at certain angles. Again, not that big of an issue, just putting it out there.  Cameras   Okay, let’s jump to the cameras now. The cameras here feature a similar setup like the MI 8 SE. There are a  12+5 MP dual cameras  at the back that works just fine. The colors are good and the pictures from the normal cameras look decent, nothing extraordinary. The dynamic range is average and with the HDR on, you get some improvements. The AI feature that’s there gives you some punchiness in images and nothing more.

At times, the amount of blur is very very uneven and it looks unnatural too. Similarly, the dual cameras suffer poor edge detection.

In extreme low light conditions, there are grains all over and as the light gets better, the pictures look better too. Focus, during night time, is slow. However, the shots are good in artificial lighting though.  The selfies I got from this one is actually great. There is some processing being done, you cannot shut it off but the output is not bad at all. It’s a  24 MP  camera that gives you good results. The portrait mode, though with a single camera, is surprisingly good, better than the back camera actually! Night time selfies are a bit noisy though.      Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite selfie samples   1  of 5                                                                    In the video part, you get options for recording in 1080p at 60 or 30 fps, 4k at 30 fps and 720p at 30 fps. The device has EIS and the videos are more stabilized, except while recording in 4k. The 1080p at 30 fps has better quality and stabilization.  Performance:  Now, the performance! The Snapdragon 660 seems like a sweet spot for Xiaomi. It’s there on the Mi A2 and the recently announced Redmi Note 7. It’s not a bad chipset by any means, but it seems like Xiaomi has standardized the chipset to be used on its midrange smartphones. The performance is what we would expect. Switching between apps is fluid and multitasking is fine too. But when put in comparison with the Kirin 710 of the Huawei Y9, apps open a little slow on the Mi 8 Lite.   However, when talking about the GPU performance, games load faster in the Mi 8 Lite than the Huawei Y9 2019. Not a major difference here.  Gameplay is smooth with  Adreno 512  counterpart, I played PUBG and Asphalt 9 and only in PUBG, I felt some stutters. Everything else ran fine. But with games running in the background, when I try to switch to another app, the phone becomes a bit legarthic, just a bit! Maybe this could be fixed with a software update.  Software and UI:  Talking about the software, you get  Android Oreo 8.1  with  MIUI 10.0.5 . The Redmi Note 6 pro had some issues with advertisements playing even in the file explorer. I expected the same, but, nothing of that sort happened.  Moving on, the notifications can be cleared from one direction only, which can be very confusing to people. But the animations going around inside the settings menu is quite fun I must say. And I might be saying this very late, but I also very much like the brightness panel and the volume rocker panel. And if you are a fan of gesture navigation, don’t worry you get that too in here!

There is a 6 GB RAM, 128 GB internal storage version available too! So, at this price, the storage offered is pretty decent.  Battery:  Okay, get let’s get on to the battery side of things. The Mi 8 Lite features a  3350 mAh  battery. And, we very well know that the SD 660 is slightly less power efficient than the Kirin 710. Plus with the 4,000 mAh battery on the Huawei Y9 2019, the Mi 8 Lite is nowhere comparable. And talking about the endurance, you get average battery life that makes you put this on charge at the end of the day. Similarly, gaming drains the battery at a considerably faster pace. Nonetheless, it will get you through the day. The device supports quick charge 3.0 but you get a 10-watt charger in the box. Using the QC 3.0 charger improves the charging time significantly.   Also, you cannot ignore the fact that you get a USB Type C port here. It won’t be wrong saying that Xiaomi is very generous in providing the latest on the hardware side.  Extras:  Onto the extras, the speakers get moderately loud on video and music playback. But when headphones are plugged in the output is not so loud from the type C port. Yes, you got it, there is no headphone jack! While some of you may accept it, this might turn off many of you. The buttons are placed at a reachable distance and are clicky and hefty too.  Conclusion:  The Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite has been launched at a time when there is a cluster of devices in the same price range. It is a good device with good performance and good everything and you will not regret buying it today for the price being asked. But, but it’s not going to be a regret buying the Honor 8X, the Redmi 6 Pro or the Y9 2019 either! The Mi 8 Lite is just another addition to the choices.  And, in anyways, if the Redmi 7 makes its way early in Nepal, it’s not going to hard choose it over the Mi 8 Lite. So, overall, it’s a good device but there are other choices out in the market that can easily replace this one.     Pros  Cons    Appealing design  No 3.5mm Headphone Jack    Good display  Average battery life    Good performance  Subpar low light camera performance    Good front and Back cameras  Poor background blurring in portrait images']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Xiaomi-MI-8-Lite-review.jpg']
['Deal Alert: Four Sony Smartphones received a price cut in Nepal'],"['Deals', 'Sony', 'Sony Xperia']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['January 22, 2019']",2019-01-22 03:21:41+00:00,"['Sony smartphones are basically known for their awe-inspiring cameras. The Japanese tech giant always promises to cater more especially on the camera department, be it a flagship handset or budget-friendly devices. And the good news here is that the Same brand has slashed the price of four of its camera-centric smartphones. And at the new price, the smartphones pack plenty of punch.  Also Read:  Sony Camera Price in Nepal  Sony Xperia X  When it comes to the display, the Sony Xperia X may not meet the today’s standard as it lacks bezel-less design and trendy 18:9 aspect ratio. Nonetheless, the 5-inch display on the device looks pleasantly sharp at Full-HD resolution.         On the performance front, the smartphone boasts Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 chipset coupled with 3GB of RAM. The chipset is rather old and is manufactured on 28nm architecture. Nonetheless, it is excelsior when it comes to the performance. It even outperforms the Snapdragon 625 chipset, which is found on smartphones like  Xiaomi MI A2 Lite  and  Redmi 5 Plus . But the SD650 tends to get heat more when compared with the likes of SD625. Talking about the memory on the phone, there is 64GB of onboard storage. 64GB of storage is sufficient for most of the users. And considering the price, the amount of storage is quite huge as most of the smartphones at the same price bracket usually come with 16/32GB of storage.  In the camera department, the phone looks equally great. There is a 23MP rear camera and a 13MP camera, which are capable of capturing some jaw-dropping photos. Since Sony is an excellent player in the camera game, you can easily see its camera prowess here. So with all these amazing features, the Sony Xperia X is surely one of the  best smartphones in Nepal under Rs. 20,000 of price .

And no doubt, the image quality will be any different here. Even on the front, there is a capable 8MP shooter.  On the display front, the big bezels on the top and on the bottom may be frustrating for the most. But when only the display is considered, the Xperia XA1 is one of the best phone out there. The device comes with Full-HD resolution at sub 15,000 price bracket, which is absolutely a rare feature. On the top, the display is shielded with Scratch-resistant glass. So even your smartphone slips or falls through your hands, there is a rare chance of cracks and scratches to appear on the screen.   There is Helio P20 chipset on the performance front, which is paired with 3GB of RAM. Helio P20 may not be the best performer out there but considering the price, there is nothing to complain. But the presence of 2300 mAh battery may be not sufficient for everyone. So you might have to plug it to the wall charger quite often.

['Netflix’s Black Mirror Bandersnatch Interactive Film review: Is it any good?'],['Netflix'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['January 21, 2019']",2019-01-21 11:10:37+00:00,"['Is it a game? or is it a movie? It’s actually a “Netflix Interactive Flim for Adults”, according to the popular streaming service provider. And yes, we have seen this countless times before, be it with Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead. But what makes this particular one special is the production value,\xa0the fact that its actual camera work and very less CGI or animations.  If you are optimistic enough the graphics quality can be defined as excellent, unlike any other video game in the market right now. Plus the storyline is pretty great, or not that great, depends on your choices. Netflix has done the concept justice, and if you have played it, I’m sure you would agree\xa0on that.  How does it work?         Every now and then, the movie gives you choices (you get 10 seconds to choose), basically getting to control the main character. And the same define how the film begins, how it plays out and how it ends. It starts off with something simple like the brand of serial the main character starts the day with, Frosties or Sugar Puffs. Giving you a feel for the game, giving you the control, what you can expect from it before it gets violent, or not, it’s still up to you.  Storyline  [A disclaimer, this is a spoiler-free review]  So the storyline, you can end up with one of five different endings. Each with their own different storyline, their own different adventures, and their own different concepts. If you opt not to choose either of the options, the movie will play out with default choices and you basically end up with the least exciting scripting and the plainest ending possible.   If you opt to control the character, you are in for an exciting movie. It does a great job of engaging the viewer, keeping them interested, frustrated, sad and\xa0best of all\xa0have a bit of fun throughout the movie. It was quite a unique experience, to say the least. To be fair, it’s still a Black Mirror Episode and they kinda have their own way of seizing the attention of its audience.  Conclusion  Bandersnatch  was definitely something unique, but sadly if you want the full experience you will have to subscribe to Netflix.\xa0You can download the pirated version but the interaction part is missing. It does take most of the fun out of the movie and it feels pretty boring. Other bad news is Netflix raising it’s pricing, thanks to the popularity of shows like Birdbox and Sex Education. They also posted a huge 35% YoY growth with almost 29 million new subscribers.   Don’t do it.  pic.twitter.com/dZUeyxW50x  — Black Mirror (@blackmirror)  27 December 2018   Either way, Bandersnatch definitely offers a great experience and is definitely worth a shot. Bringing the vague difference between movies and games even closer, the transition between choices was, well, as seamless as it could have been. Given that the movie just took 35 days in the shooting, and almost 2 years in the making, it was definitely not rushed, unlike the movie itself. So, if you want to watch it, you can click  here  to subscribe to Netflix, or just download the pirated version, which we fully discourage.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Black-Mirror-Bandersnatch.jpg']

['Samsung Galaxy M10 and M20 prices leaked: Budget Category'],['Samsung'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 21, 2019']",2019-01-21 09:22:12+00:00,"['With the Samsung Galaxy M10 and M20 in the works and many of specs leaking about, it is evident that they’re coming. These two phones are actually set to be unveiled on January 28 in India as an Amazon exclusive. The phones will also make their way, here, but of course, they will probably be sold offline here. But no matter what, these new Samsung entrants in the budget category is interesting.  Mostly, because the  M-series is going to replace the existing or soon-to-be-extinct Galaxy J, Galaxy C and Galaxy On series . All of those three smartphone segments combined into one will not only simplify the phone naming convention. And also, should also rectify the mistakes seen in them.  Nevertheless, we now have new rumors from the closest of Samsung’s pricing sources about the price of these two phones. And earlier, there were speculations that the Galaxy M10 would cost below $150, which is now confirmed by these price leaks. As suggested, the  Galaxy M10 will cost about $125 , give or take a few dollars; whereas the Galaxy M20 will be a bit more expensive.  The Galaxy M20 will cost around $180 . The source of these leaks confirms the Indian pricing for these phones as well, which is very close to these numbers.         In India, the  Galaxy M10 will cost INR. 8,990  and the  Galaxy M20 will cost INR. 12,990 . For the price, the phones are quite justified it seems. Because this is Samsung’s strategy to make its presence more prominent in the budget segment. As for the Nepali market, phones generally tend to be expensive here due to  these reasons . But even so, the Galaxy M10 will be priced  below Rs.20000  here. We cannot be sure about the Galaxy M20, however.   Galaxy M10  will feature a  6.2″ HD+ Infinity-V display  (Samsung’s fancy way of saying tear-drop notch), dual cameras at the back comprising  13 + 5 MP sensors ,  Exynos 7872 chip ,  2 or 3 GB RAM variants  and a  3400 mAh battery . The  Galaxy M20  will have a slightly larger  6.3″ FHD+ Infinity-V display . It will have a similar camera setup at the back with the  front camera being 8 MP . The SoC will be  Exynos 7885 , will have  3 GB RAM , and a large  5000 mAh battery . It will come in 32 / 64 GB storage variants.  So, what do you think of these upcoming Samsung budget phones?

"['Best mid-range camera smartphones in Nepal (Under Rs. 35,000)']","['Guides', 'Buy Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['January 20, 2019']",2019-01-20 09:45:57+00:00,"['Buying a smartphone is pretty daunting these days. The cheesy advertisements and the confusing benchmark numbers make us change our thoughts in no time. And among all those numerous smartphones riddled with myriads of specs and features, choosing a  good camera smartphone  is cumbersome. So to guide you to find the best camera smartphone in the midrange section, we have done an in-depth analysis of some popular and noteworthy camera smartphones in the market. Decrypting their features and unveiling the potential, we have come up with five best mid-range camera smartphones in Nepal, which outdid the others available in the similar price range.  5 Xiaomi MI 8 Lite        This new phone in the Nepali market is actually like some other phones we’ve seen before. And it bears an uncanny resemblance to the  MI 8 SE  in terms of camera. The  MI 8 Lite  packs a 12 MP primary camera accompanied by a 5 MP depth sensor at the back. The picture quality from the MI 8 Lite is not just great, but certainly good enough to earn itself a place in this list. The colors in the pictures are quite good, and the ones from the normal camera are decent, nothing extraordinary. Its HDR mode is pretty good though. And of course, this phone too packs the AI features, which gives you some punch in the photos. But we’ve seen better AI cameras elsewhere.  The portrait mode is also only okay because while the foreground comes out good, the background blur seems a bit off. And of course, there’s a bit of poor edge detection. Night shots are also only very average.  The selfie camera is what is great about this device. Its 24 MP selfie camera gives you good results, and some pictures are better than from the back camera actually! So, this combination of cameras and picture quality with its price is just enough to put this phone on our list. The Mi 8 Lite is, currently, priced at Rs.31,999. 4 Huawei Nova 3i Huawei Nova 3i  is the only smartphone on the list that comes with a quad camera setup. The phone enjoys a dual camera setup at the back. It also boasts a camera pair on the front, right on the top of the display.  On the back, the phone has a 16MP + 2MP camera. Normal pictures from the rear camera are punchy and vibrant in terms of colors and they pack in good details. However, the portrait mode is not particularly impressive as the edge detection gets jittery at times. With AI cameras, your sceneries are enhanced making them look more appealing. Other than greenery, the phone detects the objects and scenarios pretty well and enhances them. So the results images look very pleasing to the eye. But despite all the good things, night time shots from the phone are not particularly impressive. Low light images contain a substantial amount of noises and grains and the images tend to lose details.   Talking about the selfie camera, a camera pair of 24MP and 2MP sensors resides on the notch. In terms of details and colors, one can barely complain about the ability of the selfie camera on the Nova 3i. With plentiful details and natural like colors, selfies from the phone look absolutely incredible. There is an HDR Pro mode, which enhances colors. Since the selfie camera is also AI-powered, it really helps to enhance the pictures alongside the beauty mode, which just smoothens the skin and makes fairer. If you are wondering about the price, the phone is tagged with the price of Rs. 35,990 (MRP). But you can get it for Rs. 35,000 or less in the retail stores. 3 Vivo V11 The  Vivo V11 \xa0is yet another not-so-new mid-ranger device from the company. But in the camera department, it does have some aspects that shine against some others. It also packs dual cameras at the back comprising of a 16 MP camera and a 5 MP depth sensor, like most phones in 2018.   The cameras capture great photos with top-notch saturation and details. The dynamic range is covered pretty well, with it preserving good details in highlights and shadow details. The pictures do come out with a slight pinkish tint, but that’s ignorable and not very noticeable either. In terms of portrait images, there are better camera phones out there, but not in this price range of course! But the portrait photos from this one are great too.\xa0Night time or low-light images result in slightly warmer pictures, but in terms of details, it does a good enough job.  The 25 MP selfie camera is even better than the rear ones. It gathers enough light, and you’ll like the selfies on this one. The only problem is that the camera tends to smoothen the face even with the beauty mode off. Overall, this one is a great camera phone.  And the price of the phone, currently, is Rs.37,790, but you will get this phone for Rs.35000 with discounts that Vivo phones offer. 2 Xiaomi MI A2 Xiaomi MI A2  is really appealing when it comes to looks. But design is not the only aspect where the MI A2 excels, the phone also shines on the camera department.  When looked into its back, we can see a pair of cameras aligned in a vertical configuration. 12MP and 20MP sensors, both equipped with f/1.8 lenses are used on the phone to form a dual camera setup. With this camera duo, the phone edges out its competitors and shines on a lot of scenarios. The images captured from the phone have plenty of details. The captured images also boast a good dynamic range and enjoy natural colors in them. So the photos from the phone look true to life.   The portrait images from the phone also impress its users in a similar way. With proper edge detection and adding a proper amount of blurs, MI A2 imitates the high-end DSLRs quite closely. But to capture portrait images, there must be a proper distance between the subject and the camera, which can create problems at times. Also, talking about the low light portrait images, they are not really much appealing.  Despite being great on many aspects,  Xiaomi MI A1  was not so impressive in terms of selfies. But with this phone, it has changed. The Xiaomi MI A2 comes with a 20MP selfie sensor over the 5MP sensor on its predecessor, and it is not The selfie shooter on the MI A2 is not just high in terms of the megapixel count but is also remarkable when it comes to quality. It captures amazing selfies with a great amount of details and clarity. And this phone also allows you to take portrait selfies, which are good enough even if it’s just software.  The Xiaomi Mi A2 is currently priced at Rs.31000. 1 Samsung Galaxy A6+ Samsung smartphones have always been the top contender at its price when it comes to the camera and the  Samsung Galaxy A6+  is no exception. The phone comes with capable cameras both on the front and on the back to do the job sophisticatedly.  It comes with dual rear cameras which is a combination of a 16MP sensor with f/1.7 lens backed by a 5MP depth sensor with an f/1.9 lens. The primary camera on the phone is absolutely remarkable as it captures still images with great sharpness. The photos so captured are also well saturated, possess decent dynamic range and enjoy natural colors as well. Low light shots from the phone are also praise-worthy since they preserve the details without inviting much of noises and grains in the images.   It’s depth sensor, too, really does a good job on the edge detection and on segregating the foreground and backgrounds for portrait shots. Alike all the Samsung smartphones with dual camera, the Galaxy A6+ also has a handy feature with which users can adjust the blur intensity and the focus area, which can be done both before and after taking photos. This is really a cool feature because it lets us obtain the perfect images according to our needs.  Samsung always seems to have compromised on the selfie camera. Even on its flagship handsets like the Galaxy S9+ and the Note 9, the smartphone maker has provided a merely 8MP sensor. But on the A6+, Samsung has provided a top-quality 24MP sensor. With this front shooter in action, the Galaxy A6+ captures amazing selfies with plentiful details. When it comes to the pricing, the phone demands a price of Rs. 34,890 on the purchase.  So, there you have it. If you’re looking for a good camera mid-range phone, then, these can be your best option.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/best-mid-range-camera-smartphones.jpg']

Samsung’s New Years offer saw the price drop to Rs.41000, and for a phone with a good  6″ Full HD+ AMOLED display  with an  Exynos 7885  and  4 GB RAM  was a good enough deal.

Android Pie for Samsung Galaxy Note 9  Samsung devices are most of the times late to receive the latest Android updates. But this time around, that was not the case. Samsung’s flagships of 2018\xa0 – the  Galaxy S9 ,  Galaxy S9+  and  Note 9  have been receiving Android Pie during the last couple of days.

You can do so via the Samsung Members app.  Android Pie for Huawei Nova 3 and 3i  The  Huawei Nova 3  and  Nova 3i  are also getting the latest Android Pie updates.

And for a budget phone, it was well received. The Chinese company is working on an upgraded version of the Lenovo A5, dubbed the Lenovo A5s. And while there are some rumors hanging around the budget phone, we have an exclusive first look for you!  Lenovo A5s Overview  The Lenovo A5s has a pretty old school design with bezels and a chin. Of course, for a budget phone, this is not uncommon either. The body is plastic with a glossy finish. The back panel is removable, and there is a removable battery inside – pretty uncommon these days. But given that the SIM slots are inside, that’s all well. There are two SIM slots – one micro and the other nano. There is an SD card slot inside as well.         The build of the phone looks good. The back panel is pretty stubborn to open too. The glossy finish attracts a lot of finger smudges though. The power button and volume buttons are on the right and overall, the phone looks good enough for the budget category.   The display is a  5.72″ IPS LCD panel  with HD+ resolution but  CPU-Z  and  My Device  showed different pixel measurement. CPU-Z shows a standard of 1440 x 720 whereas My Device measures 1344 x 720. Nevertheless, the HD+ resolution on a\xa0 budget phone is good enough.  In terms of camera, it packs a  single 13 MP camera at the back  and a  13 MP camera up front  as well. This is a budget phone, so, I would not expect too much from the camera, though. However, the UI is very simple. There is only a normal mode, and not much else to see. I don’t know if this is only on the unit we got our hands on or all retailing models, but that’s that.   Under the hood, the phone runs on  MT6761 processor , which is more commonly known as  Helio A22 chipset . There is  2 GB RAM  in it, and a  16 GB of onboard storage . But since there is a microSD card slot, it is not a deal breaker. However, the Lenovo A5 had a 3 GB RAM, so, we might also see another 3 GB variant of the phone as well.  We had seen the chipset on the  Xiaomi Redmi 6A  with the same RAM and storage configuration. Not just the hardware setup, the performance of the device was also identical. Light apps and games ran pretty smoothly and app switching was also pleasingly decent. So there is nothing much to complain here when the pricing is considered.  The phone runs on  Android 9.0 Pie . And it is a bit surprising that it runs on the latest software when many high-end phones are yet to receive Android Pie updates. But it is there. How the device performs, we’ll let you know after a full review.  For now, this phone has not even launched anywhere, so, our unit could very well be a demo unit, too. Lenovo officials have cued the price of the phone\xa0to be around $100 and said to hit various market really soon.

['Understanding Pixel Binning in Smartphones featuring Xiaomi Redmi Note 7'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 17, 2019']",2019-01-17 11:56:40+00:00,"['These days, smartphones usually seem to focus on two things – getting that edge-to-edge display and fitting more cameras into the phone. Smartphone cameras have been getting better over the years, with AI this and AI that. But at one time, it will reach its limit. After all, there’s only so much software can do.  At some point, you need to improve the hardware as well. And so, these days, we can see some smartphones with large megapixels in their cameras. Now, that is probably to create a hype in the market, but nevertheless, they are there. But then again, the software also needs to work in tandem with the hardware. And to make effective use of the large megapixels, pixel binning seems to be the way.  While pixel binning is being used by some phones already, this topic is raised recently, because of the new  Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 . The supposed mid-range killer phone packs a  Snapdragon 660 chipset   but features a  48 MP camera\xa0 at the back. But the Snapdragon 660 is not capable of processing that many megapixels from the camera. And so, pixel binning comes into play.        What is Pixel Binning?  Pixel Binning, actually, is pretty simple…it is just combining more pixels into 1 to make it a superpixel. But there is a lot more that goes into it behind the scenes.  And to understand that, we also need to know how camera sensors work. The general notion is that the larger the camera in terms of megapixel count, the better. Sharper pictures have more details even when zoomed in. Then, there are pixels to consider. That, too, differs in terms of camera sensors and digital output on your screen.  On a sensor, there is something called a  Bayer filter . Which means there are red, green and blue filters on top – allowing these lights to pass through. These pixels are laid out in alternate patterns with the green filter occupying 50% and the other two occupying 25% each. So, the pixels are arranged in such a way that each pixel alternates in this way: Red-Green-Blue-Green, and so on. Without the Bayer filter, the images would come out monochrome.  Also Read:  Understanding camera terms  These Red, Green and Blue pixels are combined into a single RGB pixel using a process called  Demosaicing , generating your standard RGB colored picture in the digital format. Now, when the JPG picture is to be generated, pixel binning takes place during this demosaicing.  It takes 4 pixels, i.e. of a 2 x 2 grid and combines them into 1, so, the information gathered by 4 pixels is now contained by a single larger one, which means, the noise in each pixel are compressed while the details get sharper.  But squeezing the pixels also decreases the resolution. And so, a 40 MP camera would produce about 10 MP image. But that, still in itself, is a good usable picture, so, there’s nothing to worry about. However, this technology is not generally used in cameras with smaller megapixels, as it can significantly reduce the resolution of the pictures.  But binning actually has quite a few benefits. It immensely  helps in low light photography , by compressing noise and details to make photos sharper. Each pixel gets its own light, so, when light from 4 pixels are combined into 1, the image should be better. It also helps to get good frame rates in videos by reducing the exposure time and reducing number of pixels to be measured. More benefits include improving the signal to noise ratio and improving High Dynamic Range.  The limitations of using the technology, in addition to it reducing the resolution, is that the camera lacks RAW output. That is you cannot produce RAW images from mobile phones unless the manufacturer lets you do it by disabling pixel binning, like the  Huawei Mate 20 Pro .  But there are also other mathematics and whatnot that goes into image processing. So, this is only a small part of camera technology.  Also Read:  Xiaomi Mobiles price in Nepal  Redmi Note 7’s 48 MP Camera  And about the Redmi Note 7, whose chip cannot support the huge 48 MP camera’s outputs. The  Samsung GM1 sensor  used in it has  Quad-Bayer filter , which means that the pixels are arranged in…let’s say, a quad-alternate way, which leads to the same pixel binning process as discussed. So, that’s how the processor can support a 48 MP camera. The Snapdragon 660 not being able to process a 48 MP image has nothing to do with the 48 MP hardware on it.  All in all, this means despite the claims of large megapixels in smartphone cameras, it is not always necessary that they produce the best of images. Now, we’re not saying the Redmi Note 7 will not produce good results. We just mean to say that, this is not only a marketing gimmick from Xiaomi – it definitely has a 48 MP camera, but at the same time, it will not produce as good photos as a real 48 MP camera!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pixel-binning-explained.jpg']

The Japanese tech giant has already astounded many with the features packed in its cameras. And it does not seem to stop any time soon. Sony recently unveiled the Sony Alpha A6400 mirrorless camera with an impressive list of features and specs. Despite being a mid-range device, the camera features real-time eye autofocus, real-time tracking, and the world’s fastest autofocus. But what more does the camera offers? Let’s find out here.  Sony Alpha a6400 Overview  As the name suggests, the Sony Alpha A6400 is not the direct successor the fan-loved  A6500 . The mirrorless camera is here to replace the popular A6300 with a plentiful of amazing features.  The camera is provided with a latest and powerful Bionz X processor, which is also present in Sony’s top-of-the-line  Alpha A9   and the fan-loved  Alpha A7 III  &  A7R III  devices. So the image processing here will be 1.8x times faster than that on the A6300. That’s not all, Sony also claims to have improved the color accuracy. Not just the image processing, the autofocus on this device is also equally snappy. The Sony Alpha A6400 flaunts an autofocus speed of 0.02 seconds, which is the fastest autofocus in the world in today’s date.         Furthermore, Sony has also introduced Real-Time Eye AF with AI-based subject recognition, which is the first time on any Sony devices. With this new autofocus technology, the A6400 promises to deliver even more accurate and faster autofocusing than the previous generation of its Eye AF system. Moreover, Sony has now increased the versatility of the device with the inclusion of priority mode to set autofocusing on left or on the right eye. For best better autofocusing, Sony has also incorporated 425 PDAF and 425 CDAF point, which makes 84% coverage on the image area.  “In all autofocus modes, the camera now automatically detects the eyes of the subject and activates Eye AF with a half press of the shutter button, and when in AF-C or AF-A mode, the preferred eye (left or right) of your subject can be selected as the focus point,” Sony says. “Choices include Auto / Right Eye / Left Eye, and a Switch Right / Left Eye function is able to be assigned to a custom function as well.”  Talking about the sensor, the camera features a 24MP Sony Exmor Sensor. And like all of the Sony Alpha A6000 series devices, the sensor on the A6400 is also an APS-C one. So you should also consider the crop factor while looking for the camera lenses.      Sony Alpha A6400 Front     Sony Alpha A6400 flip-up touchscreen     Sony Alpha A6400 back   On the display front, the Sony A6400 comes with a 3-inch TFT display. The display here is an articulating one, you can capture selfies as well. The tilting display (180-degrees) here is also expected to lure the videographers and vloggers.  For video, the a6400 can shoot internal UHD 4K with full pixel readout and no pixel binning. The camera collects “about 2.4x the amount of data required for 4K movies, and then oversamples it to produce high-quality 4K footage with exceptional detail and depth,” Sony says. 1080p Full HD can be shot at 120fps and up to 100Mbps.   Despite being a midrange device, the camera is capable of recording 4K movies as well. However, the 4K videos can be recorded only on 30fps. But on scaling the resolution down to Full-HD, users can record videos up to 120fps. So you can capture Full-HD slo-mo videos on 4x @ 30fps and 5x @ 24fps as well.

Having a good camera smartphone is a matter of pride these days. Our life has been dependent\xa0 so much \xa0on cameras\xa0 these days. Taking photos instead of scanning printed documents, translating documents, taking photos in order to report suspicious person or activity, to compare price in the market or confirming the item of your search, the list goes on. Also taking photos and posting in the social media is still trending. Having a good camera smartphone helps us do such things with ease. With a view to saving your time, we have narrowed down a list of best budget camera smartphones in Nepal. 1 Xiaomi Redmi S2        The  Redmi S2 has recently received a price drop in Nepal \xa0and at the new price, the smartphone is an absolute bargain if you are looking for a good budget camera smartphone.  When it comes to the megapixel count, the setup looks similar to that on the Redmi Note 5 AI with 12MP main camera backed by 5MP depth sensor. However, the hardware setup is different. The aperture here is slightly narrower at f/2.2 and the pixel size is slightly smaller (1.25μm). Nonetheless, the images captured from the phone looks amazingly great. And since there is a capable Snapdragon 625 chipset on the board, the image processing is also snappy here. The camera on the smartphone is also EIS-enabled. So the videos recorded from\xa0the phone remain free from shakes and vibration. So you can perform handheld video shootings as well. On the selfie front, the smartphone truly shines. The Redmi S2 comes with an AI-powered 16MP front snapper. The selfie shooter captures some awe-inspiring images with an appreciable sharpness. And since the selfie shooter is Artificially Intelligent, removing the facial blemishes and acne on the real-time is also possible.   Buy Xiaomi Redmi S2 here 2 Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI When it comes to the budget camera smartphones, the  Redmi Note 5 AI  is one of the capable performers, which doesn’t put a hole in your pocket (I am talking about the 3/32GB variant here).  The smartphone boasts a dual camera setup at the back accompanied by Dual-LED flash. The primary camera features a 12MP sensor, which is relatively large with 1/2.55 inch of size. The pixel size of 1.4µm is equally impressive here as a larger pixel summons a substantial amount of light and the captured images also pack abundant details.\xa0The second camera here possesses a typical depth sensor, which garners depth information of the subject while capturing the portrait images. And with both cameras in action, the smartphone is capable of taking some amazing portrait images.   When it comes to the videos, the smartphone truly shines. The smartphone features EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) due to which the captured images remain free from shakes and vibration which is usually the case while capturing videos with a free hand.  Taking about the selfie camera, there’s a 13MP camera. The front snapper is not just rich in megapixel counts but also gathers abundant facial details into the images. And despite the absence of dual selfie camera, the handset is capable of capturing portrait selfies as well. 3 Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo The J7 series of smartphones is one of the most popular series in Samsung’s lineup. And on 2018, Samsung crowned its popular smartphone series with a fancy dual camera setup at the back. And with this setup, the smartphone looks really compelling, especially in the camera front.  Going by the specs, the  Galaxy J7 Duo  embraces a camera duo at the back. The camera pair is a combination of 13MP and 5MP sensors, both of them are fitted with a lens of f/1.9 aperture. So with a large aperture on the board, the lens allows greater amount of light to strike into the sensor. So the captured images look\xa0really bright and lively.   And with the twin camera on the board, the rear camera is capable of capturing portrait images as well. Despite the presence of dual camera, even the selfie shooter here captures some astounding portrait images. As far as selfie shooter is concerned, the 8MP snapper on the front gets the job done. The front shooter is also accompanied by an LED flash. So even in the low light settings, the Galaxy J7 Duo gets you all covered. 4 Sony Xperia X        The Sony Xperia X was priced at Rs. 32,500 when it was launched. Now the handset is on the shelf of Daraz at 43% discounted rate. And hence, the smartphone made it to our list of best budget camera smartphones. Going by the specs, the smartphone comes with a 23MP shooter on the back. When all the smartphones on our list are boasting a dual camera setup at the back, the  Sony Xperia X  lacks that feature. Despite the absence of the secondary rear camera, the handset captures amazing images. And with the 23MP camera on the board, you’ll get high-res images, which are abundantly rich when it comes to the details.  Talking about the selfie camera, there is a 13MP selfie shooter with a wide f/2.0\xa0 aperture. The sensor is also large in size with a sensor size of 1/3″, so the captured images will look really sharp with substantial facial details.   Buy Sony Xperia X here 5 Lava R5        Lava smartphones may not be that well known in the Nepali market. But when it comes to the cameras, they have always strived to offer more. And  Lava R5  is one of such smartphones, which promises to cater more in the camera department. When it comes to the rear cameras, the Lava R5 is another smartphone on our list with two cameras at the back. The camera pair consists of a 13MP primary sensor coupled with a 5MP secondary or the depth sensor. With both cameras triggered, the Lava R5 captures some captivating portrait images.  On inspecting the front side of the phone, you will be greeted with a 13MP selfie shooter. Unlike most of the budget camera smartphones out there, the Lava R5 embraces the sensor with a large pixel size of 2.0μm. So with the large pixel size, the pixel garners plentiful of light. Also, the captured selfies pack lavish amount of facial details. Furthermore, the handset is capable of capturing portrait\xa0selfies as well.

With the whole industry moving towards AI, this seems evident.  5G connectivity  Samsung also says the faster LPDDR5 memory will help with 5G connectivity. We already know one of the three devices from the S10 lineup will feature 5G connectivity, which should benefit\xa0from this new technology (LPDDR5). While the Snapdragon 855 chip will need another modem to support 5G, the LPDDR5 RAM should help in reducing the latency between the chip and the modem and other technical things that go inside smartphones. Off-topic: A few rumors suggest the new 5G Samsung phone will stay exclusive to Verizon network for the first few months.  Conclusion  So, to conclude, the LPDDR5 chips are faster, consumes less power and helps with AI-powered\xa0applications & 5G enabled smartphones. Should the new memory standards make its way to your next Samsung flagship, be sure to check for these improvements and get back to us.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LPDDR5.jpg']

The latest addition is the  Huawei Watch GT , which has already launched and available in purchase in other parts of the world. And now, the Huawei Watch GT has made its way to Nepal.  The Huawei Watch GT is a more fitness-focused watch rather than your full-fledged smartwatch like the  Samsung Galaxy Watch . But it also lets you do quite a lot of things as well. There are two models to choose from – a Huawei Watch GT  Classic  and a  Sports  version. But the Classic variant is very hard to come across. So, just like in the international markets, the one coming to Nepal might be the Sports version.         The watch is pretty big, measuring  46.5 mm  and there’s only that one option available. But it also has a big  1.39″ AMOLED screen , which is pretty bright and visible around daylights. And packs a  resolution of 454 x 454  pixels that should be more than adequate for a smartwatch. There are two buttons on the side for navigation, but you’ll have to interact with the touchscreen for the most part.  Inside, you have a  16 MB RAM  and  128 MB storage . Which clarifies the fact that you can’t do a lot of things on it, like on Galaxy Watches. It is mostly fitness centered with its central app being called Workouts which includes varieties of workouts like Running, Walking, Swimming, Climbing and stuff – with both indoors and outdoors options. But alongside it, there are your regular smartwatch functions like compass, alarm, flashlight, phone finder, etc.  In addition, this time, Huawei went with their own software,  Light OS  for this smartwatch. And the OS gives you only limited options. There are no 3rd party app support or Play Store apps like on the ones with Google’s Wear OS. However, the most impressive thing about this watch is its battery life. It packs a  large 420 mAh  battery, and Huawei claims it lasts close to a month on a single charge. Considering it doesn’t do much, it is believable too.  Huawei Watch GT Price in Nepal  This watch  costs about $230 internationally , but there are a lot of discounted prices going around. And in Nepal too, the price has been set very competitively at  Rs. 19,990.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Huawei-watch-GT-price-nepal-official.jpg']
['Deal Alert: Xiaomi Redmi S2 on the shelf of SastoDeal now at a compelling price'],"['Deals', 'Sastodeal', 'Xiaomi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['January 14, 2019']",2019-01-14 12:24:36+00:00,"['Under the price of Rs. 25,000 , we have never forgotten to include  Xiaomi Redmi S2  on our list. The smartphone is one of the best value-for-money devices for the price. Now the device is on the shelf on SastoDeal at a price cheaper than what we usually see on the market. And for the new price, the device looks absolutely compelling.  Xiaomi Redmi S2 Overview  The major highlight of the phone is its cameras. The Redmi S2 features a dual camera setup at the back, which incorporates 12MP and 5MP sensors. The secondary one here is a depth sensor, which garners depth information while capturing the portrait images. And since there is a dedicated camera for the depth info, you will get amazing portrait images with natural-like blurs on the background. The smartphone is also equally intriguing when it comes to the videos. It can capture Full-HD videos at 30fps at max. But the best part here is the presence of  Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) , which is a rare feature for its price. The EIS on the device suppresses shakes and vibrations in the videos so that the movies recorded from the device looks quite stable.         Even on the selfie front, you will get a decent shooter out there. The 16MP snapper on the front does really a good job. There is also a dedicated LED flash on the front. So even in the low light settings, you don’t have to worry about taking selfies.  Talking about the performance, the handset comes with a capable Snapdragon 625 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM. On the storage side of things, you will get 64GB of onboard storage with a dedicated SD card slot to expand things further. There is a 3GB/32GB variant available in the market. But since there is no any sort of offer on it, I would like to skip it here.  With the SD625 & 4GB RAM combo, all the lights apps and games run at an absolute fluidity. Even while playing some high-end games, you will only notice minor lags and stutter. So considering the price,  Redmi S2  is surely one of the best performers out there. And if you are a gamer, the smartphone won’t disappoint.  Talking about the display, the handset embraces a tall 6-inch display in an 18:9 aspect ratio. And good things here is, there is no any sort of notch or cutouts on the display. So the display on this device looks all clean and appealing. The display on the handset features HD+ resolution, which is a usual case for a typical budget-oriented smartphone.   Xiaomi has also been generous on providing the necessary sensors on the device. The Redmi S2 comes with all the primary sensors like fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, and compass. And when it comes to the battery, a 3080mAh non-removable battery keeps the device running. Since there is an efficient processor and an HD display, which consumes less power, the battery on the devices promises a prolonged backup.

From speakers to wireless table lamps, Xiaomi does it all. And so, along with the launch of the  Redmi Note 7 , Xiaomi also launched their new photo printer.   In the present world where photo albums exist in our phones only, we may not see the use for such photo printers. And even if you do want photos, photo printers are quite expensive. And of course, Xiaomi, being Xiaomi, had to launch a photo printer that is quite affordable for people to actually want to buy one.        Dubbed as the  Xiaomi MIJIA Photo Printer , it costs  CNY 500  or  $73 . Plus, the photo printer comes with a bundle of 40 photo paper and a ribbon which  costs extra $8 . For the price, what you are getting is a pretty sweet deal. The MIJIA Photo Printer can print out your photos in various formats, and in great quality.   The printer which is compact enough to fit on your hands can print photos up to a maximum size of 6 inches. The resolution of the printer is  300 x 300 DPI (Dots Per Inch)  and uses  CMY-3 Color Sublimation printing technology . This means that it can give you a complete  256-level color scale presentation . In addition, sublimation technology is capable of giving you richer colors and wider color gamut coverage leading to better color reproduction in photos.  Also, the printer automatically coats the printed photos with a transparent protective film which gives it scratch and fingerprint resistance as well. The device comes with a MIJIA app support and WeChat app support but also supports computer wireless printing. And the device is fairly minimalistic, with the power button doubling as the print button as well.  For now, there is no word on when it will be available, both in China or in other markets.

Not only we saw some great and innovative smartphones, but we also saw non-Apple phones crossing the\xa0 $1000 barrier easily, like the  Samsung Galaxy Note 9  and the  Huawei Mate 20 Pro . But of course, not everyone wants to shell out the big bucks for smartphones or get the latest flagships. And so, Alcatel revealed two entry-level phones at CES 2019: Alcatel 1X and the Alcatel 1C.  Yes, Alcatel is among the underdogs of the smartphones. They only make entry level or budget phones, and even those are not in as much hype as ones like Huawei, Xiaomi or ZTE. But for those looking for a basic smartphone, these provide great value.  Alcatel 1X Overview  The Alcatel 1X is the better of the two smartphones. It is slimmer, has thin bezels around the screen and the 18:9 aspect ratio, which everyone seems to be after these days. With an anti-slip plastic back, the phone doesn’t have a smooth touch and feel. It is not really a good looking phone, but then again, this costs only $120!         And for that price, it features a 5.5″ display with HD resolution. It features dual cameras: a 13 MP primary sensor with a 2 MP depth sensor. For a budget phone to provide this is also something commendable. The front camera is a 5 MP shooter, and the phone is powered by a 1.5 GHz Quad-core MediaTek processor. It has 16 GB of onboard storage but is expandable up to 128 GB via microSD. The phone packs a 3000 mAh battery and runs on Android 8.1 Oreo.

It is comparatively thicker and heavier and has wide bezels as well. Also, it only packs a single camera at the back, which is kind of against today’s trends. Also, with a poor resolution of not even an HD, this is the strict definition of an entry-level phone.   It has a plastic back as well but has a criss-cross design for a fresh look. It has a 480p resolution, a single 5 MP camera at the back and a 2 MP front camera. This phone is powered by a 1.3 GHz Spreadtrum processor and has 1 GB RAM. Storage wise, it has 8 GB internal memory which is expandable up to 32 GB via microSD. The device has only 2000 mAh battery. But for all this, this phone costs only $70.

And when it comes to all-rounders, it is not wrong to say that only very few laptops provide you a great package such as the Dell XPS 15. The Dell XPS 15 packs up to 4K screens, greatest performance, good graphics, and sleek premium build all in one. And that is enough to take this series to a class of their own.  With 2019 beginning, the company is set to improve the  Dell XPS 15 9570  lineups too. And for that, the series is getting a better screen. We might soon see New Dell XPS 15 coming with  4K OLED panel in March  this year.         Although the Dell XPS 15 has 4K screens already, they’re IPS LCD panels. And while they have great color accuracy throughout, OLED panels will make it better. The new Dell XPS 15 OLED panels will  offer HDR ,  100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage  and  100,000:1 contrast ratio . For the record, DCI-P3 is a relatively newer standard of measuring color accuracy, and it is considered better than the NTSC Color Gamut Coverage. And there are very few displays that are capable of portraying the entire DCI-P3 color gamut.  This means that with such features, the Dell XPS 15 will become a better machine for digital content creators than it already is! In addition, with the OLED display, you get deeper blacks and better colors as well. Also, the inclusion of OLED panels can make the laptops slimmer, maybe by not much, but still… The new laptop coming soon could be the reason Dell is not really working to fix the BIOS issues of the current Dell XPS 9570.  Anyways, the new Dell XPS 15 with OLED panels will be coming out in March. There is no word on how they will deal with the higher power required by OLED panels on the laptops. Also, other configurations about the laptop are still in veil but we can expect similar configurations we have presently. What we only know so far, is that it is coming…soon.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dell-xps-15-9570-review.jpg']

With the Dell G5, the company provides you with a gaming laptop that just works, without any fancy additions to it. It has everything you need in a gaming laptop but falls short in some aspects. But then again, there’s not much to complain about. You won’t love it; you won’t hate it…you’ll find everything just okay.   Dell G5 5587 Specifications:   Design : Plastic body + Metal chassis on the inside, (38.9 x 27.47 x\xa02.5) cm  Display :\xa015.6″ Full-HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Anti-Glare IPS Display with 219 nits max brightness,\xa058% standard RGB, 44% NTSC Color Gamut,\xa046% Adobe RGB  Keyboard:  Full-size chiclet\xa0keyboard, Red backlighting (optional), 1.4 mm key travel  Processor: \xa0Hexa-core 8 th \xa0gen i7-8750H processor, Base-Clock @ 2.2 GHz, Turbo Boost Clock up to 4.1 GHz (Also available in i5-8300H)  RAM: \xa0DDR4 8 GB (2x slots, upgradeable up to 32 GB)  Graphics: \xa04 GB GDDR5 NVidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti  Battery: \xa04-cell 56 Watt-hours (up to 4.5 hours of backup)  Adapter:\xa0 130 Watts  Storage: \xa0128 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD + 1 TB HDD  Webcam:\xa0 720p Webcam  Connectivity: \xa0802.11 ac Gigabit Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v5.0  Ports:\xa0 3 x\xa0USB A 3.1, 1 x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3 support), 1 x 3.5 mm headphone jack, 1 x HDMI, 1 x RJ-45 Ethernet,\xa01 x 2-in-1 SDcard slot  Price: \xa0Rs.133000 ($950 international)    Buy Dell G5 here  Design         Right of the bat, the design of the laptop screams “gaming”, with its  muscular looks  and that  red accent  all around. That is pretty old school, and on first glance, you might not be able to tell the difference between Dell G5 and or a  Dell Inspiron 7577 . Some might find this design boring, but it looks okay to me. There are two color options available, the black one, and this red one. This one looks a bit too flashy and intrusive. But that is all about personal preference.   The laptop has pointed but slightly curved edges, which gives it a bit of a different character. The back houses large air vents while the front has the same gilled design, and when closed, it resembles a sports car, just like the  Dell G7 .   The build is very impressive. The chassis is metal, but the lid and back plate is plastic. It appears very sturdy overall, and there is no flex whatsoever on the keyboard deck when pressed. The hinge at the middle is sturdy but flexible enough to allow you to open the laptop with a single hand as well. And to me, that’s a big deal. The only inconvenience is that the top lid gets smudged very quickly, and is difficult to get rid of.  Overall, the design is that of a typical gaming laptop.  Display  Again, the display in this one is just okay.\xa0 First off, the thickness of the bezels surrounding the  15.6” screen  seems ridiculous. It feels like the bezels are there to compensate for the large form factor of the laptop. They just seem redundant, and it feels as if the designers at Dell threw it in just because they could!   The screen is a  Full HD panel  and  60 Hz display , with very average quality. Viewing angles are also okay, but you will notice slight shifts at extreme angles. The display, overall, appears dull, because…well, it has low everything. A  low brightness of 219 nits  maximum, low  58% standard RGB , low  44% NTSC Color Gamut Coverage  and low  46% Adobe RGB .  So, needless to say, this laptop is  NOT for content creators! \xa0But of course, you won’t have any problems with gaming. I guess the Dell G-series is designed to be this way. The G7 was this way, and the G5 is the same – actually worse. This feels very gamer-centric. Because with such display quality, even multi-media is just going to be pretty average.  The display is not as bad as on some budget gaming laptops, but this is not like a good display by any standards either. So, yes, the display is average as well.  Keyboard and Trackpad   The keyboard is good, too. It is a well-built keyboard, feels robust and the keys are well stacked. There’s  1.4 mm key travel , which is good enough. The key presses are responsive, with clicky feedback, which is great. The only problem is the small arrow keys.  There is  red backlighting on the keyboard , and that is as intrusive as overdone. The red can be very overwhelming on the eyes, and even with the backlighting off, the red lettering makes it a bit difficult to see in the dark than white lettering.   As for the trackpad, the size is nice, and with  Windows Precision Drivers , the tracking was fine. Gestures work every time, too, and this is If you’re coming from a  Dell 7567 , you’ll feel right at home.  Performance  The Dell G5 comes in two different configurations – one with an  8 th -gen quad-core Intel i5-8300H  and another one with the  8 th -gen Hexa-core Intel i7-8750H . Our unit is the latter with  6 cores and 12 threads . And of course, this is a pretty fast processor. You might know about this processor quite a bit, so, I guess, there’s not much to say in this regard. Just for the record, this is a great processor.   However, this laptop has  8 GB of RAM  at  2666 MHz , which is very basic for a gaming laptop. Now, the problem is not the size of the RAM as much as the configuration of it. You have  two RAM slots , and so, you get  two sticks of 4 GB RAMs , in it. So, if you want to upgrade, you have to replace both RAM sticks to get the sweet 16 GB. And that’s very inconvenient.  As for graphics, too, you get two configurations as well –\xa0 a  GTX 1050 Ti  with 4 GB VRAM or a  GTX 1060 Max-Q . Now, those are both very middle of the line for gaming. And at this price point, this is a usual dilemma for buyers – you have to choose between a better GPU or a better CPU. And our unit came with a GTX 1050 Ti. So, the gaming experience is also pretty average.   FIFA 19 , which is not a very graphic intensive game, averaged on 80 fps on ultra-settings, but there were some choppiness and stutters. Similarly,  CS: GO  gave us about 80 fps easily with slight stutters. \xa0  DOTA 2 \xa0crossed 100 fps at max settings, which is nice. As for  PUBG , the game ran at about 50 fps with slight lags and stutters at default settings. You have to keep the settings at the lowest if you want more frames. And you don’t wanna know, how it does at maximum settings. Games like Dota 2 and Paladins are not as fun to play, in the 60 Hz screen. The gaming performance is okay, its just the screen can sometimes freeze for like a second as it cannot keep up with the fast-paced games.  So, this thing can run almost all kinds of games, but you’ll have to trade between good frame rates or smooth performance. So, again, another average score in performance.  Thermals  As for thermals, the large air vents do their job. The laptop never heats up to the point to make it uncomfortable to use – even while gaming. There is very less thermal throttling, even after an hour of gaming. You might notice around 10% of the drop in frame rates after that amount of time, but nothing that will hamper your experience.  Storage and Battery  As for storage, you get an  NVMe M.2 128 GB SSD , and a  1 TB HDD . The SSD space is quite small, but that is why the HDD is there to compensate for that very fact. But the SSD speeds reached only over  500 MBPS for reading  and only about  150 MBPS for write , which is really slow.  For the battery, you have a  56 Watt-hour battery , which is very gaming like, I guess. But the battery lasts an impressive  4 and half hours on light or regular usages  like editing documents and streaming videos. And that is pretty good for a gaming laptop. While gaming, however, it lasts some 1 and a half hours, but you wouldn’t want to do that, because gaming on the battery will give you a sluggish performance.  Ports and Webcam  There are enough ports on this laptop as well. On the left, you have a  charging port , an  Ethernet port , a  USB A  and an  SDcard slot . On the right, you get an  HDMI , a  USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 ,  two USB As  and a  3.5 mm headphone jack .      Dell G5 Ports   1  of 2                                      The webcam is just like 90% of the other laptops out there.\xa0 It is grainy, blurry, and not very good. But nobody complains about the camera on laptops anyway, so, no point talking about it.  The speakers of this laptop are also only decent, as there is no bass. But it can only do so much without a sub-woofer in it.  Conclusion  In conclusion, the Dell G5 is a pretty average laptop, with the word “average” being the key here! But if you look at all the aspects of the laptop, you will see for yourself.  The design is just like any other gaming laptop – it screams gaming. A large muscular body with a red accent which is not shy about its appearance. The display is the same, too. The performance is what you get for the money – it is powerful for normal usage, but very average for gaming, with the middle of the line graphics and a standard 60 Hz display.  For a  price of $950  or  Rs.133,000  here in Nepal, this is actually pretty solid. It is functional and will not disappoint gamers. And at this price, there are very few competitors of this one. At least, not any which we’ve reviewed until now.  But in the same price category, there is the Dell G7 as well – which is basically the same laptop, with very slight changes in design. The G7 belongs to Dell’s 7000 series whereas the G5 falls to the 5000 series. I don’t know if that makes any difference to you, I’m just putting it out there. Also, the G5 is slightly cheaper than the G7.  You get similar specs in the  MSI GL63 8RD  with a slightly better display, and also in the  ASUS FX504 . But we haven’t tested them, so can’t vouch for them. What we can vouch for, however, is that the Dell G5 is a good gaming laptop for the price. Of course, I wouldn’t recommend it to any content creators. This is just for gamers, who are looking for a good unit under Rs. 150,000.  Pros:   Good design and sturdy build  Good overall performance  Value for money  Good battery life   Cons:   Poor display  No RGB lighting  Average gaming performance  Heavy weight  Dual RAM slots making upgrading a hassle']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dell-g5-review.jpg']

['The Best Tech of CES 2019'],['CES 2019'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 12, 2019']",2019-01-12 02:32:55+00:00,"['The annual Consumer Electronics Show came and went. And there was an overwhelming amount of tech that showed up. From Vegan Beef Burgers to full-fledged self-driving trucks, CES 2019 had it all. Many of the exhibited technology were just concepts that would materialize in some months or years, while many will be available commercially. And so, we round up the best pieces of technology seen at CES 2019. Of course, most of them depend on preferences, but, here is The Best Tech of CES 2019.  1) Best Gaming Laptop: Dell Alienware Area 51M  Of course, the most relevant tech to us would be laptops and smartphones. While there were not many smartphones at CES 2019, laptops made their presence known. And out of all there were, the  Dell Alienware Area 51M  takes the cake. While it does pack the most powerful of specs, it takes the first position because of its modular design and build.         Out of the many configurations available, the top of the line can pack up to  8-core Intel i7-9900K  and  RTX 2080  graphics with  64 GB RAM ! You can easily swap out the CPU, GPU, RAM and Hard Drive according to gaming preference. Also, this means that you can upgrade it with the latest tech in the coming years and your machine won’t be obsolete anytime soon.  In addition, this is not as expensive as some other laptops at CES. With a  starting price of $2549,  this laptop actually makes a pretty good case for itself. And so, it rests at the top of the Best Tech of CES 2019.  2) Best Gaming PC: Mek Mini  Gaming PCs are always this big-ass machines that take a lot of space and are not portable. Which is why people are attracted to gaming laptops. But the  Mek Mini  is a new tiny gaming PC that might appeal to you. This computer measures some 10 x 10 x 5 inches and  weighs about 3 kgs .   While it might be smaller than a 12-pack beer, it is not short of power. The Mek Mini is configured with the  hexa-core i7-8700 ,  RTX 2070 graphics  and  16 GB of RAM . Plus, you get  240 GB M.2 SSD  and  2 TB of SATA HDD . There’s also  Killer AC Wi-Fi  with  Dual Gigabit Ethernet  and  Bluetooth 5.  There are also all kinds of ports that comes with regular sized computers. And even though the computer is small, it has  270-degree ventilation  to keep cool.  The computer is pretty small, so it won’t occupy much space on your table. But since it weighs only 3 kg, you can carry it if you have access to other peripherals of a computer. So, think of it as a portable PC. At  $1500 , this seems like quite a sweet deal too.  3) Best Display: HP Omen X Emperium 65   Now  HP Omen X Emperium\xa065  is technically a gaming monitor but with Android TV and Chromecast support. So, it can act as a 4K TV for you, if you’re not gaming on it. But this  65″ 4K display  is a BFGD (Big Format Gaming Display), so, you’re supposed to game on it for the most part. This 65″ 4K screen has a  95% DCI-P3 color accuracy ,  144 Hz refresh rate , and NVidia’s G-Sync. Also, this features a  full-sized DisplayPort  port which allows you get high frame rates even in 4K.  In addition, you’re getting a peak  brightness of 1000 nits , HDR 10 support and a built-in  soundbar with 3 stereo amps at 120 watts . The features are definitely weighty, and so, the price is as scary as the name itself. At  $5000 , this gaming monitor might certainly be the best display, but not for everyone.  4) Best Smartwatch: Matrix PowerWatch 2  In a plethora of smartwatches, there are only a few that stand out. Right now, it is the  Apple Watch Series 4  and  Samsung Galaxy Watch  that take the spotlight. And for smartwatches, having to charge them every day or every 2 days can be quite a hassle. And to address this very problem, CES showcased the  Matrix PowerWatch 2  – a smartwatch that draws power from your body heat!   It is built on Matrix’s proprietary  thermo-electric technology , and it also features power harvesting via solar power. Also, it is  water resistant up to 200 meters . The watch comes with an intelligent built-in  heart rate monitoring capabilities  and  built-in GPS . It is capable of conducting a highly accurate measurement of calorie-count, as well as pace, distance, steps, sleep, cadence and more. In addition, the watch also integrates with third-party apps such as Apple HealthKit and Google Fit  The watch is priced at  $200 for pre-bookers  while it will be priced at $500 after it hits retail.  5) Best Smart Home: Lenovo Smart Alarm Clock  We’ve seen some crazy alarms over the years. From floor-mat alarms that only turn off when you step on them to alarms that run away and hide, there are a lot. This Smart Alarm clock from Lenovo is nothing crazy of that sort. This is a relatively simple device – an alarm clock with a smart display. It is your alarm in the morning and also a reminder of your daily schedules. Plus, you get Google Assistant in it.   The  4.4″ display  won’t do much, except show you the time and your schedule. It also syncs with your calendar to provide suggestions on your alarm. There is an  ambient light sensor , which dims the display when you’re preparing to sleep, so that it will be easy on the eyes. In addition, when the time gets closer to your alarm, the display gets brighter – which, the company claims will help you wake up with light.  Additionally, you can also listen to music or podcast on your Smart alarm and control other smart home devices. This is not a very comprehensive alarm but at  $80 , this is good enough.  6) Best Health Tech: Quell 2.0 Pain Relief   If you’re familiar with the term “chronic pain”, then you know it comes with its own set of inconveniences, not to mention the constant pain they’re in. Many people suffer from such back pain, joint aches, and the likes. And they only have painkillers to rely on, which, many of the times, have various side-effects. So, this is a pain relief device that gives you  mild shocks to disrupt your pain signals .  This small device is a wearable, which you wear on your leg. It is controlled via an app, with lot of personalization options to help you manage your pain effectively. You can control the level of shock it provides and there are also many more therapy options. For  $300 , this device is a good and healthy option for those who suffer from chronic pain.  7) Best TV: LG Signature OLED TV R  There are  8K televisions  out there now, but to me, they don’t sound like a big deal. Yes, you get four times more pixel count as you get on 4K TVs, but unless the screens are like really huge, you won’t be able to tell the difference. Also, there is no 8K content available out there and even if it up-scales content, there is not much use for it for now. And there are more interesting things out there.   The  LG Signature OLED TV R  is a large  65″ 4K television , but the most exciting feature about it is that it is rollable. Meaning, you can roll it down into its  100-Watt soundbar  when not in use, and it won’t always hog your wall space or your window view constantly. The OLED screen is made out of a flexible substrate, and promises up to  50,000 roll cycles , so, there’s not much to worry about.  In addition, if you’re only listening to music on the smart TV, you can keep it rolled into the sound bar too. Another interesting trick is that it has something called  L ine View  which only keeps the top quarter of the TV rolled out which displays the time and weather and stuff. There are also various “mood” settings that give off visualizations like snowfall or fireplace to suit your mood.  While this is very interesting and to some extent groundbreaking, this is going to be very expensive. So, even it this takes the spot of best TV, it is for you to admire from afar.  So, that is all for the Best Tech of CES 2019. Even though these won’t make it to Nepal, what do you think of it? Did we miss any of your favorites? Do let us know in the comments.

['Smartphone camera lenses: What are the types & how do they work?'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['January 11, 2019']",2019-01-11 12:31:49+00:00,"['In 2017, we saw the bandwagon of dual lens setup in the smartphones, which encroached even the mid-range and budget smartphone. And in 2018, the feature grew even more mainstream. However, to stay ahead in the camera game, some smartphone brands pushed their limit little further. So we were able to see multiple lenses setup in various handsets.  Among all the smartphones launched in 2018,  Huawei P20 Pro  and  Mate 20 Pro  with triple rear cameras and  Samsung Galaxy A9 2018 \xa0with quad rear cameras are the notable ones. And I got lucky to use all of the aforementioned smartphones. Among all of the devices mentioned, the Mate 20 Pro impressed me the most. In this article, I will be discussing various types of smartphone cameras lenses, how does each of the lens work, and the scenarios where they can\xa0be used. And since the Mate 20 Pro is one of the most capable shooters out there with the utmost versatility, I will take the image samples from the device to clarify my point. Now, let’s get started.  Wide angle lens  As the name implies, this type of lenses offers a wider field of view and these types of lenses see and capture images in a similar proportion to the human eye.\xa0The focal length for these types of lenses varies from 24mm – 35mm. And lower the number, the wider the field of view it offers.        This is the most prevalent type of lens when it comes to smartphones. Even, the smartphones with single camera setup make use of this type of lens. It is the most versatile type of lens and can be used to capture images in the composition with interiors, landscapes, architecture, and even in forest photography.  Ultra wide angle  Ultra-wide angle lenses stretch the field of view further. Increasing the field of view, these types of lenses allow photographers to accommodate more details of the subject in focus, which cannot be obtained through the normal or standard wide-angle lens.  The focal length for these types of lenses lies in the range of 8mm – 24mm. And just like the normal wide-angle lens, the field of view increases with a decrease in focal length. However, as the field of view increases, the captured images look distorted on the edges. Such type of images with distortion on the edges is known as a fish-eye effect or barrel distortion.  But by maintaining an optimum field of view, the photographers can obtain some intriguing panoramic shots, cityscapes, landscape, real estate, and abstract images.      Huawei Mate 20 pro Normal vs Wide angle samples   1  of 4               Normal         Ultra wide-angle         Normal         Ultra Wide-angle                        The camera samples presented above were taken from the Mate 20 Pro. You can see that the device has stretched the field of view elegantly without any sort of distortion or noise in the images. While I reviewed the Galaxy A9 2018, the ultra-wide-angle shots had barrel distortion. Since there is no noticeable fisheye effect, I would like to call it the job well done.  Telephoto lens  Smartphones have the feature to zoom into the subject in focus. However, such zoomed images lose details. Such images lack sharpness and they look pixelated when printed in a paper.  Sometimes small creatures, some fancy artifacts or wild animals far away fascinate us and we get intrigued to capture them. In many cases, we may not be able to get closer to them to capture them vividly. And digital zooming doesn’t help in these scenarios. So these days, different brands are including an additional lens that helps in optical zooming with which the photographer can capture distant object in a way they are closer to him/her.  With the telephoto lens, users can capture images by zooming into the subject but without losing the details up to a fixed range. Samsung Galaxy Note 9 can perform lossless zooming up to 2x whereas the Mate 20 Pro can perform the similar action up to 3x. Zooming beyond that range, the camera performs digital zooming and the captured images start to lose details.  Optical Zoom vs Digital Zoom  In the case of DSLRs and digital cameras, the lens protrudes ahead increasing the focal length while zooming into the subject. And as discussed earlier, increasing the focal length decreases the field of view. When the field of view decreases, the subject looks zoomed in. However, smartphones don’t have such types of movable lens. So an additional lens is provided just for zooming in into the subject. And in such smartphones, when the user zooms into the subject, the lens with higher focal length comes into action and captures telephoto images. Telephoto lenses have a focal length of 50mm – 200mm.  Digital zoom,\xa0on the other hand, is not the game of the optics. When you digitally zoom into the subject, the smartphone crops only the portion you selected, enlarge it and fits into the same size of the original image. In this case, the captured images are packed with the magnified pixels. But since the pixel size of the camera lenses remains constant, the snapped photos lack sharpness (details) and looks pixelated.      Huawei Mate 20 Pro Normal Vs Telephoto Zoom   1  of 4               Normal Shot         Telephoto Zoom         Normal Shot         Telephoto Zoom                        The camera samples presented here is captured from the Mate 20 Pro. And as you can see, the zoomed in samples looks equally impressive as they pack a substantial amount of details. And since the subjects are zoomed in (telephoto zoom) up to 3x in the images,\xa0I didn’t have to go closer to the subject while composing the shots. The device also promises to capture up to 5x (from 3x to 5x there will be digital zooming) without any sort of loss in the image quality. Since the prime flagship smartphones like  Samsung Galaxy Note 9  and  iPhone XS Max  can capture images with lossless zooming up to 2x, the capability of the Mate 20 Pro here is absolutely awe-inspiring.  Low light  When it comes to the low light scenarios, even some of the major players in the camera game have a bad reputation here. To improve their low light performance, some of the smartphones come with the sensor with a higher megapixel count, which performs pixel binning to get better images. For example, Xiaomi MI A2 with its 20MP secondary sensor performs 4-in-1 pixel binning for better low light images. Some of the smartphone cameras also take a number of images in the quick instant and merges all of them to provide great quality images.  Looking at the recent trend, some handsets tend decreases the shutter speed and capture long exposure shots for better images. Night mode feature on the Mate 20 Pro, Night sight feature on the Google Pixel 3/3XL, and Night Scape feature on the OnePlus 6/6T are the quick examples here. These features usually capture images keeping the shutter speed to 3-6s. And although these features may have the potential to produce some amazing images, a little shake of hand while capturing the images can ruin everything. In such cases, having a low light lens can come in handy.  Low light lenses can be basically understood as the lenses with a wider aperture. A lens with a wide aperture lets in more amount of light into the sensor so the images captured from such lenses looks bright. Also, such images lack noises and grains, which adds elegance to the images. Moreover, in the cameras with a wider aperture, software doesn’t have to make a move to increase the exposure, the quality of images from such smartphones tend to be consistent and the images also look natural at the same time.      Huawei-mate-20-pro-night-time-camera-samples   1  of 7                                                                                        The images showcased here are taken from the Mate 20 Pro in an extremely low light setting. The images here don’t contain any sort of noises and grains. So the capability of the Mate 20 Pro is equally impressive on low light scenarios as well.  And to perform well in the low light settings, the primary shooter here boasts a wide f/1.8 aperture to let in more light even on the dark surroundings. Furthermore, there is a Night mode, which decreases shutter speed to 6 seconds to capture images in extremely low light scenarios. And since there is AIS (Artificial Image Stabilization) to suppress the shakes and vibration while composing the shot, the captured images look stable and blur-free.  Moreover, the Mate 20 Pro flaunts a 40MP sensor, which has the sensor size of 1/1.7″. Since a larger sensor aids to a larger pixel size, the pixel tends to look sharp in such cases. The handset is also capable of performing 4-in-1 pixel binning, where four pixels merge into one. The resolution here reduces to 10MP nonetheless, the captured images look absolutely sharp. So with this setup, the smartphone is capable of capturing sharp and vivid pictures both in the ample light and low light settings.

['Samsung Galaxy S10: Launch date and More rumors'],['Samsung'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 11, 2019']",2019-01-11 05:22:43+00:00,"['Samsung Galaxy S10  is the hot new flagship set to launch on February\xa020. So, there have been so many rumors already about the phone. And not only that, but there have been photos of the cases, protective films, and even the phone itself that gives us a very clear idea. And now, we have some more rumors regarding the phone.  The latest leaks are inclined towards the Galaxy S10 having three variants. S10 Lite (to be officially called the Galaxy S10 E), S10 regular and S10 Plus. And by the leaks published by Ice universe, it shows three transparent cases. Which reveals a  5.8″ display , a  6.1″  and a  6.4″  on the phones, which probably belong to the Lite, Regular and Plus respectively.  Source: Twitter / Ice universe  Also, the leaks reveal battery sizes as well. The Lite variant will most likely have a  3100 mAh battery . This is actually a confirmation as the rumor was already there. But now, we have hinted at the battery sizes of the other two larger phones as well. The regular S10 will have a  3500 mAh battery  while the Plus model will most likely have  4000 mAh  of battery.        Source: Twitter / Ice universe  This makes these phones comparable to some current Samsung phones. Going by the display size, the S10 Lite can be compared to the  Galaxy S9 , the regular S10 to the S9 Plus and the S10 Plus to the  Note 9 . But, a video where he compares the Galaxy S10’s protection film to various Samsung devices, contradicts this. And it is clear in the video that the S10’s size is smaller than that of the S9 Plus. It is actually equal to the Galaxy S9. Yes, this might be confusing, but with Samsung being able to remove the chin and bezels, it might have been able to reduce the footprint of the device while keeping a bigger screen.   There may be pictures out there, but these are only leaks, though. The only thing we are sure of is that the Galaxy S10 lineups will all have the  Snapdragon 855  or the  Exynos 9820 SoC   on all variants. And not only that, being able to include a larger battery in a smaller footprint is actually impressive as well.   A few other leaks reveal that the Samsung Galaxy S10 E will be the only smartphone of the three to not come with an in-display fingerprint sensor. It will also be the one to include a flat screen. Furthermore, we also have a screenshot of it going through the Geekbench benchmarking app. The numbers are quite low, actually lower than the SD845, but the software isn’t quite in its final stages yet. By the final version, we should see a significant boost in these scores.   The final piece of leak comes from Samsung itself while trying to show off their new One UI. One of the screenshots of the UI revealed Samsung using a mockup of a certain smartphone with a hole punch display and curved edges. The only phone we know that matches these descriptions is the Galaxy S10 itself. Ergo an actual photo of the Galaxy S10 from Samsung.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-rumors.jpg']

But now, with the added 5% excise duty, and the rebate taken away, retailers pay a total of  over 18% tax  on smartphone import. Which has reduced the import of smartphones – at least legally. But the increase in grey market imports shows that many retailers might have resorted to importing these goods illegally. And this is more evident by the increase of new smartphone retailers in recent times.  Also Read:  Why are smartphones overpriced in Nepal?        According to data from Birgunj Customs office, the import of phones has gone down by 50%. While the number of phone imports last fiscal year was  2,49,280 in a period of 6 months , this year the number rested at  1,10,700  in the same amount of time. According to customs officials, the number has decreased due to the additional excise duties and revoking of the rebate.  Sources also claim that since there is less strict checking at open border areas, many phones make it inside Nepal illegally. And when many smartphone shops shut down during a raid by the officials, it only confirmed the suspicions.  Meanwhile, the  Mobile Phones Importers Association (MPIA)  has issued a letter that they will be carrying out necessary steps to discourage grey importers and illegal means. They claim that even if grey imports are beneficial to some, and while some consumers may get phones for cheap, it hurts the nation’s economy overall. Also, there is no surety of warranties, maintenance and such. All, of this, is true for the most part as well.  They announced they would warn all grey importers. And there would be legal actions to those who do not comply and will not receive any support from the Importers Association. This would mean that any retailer with grey market supplies would not get any kind of warranty facilities, phone imports or will not be made part of any schemes.  Will this help the current trend of smartphone import and  high pricing in Nepal ? Only time will tell, but for now, we have yet to see the policies implemented in action.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/smartphone-import-drop-nepal.jpg']

But besides televisions, the Chinese company also makes quite good smartphones. And this time, at CES 2019, it has revealed quite an interesting phone. Dubbed the  HiSense U30 , this phone packs quite the interesting specs.  First, it packs  Samsung’s ISOCELL Bright GM1 48 MP  sensor as the primary camera sensor at the back! What’s interesting about it is not only its large 48 MP sensor, but the ISOCELL technology is known for enhancing sharpness and detail in photos. So, the large resolution and ISOCELL technology is an interesting combo! The camera is also supported by  5 MP depth sensor  as well.  Source: Gizmochina  As for the selfie camera, this phone, too, jumped on the display-hole train. It features a  20 MP shooter  on the punch-hole. As for other aspects, it has a large  6.3″ Full HD+ display  with very thin bezels. But surprisingly, as is the trend, this phone still has a rear-mounted traditional fingerprint sensor.        Under the hood, the phone is powered by the new  Snapdragon 675 SoC . And this makes it the very first phone to do so. The Snapdragon 675 is a gaming-based octa-core chipset with considerable improvements over the Snapdragon 670. Besides that, the phone will have two RAM configurations –  6 GB and 8 GB , which seems to be the standard these days. But the  storage is fixed at 128 GB . Also, there is no expandable option.  Source: Gizmochina  With a huge  4500 mAh battery  and supporting  Quick Charge 4.0+ , this is turning out to be a very good phone in the paper. And combined with all the specs it has, we might be looking at an upper-class mid-range phone. The only questionable thing is that everything is packed in a “cow-hide” leather-ish type of design at the back. But this might be one more thing to make it look more interesting, maybe.  This phone will be officially launched in March and will be available in China, Russia and some parts of Europe. Pricing is under the veil for now.

It wasn’t a huge upgrade apart from the inclusion of 8th Gen Intel processors. Most of the design language, thermal solutions, including the display and keyboard remained exactly the same. Seems like Dell wanted to clear out the naming hassle before they gave their gaming series a proper upgrade including a 4-zone customizable RGB keyboard.  In comes the new Dell G5 and the Dell G7, a proper upgrade to the whole Inspiron Gaming series since the very beginning (Inspiron 7559). That’s saying a lot but it’s true. The Dell G7 sported the best GPU in the Inspiron lineup up till now. That was the GTX 1060 Max-Q, which has now been upgraded to an RTX 2080. Certainly, we do not know how the RTX 2080 performs, but even a poor guess shows it should be at least twice as fast if not more.  Dell Inspiron G7  The new Inspiron G7 comes in two different sizes, one with a 15-inch (7590) panel and the other is 17-inches (7790). For those who were excited about the OLED panel, it’s only coming to the 15-inch variant with UHD resolutions at 60Hz. The FHD panel, on the other hand, comes in both 60Hz and 144Hz for both the 15-inch and 17-inch models. Here is a table I made explaining this in a better way.

The first is an 8th Gen Quad-Core i5-8300HQ, the six-core i7-8750H or the overclockable i9-8950HK. That’s quite the selection for all the potential customers out there. If we talk GPUs, it’s an even larger selection. GPU choices include the GTX 1050Ti, RTX 2060, RTX 2070 Max-Q or the RTX 2080 Max-Q. Seems like Dell is going all out with the customizations.  Read More:  Alienware m15 and m17 refresh includes RTX graphics chips  The GPU and CPU can be paired with either 8 or 16GB of RAM with you can expand later on. As for storage, you get dual storage options with a maximum of 1TB NVMe SSD and 2TB HDD. If you thought these were the only customization options, well you are wrong. Dell is actually letting you choose between a 4-cell 60Whr battery or a larger 6-cell 90Wh battery on both the models. Sadly, with all these customization options, Dell is only offering one color option, Abyss Grey.  Connectivity includes Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Gigabit Killer Ethernet, and Dual-band Wi-Fi on all models. Ports include HDMI 2.0, 3x USB 3.1, microSD card reader, wedge lock and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Thunderbolt 3 (USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type C) is also available, but only on RTX enabled versions. Pricing for the base models begins at $1,099 for the Dell G7 15 while the G7 17 starts at $1,380.  Dell G5  The Dell G5 offers relatively fewer options to choose from, the first being it’s 15-inch display. The same can be configured at FHD@60Hz, FHD@144Hz or UHD@60Hz. The CPU options also follow the same, with either a Core i5-8300HQ or the Core i7-8750H. However, no compromises have been made in the GPU department. The choices still include the GTX 1050Ti, RTX 2060, RTX 2070 Max-Q and the fastest of all the RTX 2080 Max-Q.   The Dell G5’s RAM, storage, connectivity, and ports selections also remain identical to the newer G7. The one aspect the G5 outshines it’s elder brother is the option to choose from two colors instead of one. The regular G5 will come in a Deep Space Black Shade color, while the G5 SE, which probably stands for “Special Edition” is also available in Alpine White. Pricing starts at $999 for the base model.

So, this time at CES 2019, the company has put forward the  Z9G , Sony’s first 8K TV that seems really really huge!

So, the company has brought to the table a very huge one that is sized at 85 and 98 inches. Apart from these, Sony also has hinted that this year’s models are updated with the latest image processors and X- Reality PRO technology to be optimized especially for 8K content. This ensures that all the content looks as good as possible, regardless of their native resolution.

Razer Raptor Gaming Monitor  Razer just took the wraps off an all-new eSports oriented gaming monitor, the Razer Raptor. It’s a 27-inch IPS panel with a 4mn response rate. Whatever the specs may show, it’s cable management system is definitely the highlight here. The monitor shows five cables running across it’s back in the most perfect way, at least the renders appear that way.  The 4mn response rate can be reduced to a perfect 1ms with motion blur reduction. The Raptor is, however not a 4k monitor but sports a humble 2560×1440 resolution (WQHD) display. It can reach a maximum refresh\xa0rate of up to 144Hz and supports up to\xa095% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. Maximum brightness reaches up to 420-nits which is probably more than enough for indoor\xa0usage. The Raptor also supports HDR contents.        Sadly, if you just bought the new Turing graphics processors, this monitor only supports AMD’s free sync technology. You could look at Nvidia’s new Adaptive sync technology for a fix. Which you might give there is really no other monitor\xa0quite like this one. I mean it has a seriously thin 2.3mm bezels on all three side, except for the relatively thick bezels at the bottom.  It gets the Chroma-enabled base so you can sync all your Razer\xa0peripherals like mouse, keyboard headset or mousepad’s lighting with your monitor. The cable management you see in the picture above shows green lines running across it’s back. If you were wondering what they are, it’s the HDMI, Display Port, a USB port and finally the power port.  An actual over the top feature is the panel’s 90-degrees upwards tilt so you don’t need to turn your monitor while hooking up a cable. The base is just a big piece of aluminum providing the panel a firm stance. The Razer Raptor is priced at  $699  and will be in 2019 but an exact date hasn’t been revealed yet.  Razer Blade 15 Advanced   Razer announced a refresh to last year’s Blade 15 with an RTX GPU overhaul. The rejuvenation includes new display technologies, one of which featured an experimental OLED panel. A backup display showed off an FHD@240Hz\xa0panel. Sadly other components remain the same, which means it gets a Core i7-8750H, 16GB RAM and 512GB of SSD.

HP Spectre x360 15 with AMOLED display  The  HP Spectre x360 15  convertible is one of the company’s most well-received laptops. And as good as it is, it’s now getting better with an upgraded AMOLED display! OLED screens on laptops are not a new concept by any means as the  HP Spectre x360 13 had one back in 2016 , but this is the  first 15″ laptop with an AMOLED  panel.  But there are no changes in any of the other hardware components. The laptop will be the same HP Spectre x360 we’ve been seeing with all the regular configurations i.e. it will come equipped with the  8th-gen Intel i7 processor ,  16 GB RAM  and  512 GB of PCIe SSD storage . The only new addition, is as aforementioned, a new AMOLED display.  The new addition is not a very big deal, but it does come with a lot of benefits. It will provide users with bright picture quality ( 400 nits ) and good color accuracy ( 100% on the DCI-P3 color gamut ), wide horizontal viewing angles, deeper blacks and  faster response times  (up to 1 ms). The display will also  support HDR , but it is not clear as to HDR10 or Dolby Vision. Also unspecified is the resolution of the display, and the price of the laptop. But we can expect a slightly more increase in price than last years, I guess.  HP Omen Obelisk Desktop beefed up  HP’s fully customizable gaming tower, the  HP Omen Obelisk Desktop , with its starting price around $1000 was very appealing last year. And now, at CES 2019, the pre-built gaming machine gets a lot of upgrades, and can cost very well over $2200! But for that price, the desktop will be more powerful than ever before – with  9th-gen Intel Coffee-Lake processors , and top of the line RTX graphics!  There will be two options to choose from for the users, an  Obelisk 1010  or  1020 . The Obelisk 1010 will come with a  9th-gen Intel i9-9700K  processor and an  NVidia RTX 2080 graphics card . As for the latter, it will have the  Intel i9-9900K CPU  and the most powerful  NVidia RTX 2080 Ti . Both the models can feature up to  64 GB HyperX DDR4 RAM , and up to  512 GB dual M.2 SSD  with Raid 0 Array support.  It also supports  DTS Headphone X technology  and  5.1 Surround Sound  for better immersive audio quality. The Obelisk desktop also has an updated  750W\xa0Platinum PSU Dedicated Omen BIOS  for optimal settings and  Omen Command Center Software  with CPU Overclocking Support. With these upgrades, the HP Omen Obelisk will have a starting  price of $2249,\xa0 but this is actually cheaper than the likes of\xa0 Acer Predator Triton 900 !  HP Omen X Emperium 65 Gaming Monitor  This is not an upgrade from HP, this is something entirely new. And it is as scary as it is exciting! The name it itself packs quite a lot of weight, and it is something that HP teased a year ago. The  HP Omen X Emperium 65 Gaming Monitor  is HP’s first  NVidia BFGD (Big Format Gaming Display)  display for gaming. And it looks promising enough to provide one of the most immersive gaming experiences ever.  While there are many other such large displays, particularly TVs that play 4K (now even 8K), this one is built with gamers in mind. This gaming monitor is basically a  65″ screen with 4K resolution ,  95% DCI-P3 color accuracy , a  144 Hz refresh rate , and  NVidia’s G-Sync . And being a BFGD, it has a  full-size DisplayPort port  that can push out  higher frame rates along with 4K and HDR ; as opposed to present screens with HDMI 2.0 that support HDR and 4K but cannot play content higher than 60 fps.  The monitor features  HDR 10 support , with an  acclaimed peak brightness of 1000 nits brightness , and a standard 750 nits, and full array local dimming. Another exciting feature is it’s  soundbar –\xa0with 3 stereo amps at 120 watts and motion-activated port lighting . With that, when you play games on it, you might feel as if you’ve dropped into a real battle arena.  The display also comes with a built-in  NVidia Shield set-top box , so, you’ll have Android TV and Chromecast support as well. So, basically, a 4K TV if you’re not gaming in it. And that should be a feature, as this  costs a scary $5000 ! We are yet to see it in action, but maybe we will soon find out.  So, that’s some of the major highlights from HP this CES 2019. The most exciting for me is the HP Obelisk desktop. Which is your favorite one?

['Samsung Galaxy Watch Review – Luxury or a Necessity?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartwatch Price in Nepal']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 8, 2019']",2019-01-08 11:01:40+00:00,"['Since the beginning of smartwatches, we have kinda expected a lot from them. We expect them to be able to do a lot, but also be simple enough to use. But we are not quite there yet. And the  Samsung Galaxy Watch   is the perfect example of such. It is simple-ish, packs a lot of features, and tries to do a lot of things…yet, falls behind our expectations.  Samsung changed the naming convention for its smartwatches. The Gear S-series is now simply the Samsung Galaxy Watch, and with its improvements over the  Gear S3 Frontier , the change of the name is also not very surprising.         Also Read:  FitBit Smartwatches Price in Nepal  Samsung Galaxy Watch Specifications   Display : 1.3-inch (46mm) or 1.2-inch (42mm) Super AMOLED  Resolution : 360×360 pixels  Protection :\xa0Gorilla DX+ glass,\xa0IP68, and 5 ATM water resistance  Chipset : Exynos 9110 SoC  Processor : Dual Core 1.15GHz  OS : Tizen 4.0  RAM : 768MB  Connectivity :\xa0 Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi b/g/n, NFC, A-GPS/Glonass  Storage : 4GB  Battery : 472mAh (46mm) or 270mAh (42mm)  Battery Charging : WPC based wireless charging  Sensors : Heart rate monitor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Barometer, Ambient light sensor  Compatibility : Android 5.0 or higher & RAM 1.5GB above, iPhone 5 and above with iOS 9.0 or above   Design  As far as the design goes, the Samsung Galaxy Watch is quite elegant. It really looks like a wrist watch! And by that’s actually saying a lot.   In a world where smartwatches tend to look like a smartphone on your wrist (I’m talking about none other than the  Apple Watch ), its round shape with the subtly placed  buttons on the side looks  good. But in terms of looks, it is not that different from the last year’s Gear S3 or Gear Sport. This watch too has the same  rotating bezel  – which is also a clever way to navigate through the watch. This is pretty clever – your finger won’t block the small screen while scrolling about. And it is something so simple, yet, no one else thought of it.   There is a choice between two models – a  46 mm model  and a  42 mm model . The 46 mm model has a greater advantage over the smaller one. It comes with a larger battery, that claims 4-day of battery life, and a slightly larger screen at 1.3″. However, all the other things are the same.   The one we got our hands on is the smaller model, and that weighs only about  49 grams . The  20 mm rubber strap  is also very comfortable and you’ll have no problem keeping the watch on for 24 hours a day. The watch has just the right amount of heft to it with its  stainless steel case , and if you look closely at the details, you will appreciate the design. Also, the buttons on the side, are not intrusive at all. The placement makes it not so prone to accidental presses when you bend your wrist.  However, there are not many eye-catching things in the design. With very similar design to the Gear S3, it also looks like any other watch. And that’s where the Apple Watch played well – though it looks like a micro-smartphone, it looks different!   The Samsung Galaxy Watch is also  IP68 Water Resistant for 50 meters . And this time, it’s not only regular water resistatn. It’s designed to be  swim-proof , even with salt-water and chlorine resistance. So, you don’t have to worry while taking it for a swim.  Display  There is not much to talk about on the display front, though. The 42 mm model has a  1.2” display  with a  360 x 360 resolution . The 46mm model has a 1.3″, and that is a very negligible difference. It is easy to miss while measuring even.   The  Super AMOLED  panel is great, and that’s one of the best things about Samsung’s smartwatches. Yes, it is a small screen and the type of display may not even be that big od an issue. But AMOLED gives you deeper blacks, and with so many watch faces having a dark interface, that is somewhat of a big deal in this one. The brightness of the watch is aso commendable. It is quite visible at all times – in the sunlight, indoors, or wherever, thanks to its  Adaptive Brightness feature .  You also have the Always-on display option, but that can chug your battery like water. So, unless you’re okay with charging it every night, you should keep it off.  In addition, the screen has military grade protection with  Gorilla Glass DX+  on it. Samsung claims it’s uncrackable…and, I believe them. This watch was abused a lot, and took hits while playing football, yet, there was not even a scratch on it. And for other companies that do not understand this, they should now. Watches tend to be abused a lot in our daily lives. So, some kind of protection is mandatory.  Battery  Many smartwatches tend to struggle in the battery department. But the Samsung Galaxy Watch stays on the safe side with this one. The larger 46 mm watch has a good 472 mAh battery, and that claims 4 days of battery life. And it might last a good amount of over three days with heavy usage.  But for our smaller model, that is not the case. For a very less difference in size, the difference in the battery is huge. The 42 mm unit has a small  270 mAh battery  – almost half the size. And while Samsung claims 3 days of battery life, that is not so. For me, the battery lasted only slightly over 2 days. And that, too, on regular usage only – when I had the always-on display setting off.   If you keep it on, the battery life is very poor. And for a battery that size, charging time is considerably long. It takes  close to 2 hours to fully charge  with its charging dock.  Also, if your phone has a small battery size, that’s something else you need to worry about. Since the watch is connected to your phone via bluetooth at all times, your phone’s battery will drain a lot faster too.  Performance  The Samsung Galaxy Watch runs on  Tizen OS  – Samsung’s own OS for its smartwatches. And that’s for the best. The rotating bezel for navigation is Tizen’s own little neat feature. You can also use your watch with non-Samsung devices and iPhones, by just downloading the  Galaxy Wear app , but some apps are limited to Samsung Experience OS. And iOS support is very limited on iPhones. So, the best experience is when you’re connected to the S-series flagships or Note-series.      Samsung galaxy watch galaxy wear app   1  of 3               Info         Watch Faces         Settings                     Spec wise, there’s the  1.15 GHz Exynos 9115 dual-core processor  with\xa0 768 MB of RAM , and I guess that keeps the watch zippy as it is. The watch does not demand too much, so, that much is enough. However, if you get the LTE version, you get 1.5 GB of RAM on it.      Samsung Galaxy Watch Watch Faces   1  of 4                                                          Tizen OS also gives you a lot of watch faces to choose from – and as much as that can be overwhelming, all those alternatives with options to customize your own is very welcome. You can change the watch faces from your watch itself or even through the Galaxy Wear app on your phone.  Feature wise, there are a lot of things packed into the watch, whether you use it or not. the watch functions as your  health monitor ,  notifications manager ,  music player , etc.      Samsung Galaxy Watch   1  of 2               Music Player         Notification                  You can get all your phone’s notifications on your watch. But of course, there are limitations. It won’t show any images sent to you, for which you have to check your phone. Also, if you want to reply to a message, you have to type letter by letter, that too, using gestures, and that is time-consuming. It is easier to just get your phone and reply back.  The watch also allows you to make calls via a Bluetooth connection to your phone. But if you have more than 1 SIM on it, and you have not set a default, you will have to again, choose on your phone. That kind of defeats the purpose. And if you carry your phone at all times with you, calling is not a very useful feature. But even so, the call quality is okay, though.   The most comprehensive of all is the health monitor feature. It tracks your sleep, breath, heart rate, stress, etc. The sleep tracker is quite accurate too. And it has an  expanded 39 exercise trackers , which goes from basic walking to various gym workouts like bench press and deadlifts. Some of them are accurate, while others are not. 6 of them, which are the most basic ones, are automatically detected.  For instance, the walking and running tracker was super accurate. It counts the number of steps walked down to the last step and doesn’t miss even the casual two-three steps to the bed or sofa either. And it shows you how much calories you’ve burnt too. If you are doing arm curls or crunches, it keeps track of them very well. But for some exercises, like push-ups or leg-workouts, it counts the time rather than the number of reps. Of course, it has to do with the watch being on your hand. The gyro-sensor can sense the movement of the watch on your hand for some exercises, while not so much on others.  And while I’m at it, there were some instances when the watch wrongly tracked my movements. I was riding my motorbike, but the watch recorded it as if I was cycling.  The watch is awoken by your hand movement. If you keep the always-on display off, you need to bring the watch close to your face with a swift movement to wake it to see the time. Subtle movements won’t register, like if you’re typing on your computer, and you move it slightly, it won’t wake up. And that can be annoying at times.  These issues were present on the Gear S3 too, and it’s still here. The Galaxy Watch has a lot of improvements, but not on this department it seems. So, that’s something Samsung really needs to figure out.  In the health department, there are also options to manually log in your coffee, water or meal intakes, but I don’t think anyone does that. Maybe some who are really trying to get in shape or are health conscious. And that too is easy to forget to log into every time, so your calories consumption measurement will come out inaccurate most of the time.\xa0So, that is something I rarely use.  Talking of other things I don’t use, it has  Bixby voice assistant  as well. While I don’t even prefer Bixby on my phone, here, it seems to work less accurately than on your phone. Also, I think a voice assistant on a smartwatch is not that helpful. But if they had to put in one, they should have gone with Google Assistant.  The Samsung Galaxy Watch also supports Spotify, which seems region specific. But if you want to listen to music normally, you have to transfer your music files from your phone to the watch, with the help of the app. There’s  4 GB of storage  space inside to store some pictures and music. Also, the audio quality is good enough for a watch. Now, listening to music on your watch is not something you’ll do often, but it is kinda fun while doing some small chores like cleaning your room, or things like that.  Conclusion  To sum up, there comes a question what is this watch really about? It tries to do a lot of things, but many would not even use half of it. The regular  42 mm costs $329 , and it is pretty close to that in Nepal too. And I feel like the watch does justify the cost, but the usage does not.  The design is great, the display is great, some functions are very useful.\xa0But, like I said, it does things, most of us won’t even use. The comprehensive health and fitness features are great, but there are fitness bands for cheaper that can get the job done. As for other things, we use our phones anyway.  So, it is clear that this watch is not for everyone. In fact, it is not for most people. But if you want a fancy smartwatch with a lot of features, then, go for it. It can save you from having to glance at your phone every now and then too. And if you’re a very health conscious person, this is a great option that can do things many fitness bands can’t.  But if Samsung could have made a less fancy smartwatch with basic features for the lesser price, that would be actually better. Like  J-series of the Watch  for $100 or so, that would be more interesting.  For now, the  Samsung Galaxy Watch feels more like a luxury , not a necessity. So, this is a watch that’s really smart, but right now…it’s ahead of its time.  Pros:   Classy and Elegant design  Solid stainless steel construction  IP68 Water Resistance and Gorilla Glass DX+ protection  Comfortable to wear  Tizen OS clever implementation  Packed with features  Comprehensive fitness tracking   Cons:   Poor battery life  Bixby voice assistant  Poor Bluetooth connectivity  A lot of features which everyone won’t use']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/samsung-galaxy-watch-review.jpg']

['CES 2019: MSI launches laptops and desktop PCs powered by the new RTX graphics'],"['CES 2019', 'MSI']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['January 8, 2019']",2019-01-08 09:54:13+00:00,"['MSI hasn’t\xa0quite disappointed\xa0us yet when it comes to gaming\xa0laptops. Their try at the ultrabook market with their prestige series has been quite overwhelming. The problem is we never really associate MSI with ultrabooks or anything that isn’t gaming. But here we are, MSI has launched three new laptops in  CES 2019 , only two of which are gaming laptops. We also got a new Desktop PC and a CPU case, which we will get into later.  MSI GS75 Stealth  This is a thin and light offering from MSI but with an RTX 2080 (Max-Q) GPU in a 0.75-inch thick aluminum alloy body. To go with the RTX 2080 MSI is hoping that the 8th Gen i7 processor should do the work. We are expecting it to not come with the 8750H but a more beefed up 8850H CPU, but for the time being, we do not know. A 144Hz 17.3-inch display delightfully wraps everything up in a sweet little package.         This just goes to show that powerful gaming laptops don’t need to be thick and bulky. According to MSI “the GS series breaks the stereotype of bulky and heavy gaming laptops, offering an exceptional and portable gaming experience.” They are also planning a refresh to their GS65 laptops with the\xa0latest gen processors and GPUs in a 4.19-pound body. This said laptop will follow a traditional 15.6″ display.  MSI has also improved on the thermal solutions for the GS75 Stealth with it’s Cooler Boost Trinity+ fans. This new cooling interpretation is supposedly\xa0a lot more efficient. We also do not have any information on the RAM sizes, but we do know this small laptop can fit up to three NVMe SSDs. Unfortunately, MSI hasn’t disclosed the pricing, or availability for the world’s first 17″ thin and light laptop with an RTX 2080 inside.  MSI GE75 Raider  The MSI GE75 Raider might not be as thin and light, but it does come with per-key customizable RGB lighting keyboard. Sure the specs seem great with the RTX 2080 GPU and latest gen i7 processor, but we are getting a lot more styling point with this one. The laptop comes with a reflective diamond\xa0cut trim and a red anodized finish. The design patterns have been solely crafted to entice the enthusiasts.   Back to the spec sheet, this also comes with a 17″ panel with fairly thin display bezels. It also gets a really nice set of audio output with Dynaudio. The cooling\xa0department also sees improvements, with MSI’s Cooler Boost 5 technology which gets two dedicated fans and seven copper heat pipes. Sadly, we have no information on the laptop’s pricing, configurable specs, and availability.  MSI PS63 Modern   Finally, we have come to a not so powerful laptop, the MSI PS63 modern. It doesn’t share a really any design queues with its siblings above, but it does hold up its own in terms of thickness, and battery life. Firstly, it comes with an Intel Core i7 processor, a GTX 1050 GPU and a 15.6″ display. It’s fairly thin at 0.63-inches, and weights just 1.6Kgs. It also gets a fingerprint reader and a claimed 16-hour battery life with Quick Charge 3.0 support.  MSI’s other product announcements        1  of 2               Gaming PC casing         Gaming PC                  Other than laptops, MSI also showed us a gaming desktop, the  MSI Trident X . This desktop gets Intel’s 9th Gen K series processors and RTX graphics cards, although MSI didn’t specify any. There is also a compact version to continue on their Infinite series compact desktops, dubbed the  MSI Infinite S  Gaming. They also showed us their new innovative Silent Storm Liquid Cooling System.  Finally, the last product from MSI was the\xa0 MSI Gungnir 100  PC casing. It’s a gaming PC casing that MSI describes was “inspired by the sharp look and feel of ‘Gungnir’, the legendary spear wielded by the Norse god Odin”. Other than that, we can expect MSI to come up with an MSI version of the just-released  RTX 2060 .

['CES 2019: Acer showcased a variety of laptops ranging from power to portability'],"['Acer', 'CES 2019']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 8, 2019']",2019-01-08 07:43:34+00:00,"['There are just so many companies jousting to showcase their latest and the best at CES 2019. And even if you are totally crazy about tech, things are too much to handle! With companies like  ASUS having shown their hands , Acer has some on its sleeves as well. This CES, Acer has three new laptops up its sleeve.  Acer Predator Triton 900   While Acer did tease this beast back at IFA 2018, the fully functional model is only now up for the show. And this is the combination of Beauty and the Beast both, to say the least. And to call it only a laptop seems undermining, too. It features the impressively engineered “ Ezel Aero Hinge ” that lets you have  four usage modes . You can flip it over to make an entertainment-only system, slap it down for tablet only mode, a stand mode for efficient working, and the usual notebook mode.         But that is only the aesthetics part of it. In terms of hardware, the laptop packs an immersive  17″ 4K IPS display  with  NVidia’s G-Sync  technology. It is powered by the  8th-gen Intel i7-8750H processor  with  RTX 2080 graphics . It packs  32 GB of RAM  and  PCIe SSD storage options in a Raid 0 Array . That is a lot of power to handle, and to support it, the laptop features  4th Gen AeroBlade cooling  with  CoolBoost technology .  With all that it packs, it is not surprising that it is almost 2.4 cm thick, and that it costs a  whopping $4000 ! It will be available for purchase around March. Designs like this, and that of the  ASUS ROG Mothership , are great refreshing views from the usual laptops, and we expect to see more by the time CES 2019 is over.  Acer Predator Triton 500  With all that it offers, the Acer Triton 900 is a very compelling piece of a laptop. But of course, $4000 is a lot of bucks to shell out. So, should you want a great gaming laptop from the Triton range, but don’t want to spend as much, there is the new Acer Predator Triton 500.   This is nowhere close to the Beauty and the Beast combo of the Triton 900, aesthetics wise. But this more affordable option packs a lot of the same hardware inside a conventional notebook chassis.  The Predator Triton 500 features a  15.6″ 1080 display  with  144 Hz refresh rate  and  3 milliseconds  of response time. It, too, is powered by the latest  8th-gen Intel i7-8750H processor  with the latest RTX 2080 graphics too. Only, you get the slightly less powerful  RTX 2080 Max-Q  on this one. But you also have a RTX 2060 configuration available. Besides that, you get  PCI SSDs in Raid 0 array\xa0 too, and can have up to  32 GB RAM .  At  $1800 , this is a much affordable deal for those who want a portable gaming machine. But of course, if you’re looking for something that stands out, this is not something that will.  Acer Swift 7 2019  Acer’s Swift 7 was a hihgly portable notebook when it came out, too, but now, they’ve made it even smaller. In fact, so much so, that it is a laptop with  second most-thinnest bezels  with a  92% screen real estate . The first position, of course, went to the  ASUS Zenbook S13 , with a screen real estate of 97%. But this one, is lighter weighing under 1 kg!   But such a slim chassis comes with some compromises. To maintain the small size, there are  no cooling mechanisms inside . And so, the only option to manage thermals is to integrate a very power-efficient Intel Y-Core CPUs. And this leads to sacrificing quite the power. You get an  Intel i7-8500Y CPU  inside, combined with  16 GB RAM , and up to  512 GB storage . That makes it suitable only for the road warriors, not for those doing heavy workloads.\xa0For an asking  price of $1700 , the configuration seems not so worth it.  Besides, that. the display is a  1080 IPS panel  with  100% sRGB color gamut  and ample  300 nits of brightness . And with an extremely conservative design, there’s nothing eye-catching or compelling feature about this. Which is why,\xa0 even thouh this is pretty slim and sleek, it doesn’t get enough attention.

This is exactly what makes the Samsung Notebook Odyssey a piece of newsworthy news. Samsung has been trying to get into the laptop business for quite a while now, however, hasn’t quite worked out yet. Ask yourself, do you ever think of Samsung when it comes to gaming laptops?  Read More:  Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Launched for $349  With the Samsung Notebook Odyssey, things look encouraging. This new laptop comes with a six-core i7 processor and Nvidia’s RTX 2080 GPU. Pair those specs with 16GB of RAM, 256GB NVMe storage, 1TB hard drive and a USB-C port, which was weirdly missing last time. This seemingly looks like a beast of a laptop, but the issue wasn’t specs, it was the design and the display.        Addressing the second issue first, this laptop comes with a 15.6-inch 144Hz 1920×1080 resolution panel with Nvidia G-Sync support. This should fix their problems in the display department. So, back to the first problem then. The laptop gets a fresh new design with an all-metal chassis. The display gets a relatively huge bezel at the bottom while the top and the sides offer very minimal edges.  Read More:  New Laptops from Asus in CES 2019  Samsung even managed to fit the webcam up top. The laptop doesn’t exactly scream gaming either, which is actually a good thing. Plus at just 5.2 pounds, it’s a gaming laptop with an RTX 2080 inside, can we even expect lesser numbers? Samsung says the laptop comes with a new cooling system, with five heat pipes and more blades on system fans than before.  There is no information about the laptop’s pricing just yet, although we do know the Notebook will be available by early 2019 in the US.

['CES 2019: ASUS impressed the audiences with handful of laptops'],"['Asus', 'CES 2019']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['January 7, 2019']",2019-01-07 12:00:16+00:00,"['So the annual Consumer Electronics Show is now underway in Las Vegas. The 2019 edition of CES, of course, will showcase amazing technology too, but for the most part, there will be upgrades. And ASUS, the laptop manufacturer seems like it has its hands full. There are just an overwhelming amount of releases and upgrades. See some of them in here:  ASUS ROG Strix II series updated with RTX Graphics  The ASUS ROG Strix II series of gaming laptops were one of the best around. They were not quite up to the top, but have a good set of configurations nonetheless. The  ASUS ROG Strix Hero II  and the ASUS ROG Strix Scar II are the ones that belong to this lineup. Both these laptops have full-fledged desktop style keyboards with RGB lighting and pretty swell design and build. Both of these also have a  144 Hz display  with  3 ms of response time . In addition, both of these pack the  Hexa-core 8th-gen Intel i7-8750H  processor, up to  32 GB RAM , and  GTX 1060  graphics.         The Scar II is FPS-games based whereas the Hero II is for MOBA gamers – as differentiated by the W-A-S-D and Q-W-E-R highlighting on the keyboard respectively. The difference is that the Scar II is available in 15.6″ and 17.3″ display options while the Hero II is only in available in a 15.6″ model. And now, both these laptops are updated with  RTX 2060 graphics  for better gaming performance. The Scar II can have 2 graphics options, an RTX 2060 and RTX 2070, while the Hero II will ship with RTX 2060.  Of course, we will see an increment in price as well, but for now, there’s no word on it. and these laptops will be available for purchase in a few months.  ASUS Zephyrus getting bigger  ASUS gaming notebook, the ASUS Zephyrus, now, has a bigger version with a  17″ screen . The new variant is called the GX701, or the  ASUS Zephyrus S 17 , which is not surprising. There are not many changes in the other aspects of the gaming laptop except for the bigger screen. The Zephyrus S 17 will have the same  1080 panel , with  144Hz refresh rate  and  3 milliseconds of response time .  Everything else, too, is pretty similar with the ASUS Zephyrus S 17 being powered with the  8th-gen Intel i7-8750H  as well. But the new one has the  RTX 20-series of graphics , with configuration available all the way up to RTX 2080. It can also pack up to  24 GB of RAM .   The screen resolution might be a bit low for the larger screen, so, we might see 1440p or 4K variants as well. But the 1080 panel on a 17″ screen is also more immersive than 15″ ones, though. While all the other aesthetics part remains the same too, yes, even the footprint of the device, this one is a bit thicker at 1.8 cm. But that is still pretty sleek for a gaming laptop. It still retains the awkward keyboard and trackpad configuration, but that doesn’t seem to be that big of an issue with anyone.  Also, an improvement over the regular Zephyrus S is that it has a separate USB-C charger if you’re not gaming. This is light enough to carry around, just like the laptop. Again, there is no word on pricing. And the Zephyrus S 17 will be available for purchase in the first quarter of 2019.  ASUS ROG Mothership – Mother of Gaming Laptops?  There are so many gaming laptops these days, that many of them tend to look the same…give or take a few slight changes in aesthetics. And then, there’s the  ASUS ROG Mothership  – a new 17″ gaming laptop that sort of fits the name. First and foremost, a button will trigger a kickstand to pop out from behind the display, and the keyboard is detachable to be used wirelessly if you want.  All the processing components are behind the screen, and so, the ‘monitor’ or the display part is quite chunky. Hence, the requirement of the kickstand to support it. And this laptop is also powered by  NVidia’s RTX 20-series graphics . Packing everything on the display part helps this laptop get better airflow, which will improve the thermals as well. Plus, the  detachable keyboard  means you can attach another wired gaming keyboard to play games with as well.   The screen also features a  144Hz refresh rate ,  3 milliseconds of response time  and NVidia’s G-Sync. Under the hood, it is powered by the  Intel’s Core i9-8950HK CPU , and you can cram up to  64 GB of RAM . And if you really feel like it, you can run up to three  512 GB NVme SSDs in a Raid 0 array ! But all of this doesn’t come in a small package, though. You’re looking at a  4.6 kg  beast. This makes it less of a laptop, and more of a strange desktop…but you can carry it around if you don’t mind a bit of back-aches.  Of course, this is just very recent, so, no pricing information about this either. But I’d expect it to cost equal to the highest-end gaming PCs – if not more. As strange as this laptop looks, we have to commend ASUS on how it’s trying to reinvent gaming laptops.  ASUS Zenbook S13 – Worlds slimmest bezels on a laptop  ASUS Zenbooks \xa0are all about portability, but their S-series take it one step further. With the ambition of extreme portability in mind, the new and updated  ASUS Zenbook S13  packs even more in its sleek body. First off, you will notice what it advertises – the slimmest of  bezels on a screen at 2.5 mm ! The laptop has a  13.9″ IPS screen  and the bezels around it are next to invisible.  This raises a question about the position of the webcam. But unlike other laptops who opt for a bottom-placed webcam for thin bezels, the webcam is right on top – but on a “reverse-notch” of sorts. There is a  slight bump on top of the laptop screen  that houses the webcam, and it can actually help you open up the laptop more easily.   Also, at  1.29 cm thick , this could be the slimmest laptop in the world now too! And since it weighs only  1.13 kgs , we can assume it is not for power-hungry users, obviously! There are a few configurations – you can either choose one with  Intel i5-8265U  or an  i7-8565U  for better performance. It can pack up to  16 GB RAM , and if you choose, you can opt for one with  NVidia GeForce M150 graphics .  Again, no word on pricing, but ASUS Zenbooks are not known for affordability. So, don’t hold your breath. This, too, will be available in the first few months of 2019.  ASUS StudioBook – a portable Workstation  By now, you must be pretty darn confused with the lineups of these ASUS laptops. Zenbook, Zephyrus, and what not and that S-series on top supposed to be more portable than the regular ones? Well, brace yourselves. There’s the  ASUS StudioBook S -series now – which combines portability with a raw performance!  Now workstation might mean different things to different people. Generally, they are for business people, but this workstation has a different idea. The StudioBook is a workstation for content creators – movie editors, VR builders, and the likes. And to do so, you all know that it requires some serious power!   So, just how powerful is this thing? For starters, it comes in two configurations:  the 2.2 GHz 8th-gen Intel i7-8750H  or for some more power,  2.7 GHz Hexa-core Xeon E-2716M . It can also pack up to  64 GB of DDR4 RAM  and a whopping  4 TB of NVMe storage ! There are also plenty of ports in here – a USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, three USB As, an HDMI, and an SDcard reader as well.  Since it is a workstation for content creation, the screen needs to be just right too, and it actually is. Its\xa0 17″ display with 16:10 aspect ratio \xa0looks pretty cool, and it has about  97% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage , so, no need to worry about color accuracy. But the body packs only a  57 Whr battery , which might be easy to burn through during heavy workloads.  With this, there is no need to stay glued to your desk while creating or manipulating content. And this is just another of ASUS’ innovation for its laptops. And just by looking at the spec sheet, you can guess the price range pretty easily as well.  So, these are the ASUS latest releases in the CES 2019. With all of these, ASUS seems to have its hands full… Let’s see how these hold up this year.

Take for instance that 4k display on the  Sony Xperia Z5 Premium , a first for smartphones. Then they greet you with their first 18:9 display on smartphones, a whole one year late to the party. Although that is the past, the first Sony smartphone with a 2k display still remains fresh. As for now, rumors of the Sony Xperia XZ4 has come up and it features a whopping\xa021:9 ratio display.  Read More:  Sony Mobile Price in Nepal  A 21:9 display on a smartphone isn’t something new, but Sony seems to be the first mainstream smartphone to do so. Leaked specs include a 6.5-inch panel stretched out over 166.9mm in height. You can watch the video below for an idea on exactly how it will feel to watch a movie on this said smartphone. The video was uploaded by Ice Universe, which is said to be a very reputable “leakster”. The leakster has also recently leaked some of the important details of the  Samsung Galaxy S10 .         The display isn’t really that tall, sizing at about the same display real estate as an  iPhone XS Max  vertically. But when the width comes into play, it just changes the whole perspective. One of the very possible uses of this display could be watching movies that were created in this aspect ratio, which is most of them. Apart from that, this display will offer very little functionality when it comes to real life usage.  Sony Xperia XZ4 Leaks and Speculations  That is all we are going to talk about displays for now, as the phone is said to launch with an impressive\xa0set of internals. The first of which is the inclusion of a  Snapdragon 855  chipset with 6GB of RAM. Speculations of its internal storage show 64GB or 256GB,  very specific . As for cameras, the back will feature a 1/2.3″ sensor with OIS and a single wide-angle sensor at the front.   Finally, the battery life is reported to be a 3,900mAh unit and will boot on Android Pie with Sony’s own UI on top. As for the launch of the Xperia ZX4, Sony might hold an event in the CES in January. If that doesn’t pan out, we will likely see it launch at the MWC in February.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Sony-Xperia-XZ4.jpg']

Speculated to be named after the  Xiaomi Mi Play , it shares a lot of similarities with its rivals. Sadly it makes no resemblance to last year’s Honor Play.

But with smartphone companies pushing out foldable smartphones very soon, it won’t be necessary. Royole, a California based startup, became the first company to push out a foldable smartphone. The  FlexPai  is a phone with a 7.8″ AMOLED panel with Full HD+ resolution when unfolded. But since it is the first foldable phone, there are some aspects it could improve on.  And another company, which is a screen manufacturer has unveiled its version of foldable displays. BOE, a Chinese company had the same idea. It has released a demo of its OLED panel that has a very minimal  fold radius of 1 mm .         The demo shows a  7.65″ of AMOLED panel  with a  WQHD resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels . Other features reveal that it has  380 nits of brightness , a really low response time of 1 millisecond and a  color gamut of 118%  on the NTSC scale. While these are not very impressive features for an OLED screen, the company has addressed the aesthetics part of the foldable display.  The bend/fold radius on this device is only 1mm, which is the smallest up to now. And that looks pretty neat while bent. It might not matter to everyone, but aesthetically, it is pretty satisfying to have.  The company also claims about  100,000 bends  to give an idea of its durability. Yes, that is not a very big number for a smartphone, but for now, it is only in its demo stages, i.e. it is still in its Prototype Model. So, when it does come out commercially, we might see a more durable panel. For now, it seems like we’re getting somewhere with foldable displays.  And we’re not sure which smartphone company will be the first to integrate this panel. But yes, we’re expecting quite a few of those in 2019!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/boe-foldable-display-.jpg']

The  Huawei P20 Pro  is still the highest rated smartphone by DxOMark (at the time this article was written). But besides the camera, the phone in itself, was a great phone overall, although a bit on the expensive side. Nevertheless, it was a pretty well-received phone by the people.  And now, it is near about time for a new P-series flagship to hit the markets. So, if you hear more P30 rumors and such, don’t be surprised. There is also now a CAD-based render and a 360-degree video showing all sides of the phone. And to say the least, the phone does not look surprising at all.  Source: Onleaks  The Huawei P30 has the same  glass body in dual-tone gradient colors , which Huawei seems to be very fond of. It’s a glass back has a similar texture to that of the Mate 20 Pro as well. Of course, you get the  triple-camera setup  at the back on a slight camera bump with the LED flash below it. There is no fingerprint sensor at the back, which can only mean we’ll get an  in-display fingerprint sensor .        On the front, the screen measures around 6″, and features a  water-drop notch  on top housing the front camera. This is not surprising at all, as we’ve seen such many phones throughout 2018. And by the looks of it, we’ll see phones with similar designs throughout the year.  Source: Onleaks  The only surprise, here, is that the phone still seems to retain the  3.5 mm headphone jack ! And since the Mate 20 Pro did away with it, the P30 Pro still having is a good thing, albeit a surprise.  In terms of specs, we might be expecting a  38 MP main lens  as a part of the triple camera setup and a  24 MP selfie camera . The cameras should be one of the best, knowing the cameras on Huawei flagships. Underneath, we’ll surely find the  Kirin 980 chipset .

The Mi8 Lite also has a fair share of competition with  Huawei Y9 2019  now priced at Rs. 31,490 and  Honor 8X  now available in Nepal for Rs. 32,490.

It has won the hearts of lots of reviewers, and it even won that blind smartphone camera test from MKBHD. And at a time where each smartphone has to win the innovation game to be in the race, the Mate 20 pro definitely stands out in the crowd.  The Huawei Mate 20 pro is an absolute beast of a device and if you are thinking of getting it, you should. To tell you why this article will give you not just 6 but 7 major aspects that make this device a worthy purchase.         Huawei Mate 20 Pro Specifications   Display:\xa0 6.39-inch AMOLED display, Gorilla Glass protection  Resolution:\xa0 Full-HD+ (1440× 3120 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio, 538 PPI  OS:\xa0 Android 9.0 (Pie) with EMUI 9.0 on the top  Chipset: \xa0Huawei’s HiSilicon Kirin 980, 7nm mobile platform  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core (2×2.6 GHz Cortex-A76 & 2×1.92 GHz Cortex-A76 & 4×1.8 GHz Cortex-A55)  GPU :\xa0Mali G76 MP10  RAM:\xa0 6GB  Storage:\xa0 128GB; Nano memory (NM) card slot for memory expansion (Uses SIM2 slot)  Rear Camera:\xa0 Triple camera – (40 MP, f/1.8, 27mm (wide), 1/1.7″, PDAF/Laser AF) + (20 MP, f/2.2, 16mm (ultrawide), 1/2.7″, PDAF/Laser AF 8 MP, f/2.4, 80mm (telephoto), 1/4″, 5x optical zoom, OIS, PDAF/Laser AF), Leica Optics, Dual-LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 24 MP, f/2.0  Sensors:\xa0 Face ID, Fingerprint (under display), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, barometer, compass  Connectivity:\xa0 Dual SIM (Nano SIM + Nano SIM/NM), Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 5, GPS + GLONASS,\xa0USB Type-C, No 3.5mm headphone jack  Battery:\xa0 4200mAh with Supercharge technology (40W fast charging), Supports Wireless Fast charging (15watts) and reverse wireless charging  Colors:\xa0 Emerald Green, Midnight Blue, Twilight, Pink Gold, Black  Latest Price: Rs. 1,29,900   Design  The first aspect I will talk about is the design. Well, looking at the phone, at first sight, you definitely get some good reactions. The green version of the Mate 20 Pro has this pattern design on the back, that sets itself apart from the rest of the traditional glass backs. The new design looks great and once you run your nails through it, you kind of want to do it again and again. But, if asked, one should definitely go for the Green version because it looks way more appealing than the regular Black version. Plus you get textured back with the Green one.  But this back is somewhat a negative aspect of this device as well because the glass back is very slippery. And although it looks very premium, you will have to be extra careful whenever using it. One piece of advice, if you are using this device, cover it with a case at all times. Plus that will also help get rid of the fingerprints that cover up the back.   The power button here comes in a different color, so that’s a neat touch. And even with the large size, the buttons are placed in an ergonomic fashion. There is a metallic bracket on the middle, just like most of the glass-built phones.  Also read:  Huawei Mobiles Price in Nepal  Display   Let’s talk about the display now. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro comes with a 6.4-inch display with a notch on the top. Even though the Mate 20 features the waterdrop notch, this one here has this wide notch which houses Face Recognition sensor. There is a little bit of a chin on the bottom, and the talking points about this display are the curves on the left and right which are not as immersive as other curved phones.  But it’s the same display that shines brightly here. This is probably the second best display on any Android smartphone right now, after the Galaxy Note 9. You should actually hold the phone on your hand to know its quality.   The AMOLED panel helps with the WQHD+ display to result in a crisp one that is well saturated and quite vibrant. It gets bright, without any obstruction under direct sunlight. Now in the previous years, one would probably say that phones other than Samsung’s had a lot to do in terms of display, but this time, it’s actually great. There is nothing to complain about. And the viewing angle is great too like you would want on a flagship phone. The device also lets you toggle its resolution. So, just like in some of the Samsung devices, the Mate 20 Pro has an option to change the resolution. This definitely helps with preserving battery. However, unlike Samsung, the display only shows the time, date and battery percentage with the Always-on-display toggled, there is no support for 3 rd  party app notifications with the feature.  Performance  Now let’s talk about the aspect which can actually make or break a smartphone, the performance! The Mate 20 Pro is among the couple of smartphones that features a 7nm chipset. The  Kirin 980  is a direct competitor to the  Snapdragon 845 . And what a great work Huawei has done with this CPU. There are fast phones, and then there are the faster ones. Well, Huawei’s new device lies among the top ones on that list, as I have had absolutely no issues whatsoever with the phone. I am using the  Galaxy Note 9  as my primary device, and reviewing the Mate 20 Pro, well I think they are neck-to-neck. Both the phones have served me well without lagging behind or stuttering.  While playing games too, the graphical side of things links well with the CPU to provide users with the best result possible. Games like PubG has been a great experience. Now there was this issue I faced at first. I could not play PubG on High Definition and HDR setting, which is weird for a phone that comes in a hefty price tag. But after a couple of updates, there have been no problems.  The A12 Bionic chipset from Apple is the fastest, but the Mate 20 Pro with its Kirin 980 is not so far behind. Check out the scores from some of the benchmark tests I conducted on the phone.  Software and UI  On to the software now, the Mate 20 Pro runs on Huawei’s very own EMUI on top of  Android Pie . We have been praising Huawei for bettering their software over the years, but it’s high time Huawei starts thinking about the future of EMUI. There are still unwanted apps on the device that are forced on to the user. If a user really wants these apps, they will download it. Yes, there is ample RAM and the chipset is fast, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Huawei can push unwanted applications to its users.  Also, its UI is still reminiscent of iOS, and the settings app clearly tells the tale here. And even with the customizations in place, Huawei really needs to work on its software, if it really wants its phones to shine brighter than the rest. But there is still a silver lining, some of these customizations here, like the knuckle gesture to capture screenshots, come in really handy.  Camera   The  Huawei P20 Pro  was the first smartphones with triple lenses. Fast forward to the present, there are lots of smartphones with 3 cameras, and the Mate 20 Pro is an addition to that list. However, the cameras that are on this device serve a different purpose than the ones on the P20 Pro.  For starters, there is an ultra-wide camera instead of a monochrome sensor, and wow doesn’t this really work.  Even when the subject is closer, the camera can really work its way to bring out the widest view possible. You will definitely need a good DSLR camera with a wide lens just to capture something like this, and here is the mate 20 pro doing it with its  Leica  branded lenses. This feature comes in handy when you have a lot to capture in a small space. Check out some wide angle samples below:      Huawei-Mate-20-pro-wide-angle-camera-samples   1  of 3                                                The wide-angle mode is displayed as 0.6x while the phone can get up to 5x hybrid zoom. And going through the 0.6x to 3x to 5x, there is no significant loss in quality. So, that’s a plus.      Huawei Mate 20 pro Normal vs Wide angle samples   1  of 4               Normal         Ultra wide-angle         Normal         Ultra Wide-angle                        Then there are normal samples with the best of image quality. The pictures come out having a mixture of a good amount of saturation and colors. \xa0They are sharp and are really pleasing to the eye.      Huawei Mate 20 pro normal camera samples   1  of 8                                                                                                  Huawei smartphones are known for overexposing images at times, and while the Mate 20 Pro has really improved on this aspect, there are times where the pictures are slightly overexposed. The color tone is correctly done, though, as it is natural, and the dynamic range is great! The shadow details and highlight details are well pronounced on the pictures. HDR also helps to cut down on the exposure at times to help shoot a better “colored” photo.  Talking about the portraits, well, I think Huawei should be doing better work here. The pictures with the portrait mode, images came out with an unnatural cut. It, however, does a good job by identifying all the faces on the picture. But if the depth of field is taken into account, some pictures come out with a good surrounding depth even when you don’t tap on the pictures for focus.      Huawei Mate 20 pro camera samples Portrait images   1  of 2                                      In terms of night time, the Mate 20 Pro does exceptional work in capturing the best of photos. There is ample saturation, details on the pictures, and the contrast and color tone are very natural. You will certainly love taking a stroll with the Mate 20 Pro during night time too.      Huawei-mate-20-pro-night-time-camera-samples   1  of 7                                                                                        There is also a Night Mode on this phone, and while that might sound impressive, the feature has some conditions applied. While the Pixel 3 actually changes night into day with its Nightscape, the Mate 20 Pro’s Night mode only works when there are slight hints of light on the subject. However, when there is no light focusing on the subject, the picture is just dark.   On the front lies a 24MP camera for taking selfies. One thing the Mate 20 Pro has in common with its Samsung compatriots is the selfie. Samsung still has a lot to do with the selfies on its flagships, and the Mate 20 Pro is no different. There are phones from Oppo and Vivo that take a better detailed and better-colored image. So, we can completely skip saying the tech jargons to conclude that the selfie camera is just okay on this phone.      Huawei-Mate-20-pro-selfie-samples   1  of 6                                                                              The video quality is great though. Even with shaky hands, you can expect stabilized videos with this one! The stabilization was again seen in the videos captured during night time. However, there were lots of hints of noise on it.  Check out high-resolution samples  here .  Battery  The battery on this device is large, it’s the largest on 2018’s flagship measuring at 4200 mAh. In comparison, the  iPhone XS Max  has 3174 mAh battery, while the  OnePlus 6T  features a 3700 mAh battery. The Note 9 is the only one that comes close with its 4000 mAh one in place. The most amazing thing about this aspect except for the battery life itself is the fact that Huawei has included such a large battery inside this slim body.   Let’s talk about battery life now. While using the Mate 20 pro on the highest resolution, it battery provided me 6-7 hours of on-screen time. It might look a lot less for a phone with a large battery, but this is the figure that came up during heavy usage. I gamed a lot, went through a lot of applications, and made the phone really work its way! You can easily last for around 6-7 hours with this battery under normal usage. So, if you are looking for great battery life on a flagship smartphone, this is the one you should get.  However, there is this issue most of us have to deal with. Whenever the battery percent touches 2, the phone automatically shuts down, which is a bummer for someone who forgets to keep track of the battery life.  On the brighter side, this battery is backed up by Huawei’s Super Charge 40W technology that charged up from 0 to 100 % in just around an hour. So, apart from Oppo R17’s Super VOOC charge, this is the fastest you can get right now.  Extras  The final aspect to be covering here is the extras. Now, this might not sound like a major piece of a smartphone, but we have gotten to a point where they can actually make or break a smartphone.   The Huawei Mate 20 Pro has an under-display fingerprint scanner that’s fast. Now, there are times when it didn’t read my print 100% of the time, but over time, it can get faster. Huawei also has its dual user feature which can be triggered through two different fingerprints.  In front lies the 3D face unlock which Huawei claims is among the most accurate. To make it that accurate, Huawei has the infrared camera and a flood illuminator on the notch of the device. While it is definitely accurate, this sensor takes some time before unlocking the phone. The pause is minimum, but you do notice it.  The phone is IP68 just liked its competitors, so you can definitely use it for some underwater pictures.  The reverse charging on this device sounds quite impressive. No, it won’t come in use most of the times, but during emergencies, you will be able to offer help to your friends letting them charge their dying phones.\xa0 It works 100% of the times, and kudos to Huawei for this innovation. But this charging is very, very slow then you expect. It’s even slower than any charger you pick up from a store. So, it will take a lot of time before Huawei actually gets this right.   The speaker on this phone is great as well. I have liked watching movies on this stereo setup. If you look closely, there are no speaker grills on the bottom of the phone. This is because Huawei has placed the speaker inside the USB C port. Yes, the audio actually plays from inside the port. But the sound isn’t as loud as I expected. And when you’re charging the phone there is a slight change in the sound level.  There are some areas where Huawei should have gone with something else. Like the storage. The Mate 20 Pro available in Nepal comes with 128 GB internal memory. For its expansion, it has Huawei’s nano SD card slot which isn’t as popular as the microSD card slot and will cost a lot more than a normal card. And apart from that, it is not available in the Nepali market as well. So, the 128GB variant is the only option you have right now.  Conclusion  The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is an expensive phone. It’s even more expensive than the Note 9 here in Nepal. But this device here packs in a lot more than all the other flagship smartphones offer. It is the innovator of 2018, and will really make a great couple with someone like a business person, or as GSM Arena said, travels a lot. Also, it is a great phone with good cameras. Huawei has done a lot of homework to bring out this beast of a phone and Kudos to Huawei for this!

The  M-series line of smartphones  is expected to launch somewhere at the end of January or early February. There are no words on pricing as of now. But seeing Samsung’s purpose of launching these devices, they should provide real value for money experience.  Consequently, the M-series lineup of smartphones is the answer to Samsung’s losing battle with the Chinese manufacturers in the budget and mid-range segment. This has been a major problem for the Korean based tech giant in terms of popularity and in its sheer shipment volumes.  Samsung Galaxy M10, M20 & M40  In other news, the Samsung M20 has also been spotted going through the FCC certifications. The published documents include a 6.13-inch Infinity V display, Exynos 7885 and a 5000mAh battery.

Mostly, for its flagship prowess for a very aggressive price. And so, there were confusions whether this phone belonged to a mid-range device or a flagship. And honestly, there’s no answer to that. The Pocophone F1 features a flagship processor of 2018, which is the  Snapdragon 845 , and all other things were above average, maybe, except the design.   And despite all its efforts, it still failed to be the number one phone because Xiaomi achieved the price through exclusive deals for retailers, MIUI ads and losses for the startup glory. Nevertheless, it was a smart purchase all around the world. And there were so many queries about the phone before it came to Nepal.        And thanks to Daraz.com.np, the phone made its way here, albeit for a brief period of time. Making its debut in Nepal via\xa0 Daraz 11.11 sales day , the phone was exclusively available in Nepal. And the price was also pretty close to international pricing, around  Rs.35000 .  And so, when it was here, people swept through the online marketplace for the phone. There were initially some problems for acquiring the phone, but it did get to buyer’s hands. And the phone sold pretty quickly. Pre-bookings went through the roof, and Teletalk, which was the body responsible for bringing the phone to Nepal had brought about  2000 pieces . And it appears, all of them have been sold out!  So, despite many of you enquiring about the Pocophone F1, it is now, no longer available in Nepal officially. The Pocophone F1 came and went away with the wind.  And Teletalk has no intentions to restock the Pocophone F1 again. Partly, because there are rumors surfacing about the  Pocophone F2 , so, they might be bringing that one here instead. Of course, that’s all rumors for now, so, let’s wait and see.  However, the Pocophone F1 is not entirely gone. Traces of it remain in the form of some products brought via Grey channels, and some stores around New Road still sell them. There might be some difference in pricing, but if you really want it, then, you’ll have to pay.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pocophone-f1.jpg']

The display follows the same trend with  unnecessary huge bezels  on all four sides. So, until the time you actually turn on the laptop, there is no excitement at all.  The bottom is made up of plastic, with four large rubber padding at the corners. A huge set of air vents to keep the laptop cool. Then, there are two easy access compartments. In the most traditional but a very convenient way, you can access the hard disk or the RAM slots with just one screw each. If you want the whole back panel off you will need to unscrew more screws.   The lid has a huge predator logo on the center with two red lines that run through the lid. At the back, there is a huge exhaust vent, although not all of it is functional; i.e. air flows only through some small openings in the vent. Finally, if we talk numbers, dimensions of the laptop comes in at  15.4″ x 10.5″ x 1.1″  and weights  2.7 Kilograms .  Display  This is where the magic happens, thanks to the  15.6-inch FHD IPS  display with a  144Hz refresh rate . It’s really fast, and you will feel it right from the start. Just moving the cursor around is enough for you to notice the smoothness the super fast screen brings to the table. Once you use this display, any other panel with a traditional 60Hz refresh rate will feel slow.  The panel isn’t bad either. The FHD resolution is pretty much perfect for the GPU. The display also produces pretty accurate colors, covering over  90% of the sRGB color spectrum . It’s great for gaming, while at the same time should not disappoint part-time photo or video editors. I must say, it’s a really nice display, as compared to the competition.   Coming back to the 144Hz, which is pretty much the highlight of this laptop. Yes, the relatively fast panel does add up to the final cost of the laptop but trust me, it’s worth it. Gaming has never been this engaging, everything is just smooth. Especially when a game can utilize the full potential of the display, it’s just awesome.  Performance  As for performance, the  Intel Core i7-8750H  is a great performer. It’s fast, keeps the laptop running fluid and utilizes the GTX 1060 to it’s maximum. It gets  six cores, twelve threads , with a  base clock of 2.2GHz and 4.1GHz on boost . Since we’ve seen this processor a dozen times now, there’s nothing new to say. It’s the best processor for gaming on a laptop at this price range.  Gaming Performance  This is one of the aspects of this laptop that leaves a lot to be desired. The 144Hz panel discussed earlier demands fps! But the hardware inside cannot deliver. If it was a regular laptop with a 60Hz display, the performance could have been pretty great. But the  6 GB GTX 1060  cannot compliment the fast screen that well, and so, there is so much of displayable frames unused. And it just feels like there’s so much potential, but most of it is restricted.   While gaming, the rame rates were pretty high, above 60 on most games we threw at it, at high settings. But to reach that sweet 144Hz threshold, I found myself lowering the graphics quality a lot.  For instance, games like Fifa 19 did run at a healthy 110-120fps. But I still lowered the graphics to around medium to reach somewhere around 150fps. It was an absolute improvement, or maybe it was just me but I felt it was better. The bad graphics quality was really no match for the smooth gameplay.    Acer Predator Helios 300 2018  Infogram  Thermals  One of the main factors that refrained the previous generation Helios 300 from greatness was its thermal performance. It wasn’t bad but it wasn’t par with some other laptops in its competition. This time it’s a bit different as the thermals have noticeably improved. It does heat up, but only after longer loads of time, and keeps the maximum temperature at a controllable rate.  Of course, you can throttle the fans to the maximum, which is around 6000 rpm. The laptop gets very noisy in this mode, but at least it stays cool. Yes, the laptop still throttles, but it’s not as bad as its predecessor. There were a few times when games actually stuttered for two or three seconds, but that was once every half hour or so and didn’t bother me much.  Storage and Battery  This laptop comes with only a  256 GB SSD  with an empty slot to fit a 2.5″ hard drive. Read speeds maxed out at around  1575 MBPS  and write speeds of around  597 MBPS . If you want more storage you can just add a hard drive, and the M.2 SSD itself is easily replaceable. At these speeds, you probably won’t be upgrading, but just for the record, you can.   As for battery life, this laptop get is a puny  48Wh  battery, which by the numbers, isn’t enough. Paired with a six-core processor, a GTX 1060 and that 144Hz display, I barely got around  3 hours of light usage . If you wanna game on battery, don’t expect anything over an hour. We could call this a bad battery performance, but well, it’s just how gaming laptops are.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The keyboard isn’t actually bad, it’s just soft. Depending on your preference, some might like it, most will definitely hate it. The key travel was fine, but it just doesn’t give you that satisfying feedback. It’s a mushy keyboard, and there is no going around that. It has backlighting, but only RED. If the Red looks intrusive, you have no choice but to turn it off. But the keyboard is of high quality and should last you until the end of your laptop’s lifetime.  The other thing I have to complain about is the placement of the keys itself. The power button is just another key right beside the ‘End’ key and that, for some reason felt like a fake power button. MacBooks, despite the same keyboard layout, do these types of power buttons pretty well, but it is just poorly implemented on this one. The arrow keys were also a bit problematic, nothing you cannot get used to though.   The trackpad isn’t really good, however. It uses Windows Precision drivers and the gestures worked fine, but the tracking seemed so out of place. You would probably want to buy an external mouse for daily usage. Then again, you probably were going to anyway, since gaming with a trackpad is not normal.  Connectivity  Connectivity wise, the laptop has a lot in store. Starting off with the USB-C port that doesn’t support ThunderBolt 3, the only downside as long as connectivity is concerned. It’s not exactly a deal breaker but that could have been a great addition.  It gets the  Intel 9560ac Wi-Fi , which is also replaceable while the  Bluetooth 4.0  module is built in. There is a 720p webcam up top which up on par with other laptops, and by that, I mean very average. The laptop charges via a 180-watt charger, and finally the laptop houses two dual speakers which produce clear and loud audio but lacks bass.    As for port selection, you get a  Kensington lock ,  Ethernet port, HDMI, USB-C , and an  SD card reader \xa0on the left. On the right\xa0resides one  USB Type A port , a  headphone jack , and a  charging port . So, you can clearly see there have been no compromises made on the selection of ports.  Conclusion  You now know almost everything you need to know about the laptop. It’s a good performer, has a fast display, not that heavy or thick, has good thermal performance, looks nice, and is built well. Also, it costs right between other laptops like  Dell G7  or the  HP Omen 15T , that are pretty priced in the same bracket, flaunts similar internals but don’t feature a 144Hz display.  You probably know by now that this laptop can impress you a lot. For  Rs. 1,65,000 , you are getting so much, to begin with. But if they could have improved the thermals just a little, this laptop would have been just perfect. For now, let’s just call this a real value for money, or a bang for your buck! And given that your budget fits the asking price of this laptop, you won’t regret buying the Acer Predator Helios 300 2018.  Acer Predator Helios 300 2018 Nutshell      Pros  Cons    Display  Trackpad    Performance  Thermals could have been even better    Build and Design  No RGB    Gaming Performance  Battery Life    Value for Money  Keyboard    Connectivity  No ThunderBolt Support']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300.jpg']

['ASUS ROG Strix Hero II Review – Is it Hero enough?'],"['Asus', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['December 31, 2018']",2018-12-31 08:18:26+00:00,"['With faster screens appealing to the masses more and more, gaming laptops these days really try to integrate one in their devices. And why not? A good gaming laptop does not mean only unparalleled performance but good visuals and sounds as well. The ASUS ROG Strix Hero II is one such laptop with a super-fast screen and great audio. But what else does it pack?   ASUS ROG Strix Hero II Specifications:   Design and Build: \xa0Metal lid, plastic body, 36.1 x 26.2 x 2.61 cm, 2.4 kg  Display: \xa015.6″ Full HD (1920 x 1080), 93% sRGB & 70% Adobe RGB, 72% NTSC Color Gamut, 320 nits peak brightness with Anti-Glare  Keyboard:\xa0 ASUS Aura RGB Gaming Keyboard, RGB backlighting, 1.4 mm key travel  Processor: \xa0Hexa-core 8 th \xa0gen i7-8750H processor, Base-Clock @ 2.2 GHz, Turbo Boost Clock up to 4.1 GHz  RAM: \xa0DDR4 16 GB (2x slots, upgradeable up to 32 GB)  Graphics: \xa06 GB NVidia GeForce GTX 1060  Battery: \xa04-cell 66 Watt-hours (up to 3 hours of backup)  Adapter:\xa0 180 Watts  Storage: \xa0256 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD + 1 TB FireCuda SSHD  Webcam:\xa0 720p Webcam  Connectivity: \xa0802.11 ac Gigabit Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v5.0  Ports:\xa0 3 x\xa0USB A 3.1, 1 x USB-C (No Thunderbolt 3 support), 1 x 3.5 mm headphone jack, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Mini-display, 1 x RJ-45 Ethernet,\xa01 x SDcard slot  Price: \xa0Rs.210,000 ($1550 international)    Buy ASUS ROG Strix Hero II here  Design  The design of the laptop is pretty clever! It is something that you won’t see every day.         The whole laptop chassis has a  square boxed design , and it’s a bit different than what we are used to seeing on others. It looks pretty cool, with a striking factor about how it looks. I’d describe it as elegant and futuristic. The laptop is not very slim for but it still maintains a small form factor even for a 15.6” laptop. It  weighs 2.4 kg  without the charger, which is okay, for a gaming laptop.   The outer lid is made of aluminum with brushed texture and ROG logo on the side. The logo glows, and can switch colors, which of course, is programmable just like the keyboard lighting inside. You get a two-tone design on the lid with a slash. One half is hairline brushed while the other is anodized. The lid also is designed to reveal the notification LEDs when closed too.   There’s also a light-strip up front, which seems a bit pointless. But of course, some might like it. The  build of the laptop is plastic . But it does appear sturdy to look and feel and there’s no flex when pressed whatsoever. A metal build all over would definitely have been better, but it’s not. Still, it has a pretty great feel and heft, there’s not much to complain about.   The air vents are at the back and there’s also one on the right side. Also, these vents at the back are also cleverly designed to keep the laptop cool while also preventing accumulating dust. The design is the most appealing factor. Its sharp, arcane and stands out.  Display   On the display front, the laptop has a  15.6” Full HD panel  with a  144 Hz refresh rate  and  3 milliseconds of response time . That makes it another of the few laptops with one of the fastest screens on the market which is great for gaming.  MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games  tend to be very fast paced and screen like these are a treat.   The 144 Hz refresh rate certainly helps push out a good number of frames per second, and 3 milliseconds of response time make your actions look very fluid. Also, the bezels around the display are pretty thin, making it look great. But that leads to this awkwardly placed webcam down on the right.   The overall screen is smooth and the picture quality is fantastic! The picture quality is crisp, colors pop out everywhere, details look amazing and there’s nothing to complain about the image & video quality.  The brightness is about  320 nits , which is good enough too. The color accuracy is not bad with  93% standard RGB ,  72% NTSC Color Gamut Coverage  and  70% Adobe RGB . This works very well for gaming, but if you’re into editing stuff, there are better options out there.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The keyboard layout is somewhat different than other gaming laptops. It also features some additional hot keys for volume, microphone and the ROG Gaming Centre, which can help you take some quick actions in the middle of the game. This is a nice additional feature to have. But the position of the arrow keys seems a bit off, and it’s easy to confuse them most of the time.   The feedback from the  chiclet keyboard  is very good. You also get soft “clicky” sounds which can be pretty satisfying. There’s about  1.4 mm of key travel , and that is good enough for me.  The backlighting is not too harsh either and looks good nonetheless. The one thing that differentiates this ASUS ROG Strix Hero II from the Scar II is the highlighted keys. The Scar II has W-A-S-D transparent while this has  Q-W-E-R . Which means that this laptop is meant for MOBA gamers while the Scar II is for those who’re into First Person Shooters.  The backlighting has various modes and can be customized but it is not as comprehensive as the  MSI GE63 Raider RGB’ s. But yes, it is a simple yet good keyboard.  The trackpad is also very nice. With  Windows Precision Drivers , it tracks really well and the gestures are solid. The  dedicated hardware buttons  are nice as well, and even though you might have a mouse plugged in most of the time, the touchpad is really good.  Performance  In the power side of things, it features the latest  Hexa-core 8 th -gen Intel i7-8750H processor , coupled with  16 GB RAM  at  2666 MHz frequency . And the performance is as expected. You can fly through multi-tasking nicely. You can have as many things running on the background as you want, and no app seems to be heavy enough to over-work it.  As for benchmarks,  Cinbench 15  scores  174 points for single-core performance  whereas  1203 for multi-core performance .   Gaming on this machine is pretty good too. It features the  Nvidia GTX 1060  with  6 GB of Video Memory . And while that is a pretty solid performer, it feels somewhat inadequate to compliment the super-fast screen all that well. In our gaming tests, highly graphic intensive games like PUBG resulted in about 40 frames per second on maximum settings and about 50 on low. CS:GO displayed 60 in highest settings, about 80 on medium and 90 on high settings, on average.  But the beauty of the screen is reflected in MOBA games like Dota 2 and Paladin’s. Paladin’s on Ultra Settings averages on 80 frames per second. But there’s always so much going on in the game, yet the screen captures every moment without a hitch. The same goes for Dota 2 as well.  Yet I cannot help but wonder, if, maybe, this had a GTX 1070 in it, you’d get better frames. But the 1060 does a good job too.  Also, you have this  ROG Gaming Center  that looks something straight out of a Sci-Fi movie. This helps you regulate various settings for the games like change fan settings. It also gives you System information about core temperatures and memory used. But it is a bit complex to use, and it can take some time to get used to.  Thermals  As for thermals, they’re pretty good too. The max inner temperatures can go to  75 and 78 for CPU and GPU respectively . But there is no throttling.  You have three fan modes: Silent, Balanced and Over Boost. The laptop has  HyperCool Pro thermal system  with  dual 12V fans ,  triple radiators  and a  heatsink , which do a fairly good job of keeping the laptop cool and without throttling.  \xa0 Storage  Storage wise, there is a  256 GB M.2 NVMe PCI SSD , and a  1 TB FireCuda SSHD  as well. So, for storage, you’re well sorted. On our tests, the SSD gave us about  1570 MB/s of read speeds  and  870 MB/s of write speeds .  The SSHD is different that your regular HDD. These drives have a small amount of SSD built-in like a cache memory and stores your most important files on the SSD part, so that you have better access to it.  Ports   As for ports, you get enough of them as well. On the left, there is a  power jack , an  RJ45 Ethernet port , a  mini Display port , an  HDMI 2.0 port ,  two USB A’s , a  USB Type-C  (without Thunderbolt 3 support) and an  Audio-jack .   The right side has a Kensington lock slot, another  USB A  and an  SD-card reader .  Battery  The battery is the part where gaming laptops tend to struggle. And this one is no different. It has a  4-cell 66 Watt-hour battery . And it lasted merely  2.5 hours on normal usage  and about  50 minutes while gaming .  But I think that was a problem with my unit. As it is a 66 Whr battery, which should give us more battery life. But nevertheless, you definitely need to carry around a charger with you, as it won’t last a whole day.  Conclusion  So, all in all, the ASUS ROG Strix Hero II is a good gaming machine. If you get this, you’ll have something that catches your eye, one of the fastest screen for a laptop, and also great sound quality.  To talk about the bad aspects of the laptop, you have a  bad web-cam in a bad position . The quality is muddy, and noisy and just not good at all. Plus, the awkward position makes it worse. Also, there are  2 RAM slots  if you want to upgrade the laptop but it has  12 screws underneath  and is a bit difficult to open up. In addition, there’s  no Thunderbolt 3 support .   This laptop is priced at  $1550  or  Rs.210000 , here in Nepal. And the problem with that is, it seems a bit expensive for a GTX 1060. I, personally, would be a bit reluctant to pay that much for a GTX 1060. And there are other laptops in a similar price range with better performance. If it had a 1070, it would, hands down, be the best laptop at this price.  You also get the  Acer Predator Helios 300 2018  with the same specs and screen that one costs a lot less at Rs.165000. If you don’t really care about the aesthetics, that can be a better choice. But for the extra cost, you get a better keyboard, better sound quality, better design and build too. So, it’s up to you.  Pros:   Great Design and build  Great Display with Super-fast screen  Good performance  Good thermals   Cons:   Poor battery life  Bad webcam quality and placement  GTX 1060 for the price']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/asus-rog-strix-hero-ii-review.jpg']
['Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro Review: Really an upgrade over Note 5 AI?'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Xiaomi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['December 31, 2018']",2018-12-31 05:39:59+00:00,"['Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI  or the Redmi Note 5 Pro was one of the best value for money smartphones especially when it comes to the lower midrange price. And because of the same reason, I did recommend the device to our followers in a number of occasions as well. Recently, Xiaomi launched the successor of the device. But how much of an upgrade has the Redmi Note 6 Pro brought on the table? And can it fill the shoes of its predecessor? Let’s find out in Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro Review.  Camera  Let’s start with the camera. The camera is the biggest highlight of the phone and the presence of quad-camera setup readily cues that. The phone comes with a dual camera setup at the back and there are other two on the front.   The rear camera is aligned vertically in an iPhone XS style with LED flash in between. The camera duo at the back comprises of 12MP and 5MP sensor and the hardware setup is similar to that on the Redmi Note 5 AI. Despite the similarities on the hardware, you can see significant improvements on the Note 6 Pro when it comes to capturing the images. The images captured from the Note 6 Pro looks vibrant and colors seem to pop out more. A photography geek would find it to be slightly oversaturated; however, it looks way better than the undersaturated images from the Note 5 AI.        Details are well-preserved and color accuracy is also slightly better on the Note 6 Pro. I didn’t notice any sort of any sort of focusing issues either. All thanks to the Dual-pixel Phase Detection Autofocus on the phone.        1  of 6                                                                              Dynamic range is decent and you can enhance the dynamic shots by turning on the HDR mode. The HDR mode doesn’t overprocess here, though it pulls out some details in the shadows keeping the overall sharpness of the image intact. It is not the best I have seen from a midranger, but considering the price, the job it did was respectable.        1  of 2               HDR Off         HDR On                  The phone also has an AI mode, which detects the object in focus and the AI is said to do some processing to make it look better. However, I did not notice any significant differences.        1  of 4               AI Mode Off         AI Mode On         AI Mode Off         AI Mode On                        And when it comes to the lowlight images, the captured images tend to lose some details. And the noises and grains are also quite noticeable. However, it did a better than the Note 5 AI. It feels really good to see this sort of improvements.        1  of 3                                                Since there are two cameras, you can capture portrait images as well. The edge detection capabilities have considerably improved from the Note 5 AI. And this time, the amount of blur on the background looks more natural. So I was satisfied with the portrait images captured from the device.        1  of 3                                                Now let’s move on to the selfie part. And even for the selfies, Xiaomi has packed two cameras on the front. Well, the 20MP primary camera does most of the job here and the secondary 2MP camera just gathers depth information of the subject. So with both the cameras in action, you can capture portrait selfies as well. And portrait selfies looks remarkable with proper edge detection and the\xa0right amount of blur intensity.\xa0Normal selfies also look good in a similar fashion so there is nothing much to complain here too.        1  of 5               Normal Selfie         Normal selfie         Low Light Portrait selfie         Low light selfie         Portrait Selfie                           But the sad part is, the phone can only shoot videos in 1080p and 30fos at maximum. So you won’t be able to capture 4k videos. But even at the Full-HD resolution, Note 6 Pro does a great job. Colors look true to life, focusing is great, and the video contains a decent amount of details. And the good thing here is the presence of  Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) . The EIS does a great job on suppressing the shakes and vibration on the videos. And I must praise the Note 6 Pro here as the videos captured from it are better than that from most of the midrangers available at a similar price.  For high-quality images,  Click here .  Display  On the display front, the Redmi Note 6 is slightly bigger than its predecessor. Xiaomi stretched the screen from 6-inch\xa0on the Note 5 AI to 6.26-inch on the Note 6 Pro without increasing the size of the phone. So, you can already guess, it has a higher screen to body ratio.   The bezels and chin have been slashed significantly. But to increase the screen to body ratio, Xiaomi this time implemented a notch on the top. And this is one of the very noticeable differences between the Note 5 AI and Note 6 Pro. Although this\xa0created a slight bump in the screen to body ratio, the notch looks really ugly in this device and is annoying at the same time. Xiaomi could have implemented a teardrop/dew-drop style of notch like that on the  Vivo V11  and the  Oppo F9  but that’s not the case here. If you hate the notch on this device, you can also hide it with a black bar on the top. But since the display on this device is an IPS panel and not an AMOLED one, hiding the notch with the black bar won’t save you any battery juice.  And continuing with the display, Redmi Note 6 Pro features Full-HD+ resolution and this time with a 19:9 aspect ratio. At a pixel density of 403PPI, the contents on the screen look really sharp. And talking about color accuracy, it is decent enough considering the price. But when it comes to the color temperature of the display, I notice the display being slightly deviated to a warmer tone. The phone also has a color wheel to adjust the color temperature of the screen, however, I couldn’t exactly obtain the balanced color temperature. So, you have to live with that!   In terms of brightness, the screen glows with the maximum brightness of 480 nits, which is slightly lower than 530 nits brightness on the Redmi Note 5 AI. Nevertheless, the screen is legible even on the outdoors, which is the good part. You won’t face any issues even while viewing contents on the broad daylight. And since there is an ambient light sensor to adjust the display brightness according to the light of the surroundings, there won’t be any hassles on adjusting the display brightness every now and then. So, kudos to Xiaomi!  Redmi Note 6 Pro also has a notification LED on the top. But just like its predecessor, the LED blinks white and the color is non-adjustable. The LED is also dim when it comes to the brightness so you can’t see the blinking LED at times even when you are just a few feet away. I think Xiaomi should really give thoughts on bringing bright and colorful notification LED from next time around.  Design & Build  On the design side, you won’t see anything new and innovative here. Xiaomi implemented the same old-school design with metallic body capped with plastic material on the top and on the bottom. But this time, even the frame is plastic, which may invite reliability issue over time. Since other smartphone OEMs are incorporating premium plastic or glass back on their phone, I think, Xiaomi should also start implementing some modern design language.   Nonetheless, the device looks sturdy and feels decently premium on the hold. Although the device weighs 182 grams, the weight is evenly distributed throughout its body so it does not feel hefty especially when it’s on the hand. So I didn’t face any discomfort even while using the device.  Performance  Note 6 Pro launched nearly nine months after the launch of the Note 5 Pro. But there is barely any upgrade on the performance front. Just like its predecessor, the Note 6 pro comes with Snapdragon 636 chipset packing 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage on its sleeve. So, as you would expect, there were hardly any differences while running any app or game and multitasking between them. After nine months, we definitely expect an upgrade right? Well, you are not getting that here.   Nonetheless, the Snapdragon 636 is a decent chipset and handles most of the day to day tasks without a fuss. I played Asphalt 9 and also ran PUBG in the medium settings. And while playing the games, I did not notice any major lags and stutters. But occasionally, you will notice a slight drop in frame rates. If only Xiaomi had opted for  Snapdragon 660  or the  MediaTek Helio P60 , there would have been fewer such issues. Well, we should probably have to wait for the Redmi 7 Pro to really get that sort of upgrade.   Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro  Infogram  Software  On the software side, the phone comes with an Android Oreo 8.1 with MIUI 9.5 out of the box. The MIUI 9.5 was heavy and cluttered. But I didn’t have to spend much time with that cluttered UI. Shortly after I got the handset for the review, the phone received MIUI 10.0.5 update. The new MIUI is much more polished and much more optimized than the 9.5. So users will surely enjoy using the device with new UI. However, ads appear here and there in the UI, which results in the bitter user experience. I turned off every setting related to the ads on the UI but still, it didn’t stop.   When people spend their hard-earned money on a new device, they expect a clean and delightful user experience. Come on Xiaomi, please don’t take that away from your users. Also, there are tons of bloatware, which I did not find myself using much. And the sad part is most of them cannot be uninstalled or disabled.  But except for the presence of bloatware and Ads issue, there is plenty of reasons to like about the new MIUI. In the new UI, what I liked the most is the gesture mode. You can replace the on-screen buttons with the finger gestures. Swiping up quickly minimizes the apps and brings the home screen, swiping up and pausing for a while shows the recent apps and swiping to the right let the user go back in the menu. Although the device is fun to use by navigating with the gestures, it took quite a while for me to get accustomed with this feature.  Security  On the security side of things, you get a fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock feature as a biometric authentication tool. The fingerprint sensor was fast and accurate. So I was duly pleased with it. However, Face Unlock feature is not easily accessible for all the users.   The feature is limited to some specific regions only. I didn’t try and test every available location to confirm if the service is available in that region. However, I would like you to know that it wasn’t available when I set the region to Nepal but the feature popped up when I set the region to India. It was a similar case even on the Redmi Note 5 AI. So I couldn’t quite understand why Xiaomi is doing this type of discrimination to its users.  Battery  Providing bigger batteries is one of the biggest traits of  Xiaomi smartphones . And this time, it is no different. It comes with a huge 4000mAh battery to inject the power juice to the phone. With the massive battery on the board, the phone is capable of providing a prolonged backup as well. The handset provided me a remarkable 8.5 hours of screen on time. On the normal use, a fully charged Note 6 Pro can last for nearly two days.   Although the battery backup on the phone fairly pleased me, the presence of the MicroUSB 2.0 port didn’t impress me at all. Also, charging the device was a pain in the neck. This time too, Xiaomi has included a 10-watt adapter, which is quite a sluggish performer, when it comes to the charging the device. When I used the stock charger, it took nearly around half an hour to charge the handset from 0 to 30%. And I had wait for around two and half hour till the device get fully charged. Although Xiaomi claims that the device supports Quick Charge 3.0, you won’t get a fast charger on the box. So if you want to accelerate the charging speed, you should have to buy a separate fast charger.  Conclusion  To sum it up, the Note 6 Pro is a great device and I am not denying it. Although it brought some subtle upgrades over the Note 5 AI, I don’t think the device is worth all the price it’s asking at the moment. You can get better alternatives at a similar price . ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 ,  Realme 2 Pro , and  Honor 8x  would be the quick examples.  Even in Nepal, just by adding a couple of thousands, you can get the  Huawei Y9 2019  and the  Xiaomi MI A2 , which are a great performer on both camera and gaming front. And if you can push the budget further, you can also buy the Pocophone F1. The Pocophone packs a flagship-grade processor, better battery backup, and even the cameras are great than the Note 6 Pro. So as of now, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is no go from my side.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review.jpg']

Apart from Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and the mainstream ones… Besides these, there aren’t probably many apps that you use. But if you are looking for some good apps to explore, you’ve come to the right place. This is our pick of the  Best Android Apps for 2018 .  Actually, not all of these apps are from 2018. This list contains much older apps as well, but are still relevant and popular today. And all of them are free Android apps. Some are fun, while some are just generally useful. So, here they are:  1) Snapseed     This might not be new to you at all. This app made debut  back in 2012 , and to this day, it still remains one of the best photo editing apps for your phone. While you can get apps like Photoshop and Lightroom as well, they’re very comprehensive. And this one, is simple and  pretty easy to use , which is one of its best features. The app features  29 tools and filters  to apply on your phone, and are easily accessible.        The only difficulty you might have is the number of overwhelming options inside each tool. But of course, there is an  Auto Adjustment feature  for each one which makes your job easier. In addition, it also saves your recent preferences for you to use in your next edit.  Due to all of this, this age old app is still on our list of Best apps of 2018.   DOWNLOAD  2) Bored Button     If you tend to play a lot of games on your phone, then, this one is for you. Downloading a lot of games can be quite tedious, and occupy a lot of space on your device. But with this, you get a whole lot of games within a single app. And the app works just like its name. You have a button which you press if you get bored playing the game over and over. And then, you’re welcomed with a new game! Every time you press the button, there’s a new game waiting for you. But the catch is that only works when you have an internet connection.  There’s also an option to  save any game for offline  if you like it. You get games of various genres – from arcade to puzzle games, and you’ll be shown games based on your preferences. But if you’re into graphic intensive games like Asphalt and PUBG, this may not be for you. It is an app that satisfies your wandering mind.   DOWNLOAD  3) Alarmy     An alarm app that is quite popular…sounds strange? Well, yes, but you have to give it to the creators. This app was also  introduced back in 2012 . It’s an app that will wake you up no matter what. For those who can’t seem to get up in the morning, this app features super annoying loud alarms that have to be turned off with quite the effort.  You can choose how to turn your alarm while setting it up. By default, you can choose to  solve math problems . But a fun feature is that there is also an option for you to turn off your alarm by  taking a picture of something . For instance, if you choose your bathroom, you have to get up and take a picture of your bathroom to turn the alarm off every time. All of that makes it super annoying, and ensures you get up, but that is the whole purpose of an alarm, isn’t it?   DOWNLOAD  4) Shortly     This one is for you readers out there…those who love to read. More so, for those who love to read but can’t seem to find the time to go through long stories or entire books. And just like its name, the app lets you read short articles – mostly stories, but also some essays and monologues from various writers. That’s the whole point of the app, but that is the best part.  When you open the app, you can  choose between 1 minute, 3 minute or 5 minute reads , depending on the amount of time you have. When you pick one and finish, you can click the next button to immediately begin reading another story of similar length. There is also an option to share the story through your social media handles, but the recipient also needs to have the app to read it though. There are options to change the theme colors as well. It is a very simple app, but one that is difficult to put down once you get started with it.   DOWNLOAD  5) StopAd     This is an that does what it’s name says –  stops advertisements in your online viewing experience . Well, it does not block all kinds of ads that you get, but mostly pop-ups and ad-links, and also other elements like images as well. This can be helpful while browsing on data. The app  also “blocks” ads on YouTube  in the sense that it blocks the ads with its own logo until you can skip them.  Also, while it is turned on, it uses its own VPN. Hence, it  protects you from malware and your privacy  as well. It  blocks   Ad trackers  as well as Social Media trackers to keep your browsing behavior and social media behavior private. There is also a paid version which can also help against Phishing and Malware attacks. So, it is a ad-blocker and a small-scale security app as well.

Well, technically, it is under Mi-series. But this series is similar to the Redmi series in terms of affordability for the Mi lineup. So, it will be affordable, but will be less powerful than the other Mi phones.   Xiaomi Mi Play Overview   The Mi Play has the modern 2018 looks with thin bezels and the water-drop / tear-drop notch at front. That’s actually a first for any Xiaomi phone so far. Also, this phone has a glass body –  Gorilla Glass on both sides  of the phone. The back has two-tone colors, very similar to the  Huawei Nova 3i . Seems like that design is really getting popular, huh?   The display is a  5.84″ IPS LCD with Full HD+ resolution  in 19:9 aspect ratio. Like any other phone of 2018, this one has a dual camera setup as well. This phone packs a  12 MP primary sensor  with a  2 MP depth sensor . On the front, you will see an  8 MP selfie shooter , which also serves as Face Recognition mechanism.         Inside, you have the new  octa-core Helio P35 , which is also, a new chipset, and comparable to the likes of Snapdragon 632. The chipset is combined with  4 GB of RAM , to give you a good enough performance for a budget phone. It also has a  64 GB of internal storage . Also it packs a  3000 mAh battery . But the major downside is that it still features a  microUSB port  while  ditching the headphone jack .   Price and Availability  The phone was launched in China on December 25th.

However, this year, the Korean Giant promised to roll out Android Pie (v9.0) update on the  Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus  in January next year. That itself was a good thing, but to our surprise, Samsung has already started rolling out the Android Pie update to the two smartphones.  Users from various countries and regions have reported receiving the latest from Google. So, it could be only a matter of time before the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus users from Nepal get to experience Android Pie on the devices.     With this update, the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus will also feature One UI as Android Pie has ditched the company’s Experience UI for a faster and user-friendly UI.        The update file is itself a pretty large measuring at 1744.24 MB. The Android Pie upgrade also brings in various updates to the system and applications residing on the device.  Apart from One UI and Android Pie features, the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus will also come with a wide range of other improvements. They will now need just an HDMI cable for DeX while Bixby has some of the latest features. Likewise, the Camera will intelligently detect the scenario to apply the perfect settings. There are also other new and improved features which you can view in the changelog below.   The new update makes Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus the first smartphones from Samsung to receive Android v9.0 Pie update.

['The best laptops of 2018'],[],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['December 24, 2018']",2018-12-24 10:31:19+00:00,"['Choosing a laptop is a lot harder than choosing a smartphone. Everyone could just get an iPhone and be done with it if the price wasn’t a factor. But for a laptop, you will still need to look at your needs and what you plan to do with it.   What’s more confusing is there is no laptop that’s just perfect or the best. Most might blame all the RnD that goes into laptops, which is a lot less than compared to smartphone technologies. So, to make it easy for you let’s look at the best laptops in every category. Or at least all of the once we can think of.  The portable guy – Dell XPS 13  Yes, the  Dell XPS 13  is the best out there if you want a light and portable, yet a capable laptop. It gets decent specs, but what matter’s more is that form factor. The laptop barely weights a kilogram. It also packs a 13″ display on a 12″ form factor while built like a tank.          Highlighted features include great battery life, a stunning display (or a decent one if you choose FHD), and ThunderBolt 3 support. Finally, considering the design, this laptop spares nothing to complain about. The laptop starts at  $949  for the base model configurable up to $1,900.  The Editor’s Choice – MacBook Pro  By editing we mean actual editing of photos, videos, or even music, this one is where it’s all at. Starting off with the display,  MacBook Pro 2018  probably has one of the best panels in the business. The performance is also something no one is going to complain about and with MacOS it’s just better.   That is if you like MacOS, which includes Final Cut Pro X to edit all your vlogs. It gets a super fast SSD, up to 4TB of really really fast storage. The dedicated GPU options are also pretty decent as well. Prices start at  $2,399 , and who knows how much the highest specs model costs.   The Knowledge collector – Microsoft Surface Go  If you are a student, I will just assume you are broke and have very less money to spend. But the pursuit of knowledge should not be limited by your bank account and Microsoft knows it best. The  Microsoft Surface Go  starts at a staggering $399, which can be considered cheap but not substandard.   If you are an actual student, you also get special discounts on the product. As for the features don’t expect much, it’s get’s a detachable keyboard and a workable processor. Storage options are also not that exciting, while the display is just 10-inches. On the upside battery life and portability is great.  For  $399  however, you are basically get nothing. It’s still usable but you will need to shell out a bit more for a type cover. It gets a touch display, so you can probably live without a keyboard until you can save up for one later. Did I mention the Surface Pen support? Sold separately of course.   Is that a tablet? – Apple iPad Pro 2018  No, it’s not a tablet, it’s an  iPad Pro 2018 , with even smaller bezels and a keyboard. Most people might feel that an iPad just isn’t enough to replace a laptop, and we agree. But it also very much depends on what type of a person you are.    I can see a lot of people who would benefit from an iPad rather than a laptop. If all you are buying a laptop for is emails, media consumption, creating presentations, or just editing docs, then by all means. But the main reason could be the ease of use.  Apple has been heavily marketing it as a laptop replacement. Rightfully so, they are a lot faster than most laptops with a better display. They are also a lot simpler and saves so much time off of troubleshooting. Just think of what you need a laptop for before you spend that  $799  or more.   The LAN party expert – Gigabyte Aero 15  We all have that group of friends that meet once every week for a night of drinking and gaming. If you are in one of those groups, well you might have faced one severe problem, taking your gaming rig to your friend’s house. A desktop is out of the question, a bulky Alienware just seems stupid and a Razer Blade stealth is, well it’s the desktop problem all over again.    Answer? The Gigabyte Aero 15, the perfect blend of portability and power. It gets great internals as one gaming laptop should. Add a 144Hz display to the equation and judging by the types of games you will be playing at a LAN party, you will land at an advantage more often than not.   Plus, since it’s a LAN party, a dedicated LAN port never hurt anyone. This laptop also has a relatively big battery too. The only problem you might face is its availability and after sales service. Pricing starts at around  $1600  for models with Intel’s 8th Gen CPUs.  The best of both worlds: Razer Blade Stealth 2018  Gaming laptops aren’t always huge and bulky. Sometimes, they come in a small, thin & portable package, and the  Razer Blade Stealth  is just that. The 2018 version just improves on it more making it a more complete package.  The recently released model gets the latest gen specs as well as a design overhaul. The laptop is a bit pricey but you are getting native support for external GPUs which unlocks all of its gaming capabilities. The laptop gets a four core i7-8565U processor which, in theory, should handle up to a GTX 1060 without bottlenecks.   The other compelling factor is the design, with its new boxy design update, the same as on all other 2018 Razer laptops. But what’s even more impressive is it’s a lot more stealthy now, “office-friendly” if you can call it that.  The delightful design-overhaul means people can use it for gaming and take it to office presentations without a second thought. Gone are the days when you had to cover up that green three-headed snake, those unbearable display bezels, and it’s just so uninspiring curved edges. This is the new Razer Blade Stealth and it starts at  $1,399.99 .   60fps? PFF!! – Alienware 17  Believe it or not, there are people who don’t think 60fps is enough. They live for higher refresh rates and anything over 7ms is a joke. You guys are probably better off with a desktop but if you want a laptop, the  Alienware 17  should do you justice.   The name should be enough for anyone who wants an overkill sort-of portable gaming machine. But let’s jump into the specs. Starting things off with an 8th Gen Core i9-8950HK processor, this beast of a laptop does 4.8GHz on a laptop, with room for overclocking.    With an overclockable Nvidia GTX 1080 with 8GB of GDDR5X GPU, the laptop is a metaphorical beast. The display includes a 4k 17-inch panel with G-Sync enabled and low latency figures. This laptop comes with a maximum of 32GB of dual channel memory.  As for storage, you get three storage devices, two PCIe SSD slots and one spinning hard drive. Add a Killer 1550 Wi-Fi card and RGB lighting sprinkled everywhere you are just ready for gaming. Few final touches include a great selection of I/O, including a proprietary external GPU.  Equipped with a battery that barely fits the legal flying norms, you still can’t expect decent battery life form this one. Finally, it also gets the Tobi Eye tracking feature, probably a gimmick but hey, we get it. A fully specs out version of this laptop will cost you just under  $6000 .  The Jack of all trades – Dell XPS 15  No matter if you are a designer, editor, light-weight gamer or just an average user who just wants to Netflix and chill, the  Dell XPS 15  can do it all. It features one of the best display in the market, the performance is nothing to complain about, and it’s built like it could take a beating.    The GTX 1050 Ti is a great graphics card but if you are a more serious gamer, you might want to look at something with a better thermal performance. But that’s the only thing this XPS falls at, apart from that it leaves nothing to be desired.  If you do not fall under any of the above categories, then this is it, granted you have the budget. The XPS 15 does everything well, for a price. It starts at  $999  for the most basic configuration, but if you can splash in the cash, you are definitely in for a great experience. There is an option for an XPS 15 with a 360-degree high if you are into that as well.   The budget-conscious – Acer Aspire 3  If you look at all of the laptops in this list till now, most of them are pretty expensive. Apart from the one for students, most are pretty much at the top of their game, and for good reasons too, if you choose the one for your needs, you won’t be regreting much. But since we are considering all of the categories, it would have been incomplete without a budget laptop.  While the word “budget” means different to different people, we will look at one that you can buy just under  $400 . That’s the Acer Aspire 3, with it’s 8th Gen Core i3 processor, a full 1TB hard drive, 6GB of DDR3 RAM and a 15.6″ FHD display. This laptop is one of the best laptops you can buy for a lot of reasons other than the specs.    For a budget conscious buyer, you will be looking at good specs for sure, but reliability matters as well. Since it’s an Acer laptop it’s service centers should be available, in the  vaugest  terms, everywhere. M ost  of my friends own this laptop and they have never had any problems with it.  That might sound like an obvious statement but I have heard most of my colleagues complain about their XPS more than I have heard about this laptop. The display is also pretty great since you are getting an FHD panel. So, if you want a laptop on a budget that actually performs decent and is reliable to an extent, well this is it.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/best-laptops-of-2018.jpg']

And Samsung was  revamping its A-series  with mid-range and low-end smartphones too, but the phone that’s coming up is to sport a flagship processor.    Yes, that’s right. The Galaxy A10 will sport the  Snapdragon 845 chipset . Which, we now, find in the best of Samsung phones like the  Samsung Galaxy Note 9  and  Samsung Galaxy S9+ . So, this makes it a flagship device, but, there should be a catch as the A-series are never about being flagships. Maybe there will be compromises on other aspects of the phone, just like the  Pocophone F1 .   Besides that, there’s not much information about the phone.

Well, there is a lot of competition and it’s a jungle out there! So, well, this could be a good move.         With very less information, most of the other things are based on speculation. Since the A9 and A8s feature  6 GB RAM to 8 GB RAM , the A10 will probably have the same too. And since the  triple camera setup  is taking the smartphone world by storm, we might see it on the A10.

And this time, with all new  Infinity-O display . Namely known as the Samsung Galaxy A8s, the new smartphone comes with an in-display camera and a capable Snapdragon 710 chipset on the board.   Samsung Galaxy A8s Overview  The major highlight of this phone is the camera. The phone flaunts a 24MP selfie shooter on the front. And to place the selfie camera on the front, Samsung has neither included bezel on the top of the display nor incorporated a notch. Samsung rather punched a hole of 6.7mm on its display to house the selfie camera and all other necessary sensors inside.   On the rear panel, the smartphone giant has been quite generous in terms of camera counts. The Samsung Galaxy A8s comes with a triple camera setup on its back just like its sibling, the  Galaxy A7 2018 . This time, the smartphone giant has included a 24MP main sensor, which comes with a wide f/1.7 lens. Additional 10MP telephoto camera and a 5MP depth camera complete the triple camera setup.         As mentioned earlier, the phone comes with Snapdragon 710 chipset. Although the SD710 is not a flagship-grade processor, it is fairly capable to run and handle even some high-end games. Samsung has also incorporated 6GB/8GB of RAM alongside to add fluidity on multitasking and app switching. In terms of memory too, the phone has been generous with 128GB of onboard storage. And to expand to storage further, Samsung has also included an SD card slot. Users can expand the storage up to 512GB making use of the SD card.   On the display front, we will be seeing a 6.4-inch (6.2-inch when curved) IPS LCD display on the handset. The display will feature Full-HD+ resolution in a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. So we can expect the contents to look fairly sharp on its display.   In terms of battery, the phone flaunts a 3400mAh battery, which uses USB Type-C port to gulp the power juice. And since the phone supports Adaptive fast charging support, the phone won’t cling to the wall charger for a long time to get itself fully charged.

The pre-order for the device was said to start from December 21. And as today is the date, as the tech giant promised, the phone is now available for pre-order from the Chinese e-commerce website  JD.com . The device now lies on the shelf of the e-commerce platform tagged along with the price of CNY 2,999 (equivalent to $435 or NRs. 48,500) for the base variant. The handset is available in Elf Blue, Aurora Black, and Allen Silver color options. So the interested ones will have an ample number of alternatives to choose from.   Although the pricing of the base variant looks attractive considering the specs, we still don’t have any information regarding the higher-end variant (8/128GB). But we can expect that there may not be a significant difference between the two variants when it comes to the pricing. Also, the device is available for pre-order only in China as of now. And the availability of the device outside of the PRC is still uncertain. So there is nothing much for us to be excited now.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-galaxy-a8s-specs.jpg']

There were two iPad Pros –  an 11″ one  and a  12.9″ model . The iPad Pros’ price  start at $749  and can go all the way  up to $1899  for the beefiest storage. But there’s something off about these latest iPad. They bend over time with pressure.   After many users complained that their iPad Pros were bent out of the box, while others had their iPad Pro bending after some time; Apple admitted that some of their products have  a slightly bent chassis . And that is, apparently, a slight deformity in their manufacturing process which won’t affect their performance.   Source:\xa0   MacDonaldTrump  /  MacRumors\xa0Forum \xa0  Apple also went on to say that the bending wouldn’t worsen than that. So, it’s not a defect. The bend occurs because of the cooling processes required in the aluminum and plastic components of the iPad Pro. And even though there are a lot of questions on the structural rigidity of the iPad Pro, Apple claims it still stands by the product. Meaning,  the company says, there is nothing wrong with the product .         And this is even after there are so many users who posted videos online about how easily it bends. The complaints are there in YouTube, MacRumors forum, Twitter, and just all over. And even with all of this, Apple is “standing by” its product. And so, it’s not sure if Apple will replace the bent products of customers. We don’t know about all market. But, in the European market,  Apple will have to replace them under the EU Consumer Laws .   Now, this doesn’t seem like anything new from Apple, does it? We all know of the 2014 Apple’s “Bend Gate” when  iPhone 6 Plus  bending issues surfaced. Also, Apple standing by all this isn’t new either. It seems like Apple is trying to say that “Real iPads have curves…they bend a little, that’s how you know it’s an Apple product, right?”  And these  iPad Pros are also available in Nepal  as well. If any of you have bought it and faced any such issues, do let us know. Also, what do you think about this new issue from Apple? Classic Apple, am I right?

['Nvidia RTX 2060 coming soon – What can we expect?'],"['Gaming', 'NVIDIA']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['December 19, 2018']",2018-12-19 12:01:26+00:00,"['The Turing architecture hasn’t actually made much of a dent in the world of graphics processing. Although I would argue that their full potential is yet to be discovered. Our question for today is how will the Nvidia RTX 2060 perform, especially with ray tracing. Even more importantly how much will it cost and when are we getting a mobile version?\xa0  Will Nvidia call it the RTX 2060?  As with the RTX branding, the GPU will need to handle ray tracing. To deliver better ray tracing performance you need RT Cores. For starters, the  RTX 2080Ti FE  edition has 78 RT Cores. The  RTX 2070 FE  cuts that in half, and is pretty much unable to run games with ray tracing on at 1080p resolutions.    With that said, we can only expect lower RT Cores on the RTX2060, which might make it’s ray tracing unusable at best. But here is the catch, the RTX 2060 won’t be a direct replacement for the GTX 1060. That brings in a lot more questions than it answers. First off, Nvidia’s three graphics cards currently on sale feature RT cores, that’s where the name RTX comes from.        Also Read:  Nvidia RTX Titan – The most powerful desktop GPU  We can confirm the naming, the “2060” will get the RTX tagline at the front. Why does it matter? Well, we for sure know now that the Nvidia\xa0RTX 2060 will come with RT cores. Historically, be it the GTX 1060, 960 or the 860 were the best value for money GPUs in their respective prime times. So should the RTX2060, the main reason why most people are actually waiting for it.\xa0  Not a GTX 1060 replacement?  Yes, the three existing latest and greatest are selling ok, but even Nvidia should feel that the RTX 2060 is a lot more important. So, for all the enthusiasts, it’s coming, second week of January to be exact. Back to why the RTX 2060 won’t be a direct replacing the GTX1060, most probably because of all that GTX1060 that Nvidia has in stock.\xa0  Leaked image of RTX 2060 Image 2 Image 3  Remember all those crypto-currency  hype  when graphics cards were selling like crazy. Yup, Nvidia decided to actually ramp up the production for mid-range cards. With the on-going present situation, it’s safe to assume they failed to sell a huge chunk of it. Even worst, with the RTX 2060 releasing a lot faster than expected, buying a Pascal card would be a big NO!  Rumored Specs of the RTX 2060  The Nvidia RTX 2060 is said to boast 1,920 CUDA cores with 30 SMs. Those SMs will see themselves paired with a single RT core each for a total of 30 RT Cores. Similarly, we might as well see 240 Tensor Cores. The 30 RT Cores should be enough to push out 5 Giga Rays Per second, which is the absolute minimum. The Die size also comes in at 445mm 2 , which should make it a huge GPU.  Nvidia RTX 2060  (Leaked Specs) GTX 1060 RTX 2070 GTX 1070 GPU TU106 GP106 TU106 GP104 Die size 445mm 2 200mm 2 445mm 2 314mm 2 CUDA Cores 1,920 1,280 2,304 1,920 RT Cores 30 N/A 36 N/A Tensor Cores 240 N/A 288 N/A Price Hopefully under $399 $249 $499 $379  Furthermore, it should come with 6GB of GDDR6 memory. Memory Clock Texture Units and bandwidth should increase to 14Gbps, 120, and 336GB/s respectively. Memory bus and TDP might remain constant at 192-bits and 120W.\xa0 Although, all of these are unconfirmed leaked and might turn out to be false.  Pricing  Pricing will be crucial to the success of this GPU. In my personal opinion, anything under $349 should be a good deal. This should keep the $249 GTX 1060 relevant while keeping itself in the game. But, we might see a price tag somewhere around $399. This could lure most potential buyers to go for the GTX  1070,  until Nvidia’s warehouse runs out of units to ship.  \xa0Conclusion  In a vague comparison, the card in question is about 30% faster than the GTX 1060 and 6% slower than the GTX 1070. Likewise, comparisons with the red team shows\xa0that it’s 22% faster than the RX 590 while just 5% slower than the Vega 56. That is again just guesswork, but they do turn out to be true more often than not.\xa0  As for Ray Tracing, we have already established that even 1080p gaming is quite not possible with ray tracing on. So do we expect 720p gaming, with RT on? Would you trade in lesser resolution for better reflections? I wouldn’t and happily so go for the GTX 1070 rather than the Nvidia RTX 2060. But we will just have to wait and see now, right?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nvidia-RTX-2060.jpg']

The M-series is said to consolidate C, J, and On lineup of smartphones, which are renowned for their budget-friendly nature. Similarly, the A-series will of midrange and semi-flagship standards. And the recent rumors suggest that the Samsung Galaxy M20 would initiate this change in moniker.  As per the report, Samsung Galaxy M20 won’t feature anything new or quirky. The three-camera setup and side-mounted fingerprint on the  Galaxy A7 2018  and the quad camera  setup  at the back on the  Galaxy A9 2018  weren’t that successful in the smartphone box office. And this time, Samsung seems to be cutting down all the gimmicks.  AllAboutSamsung website  from Germany reported that the Galaxy M20 (SM-M205) will feature a whopping 5000mAh battery. If the handset features that amount of battery, the\xa0M20 would be the first ever Samsung smartphone to flaunt that massive battery.  \xa0Samsung has also been ignoring the notch trend all along. To increase the screen-to-body ratio of the display, it came with a punched-hole display on the  Galaxy A8s  rather than a notch. However, this time Samsung seems to adopt the notch. And looking at the image, we can clearly see a water drop or dewdrop style notch. Well, this may be the Samsung’s new Infinity-U display but we will have to wait for its official launch to confirm it.        Source: 91Mobiles  On its notch, the Smartphone giant has housed an 8MP camera surrounded by other necessary sensors. And on the back, there is a dual camera setup and a fingerprint sensor. Dual camera setup is conspicuous on the image. And the leakers suggest that the camera duo comprises of 13MP and 5MP sensors.  The German website also quoted the precise dimension of the device at 156.4 x\xa074.5  x \xa08.8mm. However, the size of the display is still under the unveil. But some rumors suggest that the device would feature a 6.0-inch Full-HD+ display. Since the mid-range phones of 2018 like Galaxy J8 and Galaxy J7 Duo had fairly disappointed us with an HD display, we would be happy if it features Full-HD resolution.  On the performance front, Samsung Galaxy M20 is expected to come with Exynos 7885 chipset along with 3GB of RAM. We had seen this processor on the  Galaxy J7 Duo ,  Galaxy A7 2018 , and the  A8 Plus 2018 . And the performance was great on those devices. So if the handset comes with Exynos 7885 chipset, Samsung might receive tons of praises from its fans. And talking about the storage, the handset would come in 32GB and 64GB variants.  When the rumor about the phone was going wild, we also got some information about its availability. We learned that the handset would first hit on the UK, Germany, France, Poland  and  Scandinavia. However, there is  noinformation  if the phone would be available  on  the countries other than that.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-galaxy-m20-specs.jpg']

There’s also a  dual camera setup at the back  and a single selfie camera at the front. The design also implies a  water-drop / tear-drop / dew-drop notch design  on the display.\xa0         The listing on TENAA also shows that the phone will have a  5.84″ display  and only a  2900 mAh battery .

['Dell XPS 15 9570 Review: The New within the Old'],"['Dell', 'Reviews', 'XPS Series']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['December 18, 2018']",2018-12-18 09:05:10+00:00,"['If you put all the generations of the  Dell XPS 15 laptops  side by side, do you notice any difference? No, right?\xa0They all look the same.\xa0It is safe to say that the XPS series are Dell’s most desirable laptops. They are slim,sleek, lightweight and at the same time, known for the power they pack. The XPS series belong to a class for their own. But looking at these, it seems as if the designers at Dell don’t really have to work that hard.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4beUotJJ8iE   Dell XPS 15 9570 Specifications:   Design and Build: \xa0Aluminum chassis with carbon fiber coating, 35.7 x 23.5 x 1.7 cm, 2 kg  Display: \xa015.6″ Full HD matte panel(1920 x 1080), 100% sRGB & 98% Adobe RGB, 94% NTSC Color Gamut, 390 nits peak brightness  Keyboard:\xa0 Chiclet Keyboard, White backlighting, 1.3 mm key travel  Processor: \xa0Hexa-core 8 th \xa0gen i7-8750H processor, Base-Clock @ 2.2 GHz, Turbo Boost Clock up to 4.1 GHz  RAM: \xa0DDR4 16 GB @ 2666 MHz (2x slots, upgradeable up to 32 GB)  Graphics: \xa04 GB NVidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Max-Q  Battery: \xa06-cell 97 Watt-hours (up to 10 hours of backup)  Adapter:  130 Watts  Storage: \xa0256 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD  Webcam:  Widescreen HD 720p Web-cam  Connectivity: \xa0Killer Gb Wireless AC-1535 (802.11ac, 2×2), Bluetooth 4.1, on-button Fingerprint Scanner  Ports:  2\xa0x\xa0USB A 3.1, 1 x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3 support with 4 PCIe lanes), 1 x 3.5 mm head-phone jack, 1 x HDMI, 1 x SDcard slot  Price: \xa0Rs.200,000 ($1600 international)   Design   We’ve been seeing the same old classic design from all generations. The same  aluminum and carbon fiber chassis  keeps the laptop sturdy. And judging by the heft and feel, it feels like even if you drop it accidentally, nothing bad is going to happen. Also, the aluminum blends into the carbon fiber seamlessly. Plus, the carbon fiber is coated with a soft-touch surface that give a nice smooth feel on the surface all over.\xa0   The only complaint on part of the design is a bad placement of the webcam inside. The position of the webcam is awkward. It has shifted to the center in the 9570 from the left in 9560, but it is still an awkward position for a webcam. The quality of the webcam is okay though, and it seems they’re actually same in all the generations.         The bad webcam placement is because these laptops have very thin bezels around the screen,which is one of the best things about them. There aren’t much changes in the XPS laptops externally. The 9560 had a fingerprint sensor under the keyboard deck. And in the 9570, it is embedded in the power button itself. Besides that, everything looks pretty much the same.   Performance  The biggest change in the 9570 is, of course,the processor. It has the latest  8 th  generation Hexa-core Intel i7-8750H  processor. The major difference between this and the older models is that it has six cores over the quad-cores on the others. This means that it can give you up to  50% faster speeds  in multi-threaded tasks.  It has a  16 GB DDR4 RAM at 2666 MHz frequency . While 16 GB seems standard on all models, the frequency is an improvement over the 2400 MHz of 9560. More frequency means that the RAM can handle more data, so, this is also an improvement over the previous generations.   That helps the performance by a lot. You can have as many tabs open in your browser or be doing quite a lot of tasks at the same time. Yet, this laptop can perform as smooth as butter. Heavy applications, like that of the Adobe suit, run without any kind of stutters too.  You can also opt for an 8 GB variant and a 32 GB one as well. But 32 GB RAM is a bit of an overkill, while 8 GB is not quite enough for a laptop of this caliber. With only 8GB, it is a bit of a hassle to upgrade. You get  2 slots with 2 RAMs , so, you’ll need to replace both the RAMs inside. Hence, it is better to just get one with 16 GB RAM.  The GPU is also updated, with this one incorporating the  NVidia GTX 1050 Ti Max-Q with 4 GB VRAM . The GTX 1050 is the middle of the line graphics performer when it comes to gaming. Sure, the Ti is slightly better, but, this one is a Max-Q, which is built for more power efficiency. So, it doesn’t perform quite as well as the standard 1050 Ti. But even so, it works better than the 1050 found in the XPS 9560. And it can run most games pretty well.  Where the XPS series fails to perform is the thermals. Now, XPS laptops are very thin, which is why, they heat up a lot faster. Due to its thin form factor, ventilation is not really good. And so, the heat stays inside. And because of this, it faces considerable amount of thermal throttling. Which is why, gaming on this for long periods of time is not advised.   Also, since the heat stays inside, the thermal paste tends to dry up pretty quickly. It is a good practice to replace your thermal paste some every 3-6 months if you want a good gaming performance. Even with my unit, which I’ve had for 6 months, I’ve already used thermal paste in it once.  We did test some games on it as well. Witcher 3 performs just okay with it spitting out about 40 frames per second on Medium settings, and only 20 on Ultra Settings. As for FIFA 19, the game spit out over 110 frames per second at Ultra Settings. That is not agraphic intensive game, but, the XPS 9570 is not something that can handleanything intensive.  This laptop is not meant to be a gaming machine. It has the capacity to be one, but it has limitations. It is meant to be a work-horse that can withstand considerable amount of loads – mostly used for heavy applications like video editing and such. And such applications run without any kind of throttling, even though the temperature levels can be high.  Display   Our unit had an  IPS LCD Full HD matte panel , but there is a 4K option available too. The XPS series have some of the best displays. It has ample  brightness at 390 nits , and with its matte finishing, it is quite visible at all lights. As aforementioned, the bezels are pretty thin. The color accuracy is there, with  100% standard RGB ,  94% NTSC Color Gamut Coverage  and  98% Adobe RGB . Due to this very reason, many believe this to be an ideal machine for editing stuff.  Storage  Our unit came with a  256 GB PCIe NVMe SSD  drive and that is quite fast. On our tests, it gaveus up to  2728 MBPS of read speeds  and a slow  339 MBPS of write speeds .  But it might not turn out to be the same for all. The SSD speeds are quite inconsistent even in the same models. The speed of SSDs depend on the manufacturers as well. Our laptop has a  Toshiba XG5 SSD , and so, this is the speed with which it performed.  As for the storage, a 256 GB SSD is not quite enough. You can also add a 2.5” Hard disk drive, but, then,you’ll have to opt for a smaller battery in there. This is one of thedraw-backs of having an ever-so-slim chassis.  Battery  This unit has a good  97 Watt-hour battery , which is pretty ample. It gives over 10 hours of battery backup on regular usage, and about 7 hours while grinding it to heavy tasks. And we have a large battery because our unit only has an SSD. As I already said, if you opt to have a HDD, you’ll have to make do with a 56 Watt-hour unit.  Keyboard and Trackpad   The keyboard and trackpad on this thing are great, and haven’t changed much from the previous generations. The keyboard gives a firm feedback while typing and general typing is comfortable too. The  soft white backlighting  is also easy on the eyes.   The trackpad is nice and large. The glass surface gives a nice feel while tracking and  Microsoft Precision drivers  give accurate gestures. It’s precise, accurate and smooth. Nothing to complain about.  Ports   On the port side, you get all the necessary ports. There are  two USB A’s , a  full-size HDMI , an  SD card slot , a  3.5mm headphone jack , and a  USB-C with Thunderbolt 3  support. And one notable difference on the 9570 is that it’s USB-C finally has 4 lanes of PCIe, which means your external GPU performance can get a boost.   \xa0 Conclusion  To sum things up,the XPS 15 9570 is still one of the best laptops out there. Performance wise, there are large gaming rigs that are better. But no other laptop can give you such a perfect combination of performance, style and build…except, maybe the  MacBook Pro . But, that is very expensive. This is much more affordable.  For around  $1600  or  Rs.200000  here in Nepal, this is one of the best combos of hardware, build and performance. But you’ll also need an external storage option if you opt for the bigger battery.\xa0There are alternatives in the same price range like the  Razer Blade 15  and the  Alienware M15 . You also get the Gigabyte Aero 15W which actually packs better specs. But there’s something compelling about the Dell XPS 9570 that cannot quite be defined.  However, the major issue with this laptop is that it suffers from thermal throttling. Yes, it’s not built for gaming, but this issue’s been here since all previous generations. It is present in the 9550, in the 9560 and in the 9570 as well. By now, Dell should have figured out a solution in the design for this, but they haven’t. And so, it’s getting a little old now. It’s high time that Dell refreshes the XPS series.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dell-xps-15-9570-review.jpg']

And this is something of an interesting concept turned into reality. It is under the Thulo Group organization, which is also a pioneer of e-commerce in Nepal.  The current scenario of Nepali tourism is a bit traditional. Gone are the days when you had to enquire by telephone about all kinds of tickets, hotel bookings and travel packages. But there still exist a bit of hassle when it comes to searching for various travel itineraries.\xa0And it’s not easy for the tourism businesses either. Meeting client requirements is not easy. Combining Airlines, Hotels and Holiday packages is a tough task and updating them constantly is another.\xa0\xa0  Enter  Tourism Core . It is a new cloud platform, as a growth engine for tourism businesses. The first of its kind in Nepal, it is an all-in-one cloud platform that helps tourism businesses expand, improve and develop their services. In a nutshell, it will enable such businesses to sell domestic and international airline tickets, holiday packages and hotel rooms right from their website.\xa0        What is Tourism Core?  This platform is a  Saas (Software as a Service)  for businesses that acts as a “middle-man” between customers, travel agencies and the other tourism industries. But this middle-man eliminates all the hassles that exists while accelerating and simplifying the procedures. Which means, it brings airlines, hotels, and travel agencies under one heading – in the business’ own website. Even if you don’t own your website yet, this cloud platform will assist you in creating one, and integrating their services within. And their services are designed to suit needs of all kinds of industries – small to large.\xa0  How it works?  To assist in the businesses in their activities, Tourism Core consists of  11 core clouds . Each cloud represents a service they provide. These clouds are  Hotel Cloud, Airline Cloud, Holiday Cloud, Payment Cloud, CMS Cloud, Advertising Cloud, Events Cloud, Service Cloud, Analytics Cloud, Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud . By the names, it should be clear which cloud provides what service. Businesses can choose to integrate those clouds partially as per their requirement or get the complete package as well. And all these work in both B2C and B2B models.\xa0   Any business that uses this SaaS will be able to  sell their products, receive payments directly, sell tickets, generate reports, access data analytics for their business, manage employees , etc. Also, the payments are easier with various integrated payment gateways in this system. Businesses can use multiple local payment gateways such as Nabil, Khalti, nPay, NIBL, and international ones like PayPal, American Express, etc.\xa0Basically, manage every aspect of their business and website from one single back office.\xa0  Of course, a system that does all of this will probably be a bit complex. Tourism Core claims you need very less knowledge about the technology to integrate it in your business. Everything is automated. But of course, being a complex system, and that too, including cloud platform technology, a technical know-how is a basic requirement.\xa0  Availability  However, this is an innovatve idea that is now in action.\xa0And it is, at present, in its beginning stages. So, out of the 11 cores,  only 5 core clouds – Airline, Holiday, Hotel, Payment and CMS clouds are ready to use from the launch day . Other services will be coming soon. Also, it might have small nitty gritty flaws. But in the future, it will all be worked out. And we might really see a truly automated tourism industry in Nepal.\xa0  For more information about plans, packages and rates, visit  Tourism Core']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tourism-Core.jpg']

But some  Lenovo phones  were quite popular. And now, it seems the company is about to reveal yet another phone, the Lenovo Z5s. While the phone is set to be revealed on December 18th in China, we’re still in the dark about it. But the company has itself teased some specs and promo posters on Weibo.\xa0  According to the leaks, the most exciting part about the Z5s is the sheer size of the RAM it packs. It is hinting at more than 8 GB RAM. Which, of course, means a  10 GB RAM  in the phone. That would make it the world’s sixth phone with 10 GB of RAM. But the excitement kinda ends there. Because, according to the leaks, the phone is going to have a  Snapdragon 678 processor .\xa0   That is a chipset which is yet to release. But the model name suggests it is a mid-range chipset, which is a slight upgrade over the Snapdragon 675 but not quite there with the Snapdragon 710. So, this brings the question: What are you going to do with 10 GB of RAM? That is an odd combination. A Snapdragon 845 with 6 GB of RAM would give a much better performance.\xa0        Onto other aspecs of the phone, the phone will come with a  triple camera setup of 13 MP + 5 MP + 2 MP .

It will also have  Android 9.0 Pie  as well.\xa0  So, yes. With this specs, is it a mid-ranger? Is it a flagship? Hard to tell, really. A gaming phone would require a better processor than the Snapdragon 678. And a 10 GB RAM would be quite useless on any other kind of phones. Also, the camera setup looks like that of a mid-ranger. But the phone’s name is being branded as Z5s – with the company focusing on the ‘s’ denoting speed!\xa0  We shall only know what stunt the company’s trying to pull when the phone launches.

But that may very well change with Samsung’s M-series coming soon.  And not only the M-series, but we might get a revamped A-series of phones from Samsung as well. Yes, there is an A-series right now, which comprises of upper mid-range phones. But now, it seems the A-series will also include lower to mid-range phones.

Oppo R17 Pro was the first flagship Oppo device in Nepal and it is still among the limited R-series devices to launch in Nepal. When it was first launched it was an overly priced device, to say the least, however, it has since received a price drop. Does the latest price of Oppo R17 Pro in Nepal justify the hardware it packs?\xa0  Oppo Reno 17 Pro Overview  Display and Design\xa0  We have to give it to OPPO, however, for including interesting breakthrough technologies in the OPPO R-series. And the OPPO R17 is no exception. The phone packs a large\xa0 6.4″ AMOLED screen \xa0with\xa0 Full HD+ resolution \xa0on a glass body. There’s\xa0 Gorilla Glass 6 \xa0on the screen for protection as well. It has about\xa0 402 PPI pixel density \xa0and has a water-drop notch up top for more screen real estate. However, that means no notification LED lights though. From the front, it can be very easily confused with the\xa0 OnePlus 6T .   The back is also not very different, except that the phone has two-tone gradient coloring and triple camera setup. No fingerprint sensor at the back, which means it’s embedded in the screen itself.        Camera  Among the\xa0 triple camera setup , the primary one is a\xa0 12 MP lens with variable apertures (f/1.5 – f/2.4) . We’ve seen it in the likes of\xa0 Samsung Galaxy S9+ \xa0and the\xa0 Galaxy Note 9 . The secondary sensor is a whopping\xa0 20 MP depth sensor with f/2.6 aperture \xa0and auto-focus. If you ask me, that’s just too much of a gimmick. A 5 MP depth sensor would work just fine. Anyways, the third one is not a camera per se, but a\xa0 3D stereo TOF (time-of-flight) camera  for Augmented Reality applications. OPPO has not provided anything of that sort, for now, so, it’s pretty much useless. Maybe, they’ll come up with something in the near future. Another gimmick? It looks like one to me.\xa0     As for the selfie camera, the water-drop notch at the front houses the\xa0 25 MP lens with f/2.0 aperture . The device does support \xa04K video recording at 30 fps . And as for camera quality, there is no doubt OPPO won’t be letting us down.\xa0  Performance and Memory  Powering the phone is an\xa0 octa-core Snapdragon 710 chipset , along with\xa0 8 GB of RAM . This is something that is a turndown, as for its price, we should be getting a flagship processor. There’s also a 6 GB RAM variant but will not be making its way here. We only get the 8 GB / 128 GB option. There’s also an SD card slot in there, but that one is a hybrid, so, if you want to use two SIMs, no SD card for you. But of course, it’ll take you quite a lot of content and effort to fill up that 128 GB.\xa0     Battery  As for the battery, the R17 Pro has a good-sized  3700 mAh battery  and that should be pretty adequate. The Snapdragon 710 is a power-efficient chipset, so, we can expect slightly above a day’s usage on a single charge. Also, this phone has  Super VOOC charging . Meaning, the 50 W charger pumps up your phone from 0 to 40% in only 10 minutes!

However, it’s been more than a year since the launch and Oppo have slashed the price.\xa0  Right now, the price of Oppo Reno R17 in Nepal is Rs 59,990 for the 8/128GB variant.

Right off the bat, the DJI Mavic 2 Pro features a  20 MP Hasselblad UHD 4K Gimbal camera . The camera has a  1″ CMOS sensor with adjustable aperture between f/2.8 to f/11 . Also, the adjustable aperture means you can control how much light enters through. You can also record  10-bit HDR videos  as well.\xa0  This drone also features  10-bit Dlog-M color profile  that makes for great dynamic range. And that means more flexibility in grading room during post production. The large 20 MP sensor gives fantastic resolution for aerial photography and videography. Zooming, cropping or enlarging any taken image will not make you lose quality in a noticeable way.\xa0        The Mavic 2 Pro has narrow apertures, but it has this  Hyper-Light feature . That is a low light setting designed to enhance your image quality while reducing noise. In addition, the Mavic 2 Pro has an  ISO range of 100 – 12800 , which is incredibly useful for low-light situations. Looking at this, it looks like a significant upgrade over the Mavic Pro. And if you have used the  DJI Mavic Pro , you know what kind of image quality you’ll be getting. And this one is even better.\xa0  Besides image quality, the build of the DJI Mavic 2 Pro looks great. It is lightweight, and very responsive. DJI’s flight software is top-notch and highly reliable too. If you’ve used a DJI before, you’ll know. And even if you haven’t, it won’t be very difficult to get used to. Also, it has Omnidirectional Obstacle Sensing, which is a highly useful feature during navigation.\xa0  It gives up to 31 minutes of flight time and offers a top speed up to 44 miles per hour. Also, it is equipped with  OcuSync 2.0 Transmission Technology  – the latest version of DJI’s video transmission technology. And it allows you to see what your drone see – in real time, and that too, in 1080p.\xa0  The Mavic 2 Pro costs about  $1500 in the international market , and here, in Nepal, it costs  Rs.210000 . Yes, the price looks a bit steep. But then again, there’s no other drone that offers as much features as the DJI Mavic 2 Pro.

But with their latest release- MediaTek Helio P90, the company aims to bring flagship level power into mid-range smartphones.\xa0  The Helio P90 launched in China very recently eight-core and focuses on achieving the AI level performance found in flagships. It claims that it can have four times the AI performance than that of the P60 and P70. And sitting below the company’s X-series chips, it seems to be targeting Qualcomm Snapdragon 700 series.

It’s image processing capabilities can equate to even the likes of flagship phones like the  Huawei P20 Pro , and it could even be better!  In layman’s terms, the P90’s image processing abilities can track full body movement – not only faces, which is great for capturing videos, or building 3D avatars or such apps. It also has enhanced depth perception that can generate real-time bokeh effects in stills and videos. The depth perception also means better face detection, in both photography and biometric security as well.\xa0  The chip will be able to support dual cameras with up to 24 MP and 16 MP. It can also support capturing 4K videos at 30 fps. In addition, it can also be used for features like better beautification, improved automatic exposure, real-time photo / video enhancements, multiple object recognition and AI noise reduction.\xa0  The Helio P90 might appear on mid-range phones in the first half of 2019.

['Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition with two AMOLED displays and three cameras is now official'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['December 12, 2018']",2018-12-12 10:36:30+00:00,"['To kill the trend of the display with the notches and to increase the screen to body ratio, we saw lots of attempts this year. It really started with the  Vivo Nex smartphone  with the pop-up camera. The attempt from Vivo garnered loads from the tech community. But Vivo didn’t stop there.\xa0 This time, the smartphone maker came up with a secondary display as an attempt to obliterate any sort of bezels or notches on the main display. Earlier rumors suggested the name of the phone to be  Vivo Nex 2 . However, the company presented the smartphone entitling it as the Vivo Nex Dual display edition.  Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition Overview  To avoid the notch, we saw different antics from the different manufacturers. In that case, Vivo’s pop up camera on the Nex and motorized camera system on the O ppo’s Find X w ere cool but seemed vulnerable on the long run. So this time, Vivo embraced the concept of the dual display, which we saw recently on the  ZTE Nubia X . But unlike the Nubia X, Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition has adopted Super AMOLED screen on both the front and on the rear panels.   Vivo has equipped a 6.4-inch display panel on the front, which Vivo claims to feature a whopping 91.63% screen to body ratio. The front display comes in a tall and narrow form factor with19.5:9 aspect ratio featuring a Full-HD+ resolution. And on the back, there is a 5.5-inch display, which comes in a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. The rear panel also comes with Full-HD resolution. So contents on both the screens is definitely going to look all sharp and vibrant.        Adopting the second display, Vivo has completely given up on the front camera. However, there are three cameras at the back, which can be used to capture the selfies making use of the secondary display. The three cameras on the phone comprise of the 12MP primary camera backed by a 2MP depth sensor. There is also a third f/1.3 lens paired with a time of flight (TOF) 3D module. According to Vivo, the third or the 3D TOF camera would help in point-to-point distance measurement, which comes handy on securely unlocking the rear display. Vivo also claimed that the 3D TOF camera would help in the “personalized beautification”.   The phone also has a “lunar ring” on the rear panel, which not just looks decorative but also is functional. The ring glows with fancy colors to alert about the notifications. Its soft glow can also be used to create diffused lighting for low light shots. That’s not all, the lunar ring can also be set to pulse along with your music.  So the phone uses the rear camera to unlock the rear display. But how to unlock the front display, you might ask. The phone is equipped with an under display fingerprint sensor to unlock the front display. And unlike the  OnePlus 6T , which uses the under display fingerprint sensor as an excuse to obliterate the 3.5mm headphone jack, the 3.5mm jack is intact in the case of Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition.  On the performance front, the phone flaunts the Snapdragon 855 chipset, the flagship chipset of 2018. And aiding for the fluid performance, the phone packs a whopping 10GB of RAM. In terms of internal storage, there is non-expandable 128GB of onboard memory.  Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition Price & Availability  The Nex Dual Display Edition will go sale on China from December 29. However, Vivo has not yet announced the availability of the phone outside of China.

I am too. But I browse memes…but it might not be the same for you. Most people are generally texting others late at night before they go to sleep. And that can actually lead to a modern bad habit – Sleep Texting.\xa0  Most of us who use our phones right until we sleep have another bad habit. Keeping our phones right next to us on the pillow. But that is not as bad as what it can actually lead to. Yes, sleep texting. And it is a “phenomenon” which occurs when an individual sends or responds to a text message electronically while in sleep state.\xa0  Also Read:\xa0 More than half of the world is connected to the Internet today!        Think about it. You have your phone next to your pillow, and you receive a notification about a text message. Your body is programmed to reach for it even if you’re half asleep! In that state, you reply whatever, but will probably not remember it the next morning. That is purely instinct, but one brought about by our habit of being on our phone most of the time.\xa0  This actually comes from a study conducted at  Villanova University . Researchers surveyed about  370 students  and found this problem more common than previously thought. Some  25% of the students  admitted to sleep texting previously as well. Out of which,  over 70%  didn’t remember doing it whereas  25%  of them did not remember what they texted.\xa0  The lack of memory is not surprising, as people generally don’t remember the last moments before they drift off to sleep. And similar is the case with those who wake up after sleeping for a short while. They are in a half asleep state, but the body instinctively does the texting. So, those who do it have no idea they did it anyway.\xa0  Not a very strange thing, is it? Many tend to fall asleep while talking to someone on the phone late at night. They, too, have no memory of what they say before completely dozing off. A result of smartphone addiction combined with our lifestyle. Yes, human evolution surely knows no bounds!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sleep-texting.jpg']
['Things to consider while buying an SSD'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['December 12, 2018']",2018-12-12 08:01:18+00:00,"['SSDs are great, they help give your old sluggish PC a new life. No matter how much of a RAM or even a processor upgrade you do on your PC, if your hard disk is the bottleneck, it’s just going to perform more or less the same. So, it’s safe to say that an SSD is the best upgrade you can perform on  you  PC/Laptop if it doesn’t have one already.  However, there are certain cases you won’t see much of a difference. One of which is gaming. Your gameplay or the FPS will remain almost exactly the same although the game loading times will decrease significantly. SSDs only help if your storage device is a bottleneck, which is most of the times.\xa0\xa0  If you are in Nepal just like me, SSDs are making a mark. There was a time when you would have to call up your distant uncle or that one guy who is friends with your other friend to bring you the SSD you want at the price you can afford, just because they were returning to Nepal.         But that is changing and these days you can buy an SSD from absolutely anywhere at reasonable prices. But before you do that there are a few things you need to consider first.  Also Read:  PC Building Guides  Size of an SSD  The first and foremost is the size of an SSD, or moreover the size your computer supports. SSDs aren’t “plug and play” devices, rather they are to be fitted inside your CPU, never to be taken out unless absolutely necessary. You will also be using a few screws to put them in place too.  If you are planning to use an SSD your system doesn’t support, just don’t. If you absolutely have to maybe try a converter. These days you can find converters for anything to anything and they are pretty cheap as well.\xa0 But nothing trumps native support so pick your fight wisely. We will be looking at two of the most popular SSD sizes on the market these days.  1. M.2 SSD  The first is an M.2 which you might have heard.\xa0If you have a relatively new PC or laptop, there is a high chance that it will support an M.2 SSD. If it does, you need to figure out its size. The M.2 is just a general form factor, while there are multiple sizes an M.2 SSD comes in.  While the industry has agreed on a standard width size of 22mm, the length is where it just goes bananas. With three different length sizes coming in at 80mm, 60mm, 42mm, and a few others you will need to figure out which one your system supports. You can either open up your PC/Laptop or just check your user manual.\xa0   Although there are like 5 different sizes, the most common is the 80mm one. It’s also the most easily available M.2 storage device out there. They aren’t the cheapest, but they are some of the most reliable ones out there. If your system supports this type of SSD you can jump directly to the “Types of SSD”.\xa0  2. 2.5″ SSD  If your system, unfortunately, doesn’t support an M.2 SSD, a 2.5″ SSD will fit in almost any PC or laptop out there. To start with, your laptop is probably already rocking a 2.5″ hard drive, which you can just swap out for an SSD of the same size.\xa0   If you are on a PC, it’s even easier, there is almost always room for a 2.5″ storage device on the casing. If by chance, there isn’t, you can get a 2.5″ to 3.5″ adapter bracket to fit your SSD.\xa0  Types of SSD  There are a few types of SSD and their own host interfaces. But to make things simple, we will look at two types of logical interfaces most commonly used and readily available right now. They include SATA 3\xa0(6.0 Gbit/s) and PCIe\xa0(31.5 Gbit/s) logical interface, which will reflect directly on the speeds you will get and the price you will have to pay.  So, to make things simple, just figure out if your system supports PCI Express. If it doesn’t then you are stuck with the SATA 3 interface. This isn’t actually a bad thing, a SATA3 SSD is still twice as fast as a traditional hard drive. These are also the most common ones out there and are pretty much as cheap as an SSD gets.  While you can buy a SATA 3 SSD, even though you have an empty PCIe lane, the SSD will work as it should but you will be throwing away a lot of potential performance. You can also do the exact opposite and use a PCIe SSD on an mSATA interface, but here you are just wasting you money on a more expensive SSD.  We obviously recommend you get the correct type of SSD for your interface, but if you are on a budget, going with a SATA 3 SSD for your PCIe supported PC should be OK. The other way around however isn’t recommended unless you plan to change your whole system sometime soon.  Pricing  After you have decided on the size and type of SSD you need, you now need to decide how much you are willing to spend on it. SATA SSDs starts at around 5k for 128GB and the prices will go up depending on their capacity and quality.   Comparing prices of both types of SSDs, a normal SATA 3 SSD costs about 8k for 256GB while a PCIe SSD will cost you well over 12k for the same storage. You are paying that extra for more speed and reliability. Here is the official price list of Transcend\xa0for the month of September 2018 for reference.  SSD Price\xa0 SATA III 820 M.2 SSD (120GB) Rs 5,750 SATA III 820 M.2 SSD (240GB) Rs 9,000 SATA III 820 M.2 SSD (480GB) Rs 18,750 PCIe NVMe M.2 110s (256GB) Rs 12,500 PCIe NVMe M.2 110s (512GB) Rs 21,875  Where to buy one?  Online retailers like Daraz or SastoDeal do sell SSDs in both sizes. You can also try local retailers, like that computer shop you actually bought your system in. Or you can also try  hamrobazar , which is just filled with brand new and second hand SSDs.\xa0  What next?  After you install your new SSD, the first thing you should do is install a fresh clean copy of windows on that new storage device. Sure you can just use it as a fast file storage but that’s neither optimal nor is it going to make your PC run faster. The only way you can take full advantage of that SSD is if you install your windows on that device.  If you were running on a genuine copy of Windows 10, you do not need to worry about activation, the BIOS takes care of that. If you use a crack, well you don’t have to worry about activation at all. After that, you can just install all your software on your SSD while your hard disk is there if you need cheaper storage space.\xa0  This is obviously what we recommend but if you planned anything else for your SSD, well, you paid for it.\xa0  Conclusion  So, now you know the easiest way to buy an SSD. For PC users, this process should be easy. For laptop owners, however, opening up your computer can be a bit more complicated. There is also a high chance you will void your warranty while doing so.\xa0 But it should all be worth it, an SSD is the best thing that can happen to your system and you will feel it right off the start.

Now, we’re seeing some pictures and have an idea about some specs that it is going to pack. The  Nova 3  got a great response, and we can expect similar from the Nova 4. But…the Nova 4 is shaping up to be all too familiar.\xa0  What I mean, is based on some leaked specs and photographs, we have a better idea of what the Nova 4 is going to look like. And surprise surprise…it looks like a twin to the  Huawei P20 Pro , at least from the back. The dual gradient colors with the triple camera setup, the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and everything. At the front, however, the screen has a hole on the top left corner for the selfie camera as promised.\xa0  The screen is a large  6.41″ , but no confirmation on whether it will be an LCD panel or AMOLED. But for a phone such as this, it will most likely have an LCD panel. There are three cameras at the back, arranged just like the P20 Pro. And among them, the primary sensor is a  whopping 48 MP  camera!\xa0        Source: Weibo  Yes,  higher mega-pixel count generally doesn’t mean it’s all that goo d, but, Huawei’s AI camera have never disappointed. And needless to say, these cameras will have better AI integration as well. The phone also packs a good sized  3900 mAh battery .\xa0  Further specs are yet to be revealed, but the phone should pack the latest  Kirin 980 . Since it has a 48 MP sensor at the back, it will need serious power, especially for image processing, and AI capabilities.

['Which processor should you choose while buying a computer?'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides', 'How to']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['December 10, 2018']",2018-12-10 05:48:52+00:00,"['I feel you, the process of buying a good computer is a tiring work. It can be a very crafty job to find the right computer with the right specifications that will work for you. Because everyone’s different needs. Of course, if you have extra cash to throw around, you could get yourself a very high-end computer and not worry about it. However, most of us have a limited budget to spend on computers.  Choosing the right processor is one of the most important and tricky things because unlike RAM and Hard Disk, you can’t judge a processor by just numbers. There are a lot of other factors like Cache, Hyper-threading, Cores to consider. Plus, money is also another essential element because the processors are expensive. If you don’t need a very powerful processor, why waste your hard earned money on it?  So, how do you choose which processor to buy? Don’t worry, I will guide you thoroughly in this article. After reading this post, even a non-technical person can find choosing the best-fit-for-your-need processor to be an easy-peasy job.        First of all, if you live Nepal, you can choose from two brands: AMD or Intel. However, Intel is more readily available in the market. Therefore, I will be talking about Intel processors only (I don’t want you to be more confused. So, let’s stick with Intel).  Intel has it’s Core I series of processors, with a total of four variants, three of them readily available in Nepal. If you are confused, the Core i3, Core i5, and the Core i7 are the common ones. While the Core i9 is both more powerful and is just the best, they are pretty expensive.  HOW TO IDENTIFY GENERATIONS  Before you know how to identify the generation of a processor, you should note that in today’s age, i.e 2018 you should not buy anything that isn’t 8th Gen or higher. Even when you get a chance to buy a last-gen Core i7 vs a current-gen Core i5, get the latest one. While this seems pretty easy there is a lot of other things you need to consider.  1. Look at the Intel sticker (simple as that!)   For starters, as long as you are not buying an old processor, the generation is written right on the little sticker that comes with your laptop. If you are a desktop person, the packaging will have the generation written all over it. You will also get a sticker with the packaging for desktops while the sticker on laptops come pre-installed.\xa0  2. Look at the processor serial number.  For this, you need to boot\xa0the computer and look at the computer properties. There you will see processor numbers.  PC: Processor Number  The number after i3, i5 or i7 is the generation. For instance, in the picture above, the processor names are “Intel Core i7-7500 U” and “Intel Core i7-7Y75”; the number 7 after i7 means it is a seventh-generation processor. If it was 6th generation, the processor number would be “Intel i7 6XXXX”  Now that the problem of identifying the generation is resolved, let’s look at the difference between i3, i5 and i7.  Difference Between i3, i5 and i7  No, the numbers 3, 5 and 7 don’t represent the number of cores or processing speed (GHz). These numbers just show the relative performance based on the number of cores, clock speed (in GHz), the size of cache memory, Turbo Boost and Hyper-Threading. Well, in short i7 is better than i5, which in turn is better than i3.  Number of Cores:  i3 has two to four cores, i5 has 2 to 6 cores and i7 has 2 to 8 cores. A higher core\xa0count doesn’t mean better performance. If an application is capable of utilizing multiple cores, that is the only way more cores help. Intel has introduced features like Hyper-Threading and Turbo Boost that cannot be overlooked. But, the size of cache memory matters as well.  Hyper-threading:  Thread is a process in simple term. Usually, one core can perform one task (thread) at a time. But with hyper-threading, Intel can process two tasks in a single core. Which means the two physical cores act as four cores (virtual), thus increasing speed. So, your dual-core i3 will act like it has four cores.  The Intel Core i3 series and the Intel Core i7 series support hyper-threading.\xa0The Intel Core  i5 series  (quad-core) does  not  support it (But, remember physical cores are better than virtual cores).  Turbo Boost:  If you buy i5 or i7, your processor can increase its clock speed (GHz) when needed. This is called Turbo Boost by Intel. For example, if you are playing a game and your system requires some extra power, Intel processor will activate Turbo Boost to make the game run smooth. Unfortunately ,  i3 doesn’t   support Turbo Boost.  Cache Memory:  Cache is a memory (like RAM) inside the processor. So, the greater the cache memory size, the better the processor will perform. i3 has 3 to 8MB of cache, i5 has 3-9MB,\xa0i7 has 4-12MB cache and the latest Core i9-9900k has 16MB of cache.  I know, this all sounded too techie and you are still confused. You are probably still wondering…which one do I buy?  Alpha Suffix  This is the most important part of your buying decision.\xa0You might have noticed a letter or two at the end or somewhere in the middle of your processor’s serial number. That is your processor’s Alpha  Suffix,  or the product line suffix. This letter or letters represent what your processor is actually capable of.  The last letter in the processor number describes how your processor would perform and the list of features it gets. It also defines the processor’s TDP, which is also pretty important as well. Let’s look at a few common suffixes and what they mean for you. I will keep it as simple as possible.  Alpha Suffix Description K Desktop CPU Unlocked Overclockable Performance-oriented Usually has a TDP of 95W Targeted  towards  gamers and Content creation Eg: i9-9900k HK Laptop CPU Unlocked Overclockable Performance-oriented for laptops TDP of 45W Eg: i9-8950HK H Laptop CPU TDP of 45W Performance Oriented TDP of 45W Up-to 6 Cores Eg: i7-8750H HQ Laptop CPU Quad-Core Processors TDP of 45W Fairly outdated at this point Eg: i7-7700HQ G Laptop CPU Includes descrete Graphics Eg: i7-8809G U Laptop CPU Ultra-low power TDP of 15W Ultrabook oriented Best of usable power and battery efficiency Eg: i7-8550U Y Laptop CPU TDP of 4.5W Fan-less design Best for ultralight laptops Battery efficiency at it’s best Extremely low power Eg: i7-7Y75  Which processor type is best for you?  First of all, it depends on what you plan to do with your system (laptop/PC). But, worry not! I will tell you more about processor types and the tasks it can do.  i3 \xa0– Good for basic tasks with decent multitasking. If all you do on your computer is surf Internet, use Word, Excel etc., play simple games, and make video calls, then i3 is for you. You will get a cheap computer for all your needs.  i5 – This is good for someone who is Intermediate and active user (someone who wants to do simple video editing, graphics designing). Good for gaming if it has integrated graphics. Basically, if you want better performance at a cheap price, go for i5. In my opinion, this is the best choice because you never know when your needs might increase.  i7 \xa0– This is for the power users. It is similar to the\xa0 flagship phones . It performs very good but is expensive. If you don’t need to do high-end video rendering, well, don’t waste your money (if you have a limited budget, that is).  i9  – The best processor Intel makes for us consumers. Packed with enough power to do almost anything, this is pretty much as good as it gets. If you have the money to buy one, be prepared to spend more on cooling solution.  TDP (Thermal Design Power)  TDP basically means the power a processor needs to work properly according to Intel’s definition of high-complexity workload. Although the TDP only shows the watt consumption under base frequencies.\xa0  If you see anything less than 25W, it’s oriented towards battery life and portability. Anything around 50W are powerful processors, but not fully committed. Above that is basically all performance performance performance.\xa0  Conclusion  So, just to summarize everything, always try and buy the latest gen processor rather than going after Intel’s absurd naming schemes. If you are still confused, just look at the processor’s TDP (Thermal Design Power). If you do finally choose a processor, just look at a few  reviews  before you actually make a purchase.\xa0\xa0  Hope this loooong post helped clear your dilemma.  So, which processor will you be choosing while buying a computer? Let us know in the comments below.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intel-Processor.jpg']
['Vivo Nex 2 Rumours – What’s Next?'],['Vivo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['December 9, 2018']",2018-12-09 17:44:47+00:00,"['Source: The Verge                   If you think you’ve seen all the antics to take this whole all-screen display, think again. We did see the  Vivo Nex S  with a selfie camera slider so that there was no need for a notch or bezels. Then we saw the  OPPO Find X , which upped the Nex S with a slider for both the selfie and the rear cameras. Now, Vivo Nex 2 is coming with two displays just like the  ZTE Nubia X .  Yes, you heard that right. It seems Vivo has leaked some of its images and renders. Maybe a part of their promotion campaign. But nevertheless, it’s out there. And these rumors are actually turning out to be interesting. Here’s what they look like.    The Vivo Nex 2 features two screens: a main  6.59″ Super AMOLED display  and a  secondary 5.5″ display  at the back. Well yes, this is not exactly new…Nubia actually did it first with the  Nubia X . But the secondary screen on this one is a tad bit bigger than Nubia X’s 5.1″ screen. The secondary screen’s display quality will be a thing to be tested.         As for the cameras, there are  three cameras in the rear , as there are none at the front. This was the whole point behind the dual screen. You take selfies with your regular cameras via the secondary screen. And the camera seems to be AI integrated, i.e. the AI combines pictures from those three cameras into one, just like the  Huawei P20 Pro . And while this may mean better regular images, it means amazing selfies- because not only you’re taking selfies with the primary cameras, you’re also getting this AI thing in it!   Still in the camera department, there is a “ Star-Ring ” sort of thing on the back camera, which rotates (in software) to provide better adjustment of the 3D Beauty levels. How it works, we don’t know yet…but it will soon be clear.   The internals of the Vivo Nex 2 aren’t exactly crystal. But rumors suggest it’ll have the  Snapdragon 845  with up to  10 GB of RAM . That’s actually more power than anyone can use – but with two screens and such, it might be necessary. Also, the phone will have an  In-display fingerprint sensor  and probably will sport a  Liquid Cooling System  too.   What do you think of this phone? State-of-the-art? Or too flashy for taste? Whatever it is, seems like phones are going places.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vivo-nex-2-2.jpg']

While the  SD850  was the  SD845  on steroids, its raw performance was just not enough to power Windows 10 and all its Chrome tabs. It did offer a lot in terms of battery life and integrated connectivity, now you also get the performance to rival the likes of Intel and AMD’s solutions.  Built from the ground up with the primary intention to run a Windows 10 PC, the Snapdragon 8cx should deliver on most of its promises. Reviews of the SoC running on its intended platform has been positive so far and we expect nothing less. Let’s start with its specifications to get a brief idea of how it will perform in theory.  Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Specifications   CPU : 8x Qualcomm Kryo 495 CPU  Architecture : 64-bit  Process : 7nm  DSP : Qualcomm Hexagon 690 (Qualcomm Always Aware Technology)  Cellular Modem : Qualcomm Snapdragon X24 LTE modem  Wi-Fi : 802.11ad Wi-Fi standards  Bluetooth : Bluetooth 5.0  Location : Assisted GPS, OTDOA, GPS,\xa0GLONASS,\xa0Beidou,\xa0Galileo,\xa0QZSS,\xa0SBAS  NFC : Yes  RF :\xa0Qualcomm RF Front-End solution; Qualcomm Adaptive Antenna Tuning; High-power transmit  USB : USB 3.1  Camera : Qualcomm Spectra 390; up to 16MP dual camera; up to 32MP single camera  Video : Up to 4k video capture; up to 720p@480fps capture; 4k@120fps playback  Display : Up to 4k on display, up to two 4k external display support  GPU : Qualcomm Adreno 680 GPU; DX12 API support  Memory : 2133MHz; LPDDR4x, 8 Channels  Storage : NVMe SSD; UFS 3.0   The company does say the Snapdragon 8cx will pack twice the performance as compared to the Snapdragon 850. While the new Adreno 680 GPU will handle a 4k on device display with ease, it can also do two 4k external displays as well. Looking at the specs and it’s predecessor, it should easily beat the likes of selected Intel U series processors.         While it can do two 4k HDR displays, 4k HDR videos at 120fps are also playable through hardware acceleration. Qualcomm does mention it offer 2X more graphical performance, this seems justifiable enough. It also runs on the new 7nm architecture, with new Kryo 495 cores, and class-leading\xa0cellular as well as wireless capabilities.  Also Read:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 announced  The Snapdragon 8cx comes with Qualcomm’s x24, but we would have loved to see the x50 5G modem for obvious reasons. The integrated X24 Cat.20 LTE modem, in theory, has a peak download speed of 2Gbps and upload speeds of 316Mbps. As for local wireless connectivity, 802.11ad Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 are also supported.   Now, Qualcomm calls this the “fastest Snapdragon ever”, which isn’t a surprise as laptops and 2-in-1 devices have a higher tolerance for heat compared to a traditional smartphone. Qualcomm also claims multiday battery life, with Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4+ for charging. Qualcomm’s 4th generation AI engine is on board too.  While all this seem promising for now, a certification for Windows 10 Enterprises should boost adoption rates.

Vivo had already hinted towards its launch in Nepal, about a week or so ago. And now, it is here. The phone is the Vivo Y81i. It is a toned-down version of the  Vivo Y81  and costs less than Rs. 20000 in Nepal.  Vivo Y81i Overview  Just like the Vivo Y81, the Y81i also features a  6.22″ IPS LCD display  with  HD+ resolution . There is also a notch on the screen that houses a selfie shooter, ear-piece, and some sensors.  Even in the camera department, the Y81i is very similar to the Y81. The phone comes with a  13MP camera on the back  with aaf/2.2 aperture. Upfront, there is a  5MP camera  with the same aperture. This aperture, however, is narrow, which might not make for good image quality in low light settings.        However, as this is a toned-down version, the Y81i is powered by a  Quad-core MediaTek Helio A22 chipset . Now that is a strictly low-end chipset. Also, combined with only  2 GB RAM  on the phone, we might not get that good of a performance on this phone. Besides that, the phone features only a  16 GB of internal storage , which is expandable with microSD. This phone features a  3260 mAh battery  as well.  However, the phone features no fingerprint sensor even for a phone of this price. We can find fingerprint sensors even on the entry-level and budget phones these days. So this absence is absolutely bummer on the phone. Nonetheless, there is a software-based Face Unlock feature.  This phone is priced at  Rs.18,990  in Nepal. And personally, I think this is exorbitant pricing on Vivo’s part. There are, of course, better phones in this price range…at least in terms of processing power and memory.

While this is also pretty much similar to the  Nokia 6.1 Plus , the only difference is the display is now  HDR 10 compliant .        Credit: Android Central  In the camera department, the phone sports dual cameras at the back. The dual camera setup comprises of a  12 MP primary lens with f/1.8 aperture . Another camera is a  large sensor of 13 MP , but it is only a depth sensor. With that big depth sensor, imagine the portrait shots you will be getting! The primary camera also  has  OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) , which is a great feature to have. The camera also supports 4K video recording at 30 fps.\xa0As for the selfie camera, it lies in the notch and is a  big 20 MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture .  Inside, the phone is powered by a  Qualcomm\xa0Snapdragon 710 , which is a good mid-range chipset. Combined with  4 GB of RAM , this should be a good performer too. Also, the phone has  64 GB of eMMC storage  and is expandable up to 400 GB via microSD card. This phone packs a  3500 mAh battery  along with  18W Fast Charging feature .  It has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and a dual SIM slot, with one being a Hybrid slot. And yes, the 3.5 mm headphone jack is there too. This Android One phone runs on  Android 9.0 Pie .

['Snapdragon 855 Fully Official – The Dragon Awakes!'],['Qualcomm'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['December 6, 2018']",2018-12-06 06:53:48+00:00,"['After a 2-day conference in Hawaii, Qualcomm has fully revealed its latest and the greatest chipset. All hail the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855! This is the company’s first chipset based on the  7nm technology , like Huawei’s  Kirin 980 . But the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 has a lot many improvements. And rightly so, as this chip will be powering numerous flagships in the coming year. The Snapdragon 855 focuses on better AI capabilities, a more powerful GPU, better performance and faster connectivity, as it moves to harness the 5G technology.  Now previously, there were leaks about this very chipset under the name  Snapdragon 8150 . But that was only the code name, the final product will be marketed as the Snapdragon 855. So, don’t confuse one with the other. They’re the same.  Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Chipset Overview  This chipset has 8 cores, just like most others, but it now has a new CPU configuration. The cores comprise of a  single 2.84 GHz Cortex A76 ,  three 2.42 GHz Cortex A76  and  four 1.8 GHz Cortex A-55 . In detail, that would mean a lot of technical jargon. But, basically, a 1+3+4 core design means higher single thread performance sustainable for longer periods of time.\xa0This new tailored design should also mean a  45% boost in CPU performance  from the last gen, according to the company.        Similarly, the new chip can support image processing from up to a 48 MP single camera or 24 MP dual cameras. Also, it can even support recording 4K and HDR videos at 60 fps. Not only that, but this phone is also sporting  HDR10+ playback at 120 fps  and  8K video playback too !\xa0While that certainly means raw power, we think it is too much of an overkill for mobile devices.  Also, the 855 packs a more powerful  Adreno 640 GPU , which should mean a 20% boost in gaming performance. The GPU also offers an HDR pipeline to support high-quality physically-based rendering.  Besides that, the major improvement the Snapdragon 855 provides is in the AI and machine learning department. Now “AI” has been the buzz-word in 2018, with phones trying to beat each other to who’s going to get to the best AI-integration first. And in the Snapdragon 855, Qualcomm puts a  Hexagon 690 DSP  unit. The Hexagon 690 is an improved Digital Signal Processor with 2 additional vector processing units that double the chip’s math crunching capabilities. In layman’s terms, this means up to  3 times increment in Qualcomm’s AI performance . The company also boasts that it is  2 times faster than the  Huawei’s HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset .   Lastly, the chip is emphasizing on better connectivity with 5G. But, the chip  does not have a built-in 5G modem . Qualcomm’s 5G modem, the X50, is not yet fully optimized to be integrated into the SoC itself. But the SD855 can be paired with the X50 modem and radio antennas much better to harness the 5G connectivity.  So, in a nutshell, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 focuses on 5 things: Better Performance, better GPU performance, more powerful AI processing, better image processing, and better connectivity. It seems like the dragon has awoken!  Availability  And since it is now official, it is only a question of which smartphone will get to put one in their smartphone first. As the records show, it is always Samsung’s flagships, but this time around,  it might air on a new OnePlus device first , as  stated by the CEO of OnePlus, Pete Lau . There is no official mention of which smartphone, but it should arrive before the  Samsung Galaxy S10 , which will come out in February. Considering the company only launched the  OnePlus 6T  in October, it won’t be the OnePlus 7. So, maybe we’ll also see a new lineup of devices from the Chinese company.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/qualcomm-snapdragon-855.jpg']
['The Samsung Galaxy S10 will be a 5G-enabled phone with a display hole!'],['Samsung'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['December 6, 2018']",2018-12-06 05:43:27+00:00,"['It’s not even the new year, and there have already been several rumors and speculations surrounding Samsung’s next year’s flagship. Samsung usually launches its S-series smartphones in the first quarter, and it will be the same with this new smartphone which will definitely be named the ‘Samsung Galaxy S10’.  The Galaxy S10 will be one of the most interesting smartphones from Samsung, as it will ditch the little bezels that have sandwiched the display, like on the  Galaxy Note 9 . What for? Well, Samsung has done its own take on this feature by punching a hole to equip the necessary sensors and camera on the front.  A few weeks back, Samsung had shared the designs of the displays the company had been working on. And this punctured display will be known as the Infinity-O display. By the looks of it, the  Samsung Galaxy A8s  and the  Huawei Nova 4  will be among the first smartphones to feature this new take en route the bezel-less future.         The Android software inside the new devices will probably treat the display hole like a notch. It will be interesting to see how much of screen real estate these holes actually cover.  However, this step could come with a cost. Samsung will probably leave the Iris Scanning technology behind to make room just for the camera module and a couple of sensors only. But like a few smartphones of this year, the phone will have an in-display fingerprint scanner. While the devices like the  OnePlus 6T  come with an Optical sensor, the one on the S10 will probably be an ultrasonic sensor that can map a 3D picture of your fingerprint, making the device more secure.  Another major addition to the S-series is the  5G technology . US-carriers AT&T and Verizon recently announced a partnership with the Korean Giant to provide a 5G enabled phone in the first half of the new year. Undoubtedly, this Galaxy device is the S10!  Rumors have suggested that the Galaxy S10 will be available in three variants. There will be the S10, the S10 Plus, and the S10 5G. However, some speculations even point towards four different Galaxy S10 smartphones.   The camera department might also oversee a few changes, especially in the camera count. The  Galaxy A7 2018  and the  Galaxy A9 2018  have three and four rear-cameras respectively. So, according to a few rumors, this new device could have 3 or 4 set of cameras on the back. The renders also point to dual front-facing cameras.  Samsung had unveiled the  Exynos 9820 chipset  only recently, and we expect it to make its way into the Galaxy S10. This new  8nm SoC  will have a performance and graphical boost over its predecessor and also come with a Neural Processing Unit like some of the Apple and Huawei smartphones.  If the renders and rumors are considered, the Samsung Galaxy S10 will definitely be one of the smartphones to look out for in 2019. However, with the addition of new technologies, we also expect it to be expensive.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-rumors.jpg']

The company isn’t stopping just there as they are all set to unveil the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro here.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro Overview  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro is the direct successor to the  Redmi Note 5 AI  which was quite a hit in the Nepali market. However, there are only a couple of subtle changes it has over its predecessor.  The major difference certainly has to be the camera count. This new smartphone features dual cameras on the front, with one measuring 20-megapixel and the other 2-megapixel. The secondary front-facing camera here helps with depth sensing. The rear-cameras are the same though, with a setup consisting of 12-megapixel and 5-megapixel.         Another difference between the Redmi Note 6 Pro and the  Redmi Note 5 AI  is the display and the form factor. The former has a taller 6.26-inch display. This screen is an  IPS LCD panel  and it’s protected by the Corning Gorilla Glass. Also, unlike the Redmi Note 5 AI’s bezels up front, the Redmi Note 6 Pro has a notch on top of the display.  Other than these dissimilarities, both the phones are more or less the same. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro has the same 4,000 mAh battery that is backed by Quick Charge 3.0.

Its 64 GB version is available in India for INR 13,999 right now.

But to our utter surprise, Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro is priced at Rs. 24,999 for the 3/32GB variant and Rs. 28,999 for the 4/64GB variant. Talking about the availability, the phone will be available for purchase from offline Xiaomi stores starting from tomorrow.   Considering the specs and price of the phone, the Redmi Note 6 Pro won’t really be a worthy upgrade. It has almost identical specs to that of the  Redmi Note 5 AI . So paying extra bucks for such minor upgrades do not make any sense here. So I would rather recommend buying the Note 5 AI rather than the Redmi Note 6 Pro for the price.   I am not saying the Note 6 pro is bad by any means. But since you can buy the MI A2 just by adding a couple thousand bucks, that’s where you should focus on.  Xiaomi MI A2  comes at the price of Rs. 30,999. And to justify the price, the phone has packed a more powerful  Snapdragon 660 chipset  and features a more capable hardware. On the top, there is a bloatware-free Stock version of Android OS on the system. So for just two thousand more, you are getting much much more.   If quad-camera setup is what you like on the phone, then you can also check out the  Huawei Y9 2019 . Alike the Note 6 pro, the Y9 2019 flaunts a quad camera setup with dual camera setup at the back and a camera pair on the front. It also comes with a somewhat premium design and build. The phone looks appealing because of its glossy back. But most importantly, it has a Kirin 710 chipset, which leaves the Snapdragon 636 chipset (on the Note 6 Pro) behind by a good margin on the performance front. Additionally, there is a tall 6.5-inch, which might interest the gamers and multimedia fanatics.   If you can push your budget further, you can also get a  Pocophone F1  at the price of Rs. 34,999. The Pocophone comes with the flagship grade Snapdragon 845 chipset on the board backed by a whopping 6GB of RAM. Even if you are a heavy gamer, you don’t have to worry about the phone getting hot after the prolonged gaming session. The phone comes with a liquid cooling technology to cool the internals. Moreover, the phone also has note-worthy cameras. [socialpoll id=”2529262″]']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-price-nepal.jpg']

Because apparently, a study found that those with Apple watches engage in more physical activity. Which leads to more fitness, which leads to a longer life, perhaps. Well, Apple watches also function as  fitness trackers , and prompt you to drink water or run more or things like that. And so, if you do really follow what your Apple watch suggests you to do, you might become fitter and maybe, live longer.  Now, of course, this is only when you follow what your watch tells you to do. If not, then, well, forget what you read here. And yes, there are fitness trackers in other smartwatches too. But you have to agree that the  latest Apple Watch  is kind of the best fitness tracker in a watch. Also, the study was conducted with Apple watch wearers.  The result? Apple Watch wearers were prompted to do 4.8 extra days of physical activity per month. And that translates to 2 years of extra life if continued. According to WHO, about  one-third of the adult population don’t meet their minimum weekly requirement of physical activity . It suggests that adults aged 18-64 should do 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous workout per week to stay healthy. And apparently, the watch encourages you to do more when you meet your targets.        Also Read:  Fitbit Smartwatches Price in Nepal  Of course, the study also involved incentives. Those who were involved in the study had to pay certain fees monthly. But if they achieved their monthly targets, no payments were necessary. And therefore, most got down to doing whatever physical activity that their Apple watches suggested.  In the end, there was not only an increase in overall activity levels but also an increase in intense exercise events. These results depict positive associations between benefit and physical activity. Over a year, the study suggests participants will see numerous health benefits. Improvement in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and cardiac and respiratory fitness are some of them  Conclusion: Smartphones and wearable technology can be the key to helping people improve their health. But of course, there has to be some incentive with it to encourage people.

If you’re feeling nostalgic, maybe you read our article on the  Samsung A8s \xa0with a similar design concept. Although we had been hearing rumors about the Galaxy A8s for a while we still have no information on a launch date.         Going by the current situation seems like Huawei is beating Samsung to the punch. There are also a few rumors that reveal that Samsung is saving this new layout for their new upcoming flagship, the  Galaxy S10 .  Thanks to this new design solution, the Nova 4’s screen-to-body ratio should be quite impressive. We also see no fingerprint scanner at the back, or at the sides, so it’s safe to assume this one will come with an inbuilt fingerprint sensor.  Specifications  According to the rumor mill, the smartphone will feature Huawei’s top of the line  Kirin 980 Octa-Core processor . This is also the world’s first SoC manufactured on a 7nm process. It’s also the same SoC powering Huawei’s current flagships like Mate 20 and Honor Magic 2. We are expecting it to come with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage.

This is nothing new. There have already been a lot of studies and researches regarding this. The phones we carry in our hands are a lot dirtier than an average toilet seat. And maybe you’ll recall that you probably read something like this somewhere. But it didn’t bother you then, and it’s probably not gonna bother you now.  Also Read:\xa0 Using your phone in the bathroom? It could be getting contaminated with dangerous bacteria!  And what’s with toilet seats, you ask? Well, they seem to be the standard for measuring or comparing anything dirty. Because well, toilets seem to be the dirtiest thing that we know of. But of course, that isn’t true…because, well, read the title again. How is it possible? Because our phones are the most used things every day. What do you touch first when you wake up? Phone. What do you touch last before you sleep? Phone. And what do you take with you when you go to the toilet? Phone…because if you don’t, you’ll end up counting the number of tiles in your bathroom.        Why? Our phones are exposed to a lot of things. Mostly, they come in close physical contact several times a day. Also, we do a lot of things with our hands – open doors, grab the handles on buses, shake hands with others, cover our mouths when sneezing…wipe our poop, you know, the works! And we also use our phones with them. And while we wash our hands, we can’t wash our phones, and neither do we bother to clean them with rubbing alcohol or stuff.  There have been surveys, a lot of them regarding the topic. And studies have found that on average, a  toilet seat would have some 220 spots  with bacteria, but a  phone had over 1400 ! Yes, even if you have a case on, you will have bacteria…even more so. And it appears leather cases have the worst end of the stick. They were found to be  over 15 times dirtier than your toilet seat !  However, the bacteria found in our smartphones don’t seem to be very dangerous. As they’re mostly transferred from our hands, which do regular work, most of the bacteria are from our own bodies. But even though, the  bacteria in our smartphones are capable of giving us flu or stomach aches . And while these pathogens are from your own bodies, and might have very less chances of harming you, it is not a good idea to pass around your phones to people.\xa0But of course, how would we share those funny memes without doing that?  Anyways, almost all of us don’t really bother to clean our phones. Even just  simply wiping down your phone with a microfiber cloth  can cut down the amount of bacteria by 40%. And it is advised to clean your phone with a solution of water and rubbing alcohol to get it spick-and-span. But you won’t do that, will you? It’s just too much work. And it has been like this from the very beginning.

['PC builder’s Guide 101: Basics to choosing the right components for your rig'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['December 3, 2018']",2018-12-03 12:25:18+00:00,"['Hi there, we are here to help you with the ultimate PC building guide. By that, we obviously mean a gaming computer because why else would you  build your PC ? But for the sake of it, this PC should also be as useful for a gamer as it will be for someone like a photographer, a video editor or anyone who wants a bit more power than a potato.  But before we jump into it, it’s your job to analyze your budget first. Even if you have a low budget, you can always compromise on a few aspects which you can upgrade at a later date. If you just wanna buy a budget PC, you need to plan beforehand, minimize bottlenecks or cut cost on unnecessary stuff.  With that said, you can find articles on how to choose the right mouse, keyboard,  display , headphones, and controllers on our website, everything else you might need other than a CPU, which we will cover here.        As a guide, anything above 2-3 lakhs, we will call them  high-end (PUBG,\xa0Far Cry 5) , around 1.5-2 lakhs should be  mid-tier (Fortnite, Forza Horizon 4) \xa0and anything under 1 lakh, well let’s just call them a  budget (Fifa 19, Dota 2) \xa0build.  Processor  Processors are pretty much where most people start with. The processor you choose will pivot your decision on choosing the\xa0motherboard, GPU, RAM, cooling solutions and to some extent the case and storage. So, to make it simple Intel has Core i3, Core i5, and the Core i7 processors.\xa0Same goes for AMD’s Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7.   If you were to buy a PC in 2018, something like\xa0a 9900k or a 2700x would be perfect. But even as an amateur enthusiast, I cannot just justify the price. Both of them are exquisitely priced and both perform excellently. If you are someone who by any chance needs these grades of processors, you might wanna look elsewhere.  So, starting off with people who have a reasonable amount of money (high-end) should go for something like an  i7-8700k . The price will vary depending on the sellers, but you can grab one for around 55k. The i7-8700 should do well too and will save you some money, but you will be stuck with a non-unlocked processor.\xa0 For Ryzen lovers, a 2700x\xa0should deliver almost similar levels of performance.  If you wanna\xa0build a mid-tier build, an i5 is the way to go. You can find a  Core i5-8400  for a little under 30k, which should be more than enough given the GPU you will put into this configuration. You can also opt for the 8350K but if you can find one and should cost similar to the 8400, and with overclocking features.  Finally, in case of a budget build, the  i3-8100  is your best option. You can find one for around 17k and is one of the best choices. There are a few Ryzen alternatives but the 8100 just seems like a safer choice.  Cooling  Cooling is a major part of a CPU build and directly reflects on how good your processor performs. The 8700k should be attached to a good cooler, preferably water cooled. Something with a 240mm radiator should do the work and they cost around 20k.  For the 8400, a 120mm (10-13k) radiator should provide an adequate amount of cooling while keeping noise to a minimum. For budget builders, a cooler master hyper 212 Evo should be enough.  Motherboard  This one is pretty easy, as it sole depends on which processor you have chosen. The high-end build with the 8700k works with a  Z370  or a Z390 motherboard. While we are given with an option of backward compatibility, you probably should go with the Z370. One with the tag gaming in its name and inbuilt WiFi will cost you around 30-35k depending on the manufacturer. For those who choose a 2700x, they can get the X370 or an X470.\xa0Mid-tier buyers with the 8400 can go for a basic  Z370 , something basic should be available at around 20k.  For the budget builds with the 8100, the Z370 will work, but a  B360  motherboard will also do, for around\xa014k. All Intel 8th gen processors come with the same sockets, so in general, the Z370 motherboard from any manufacturer will do fine, or even a B360, but the number of features will vary, so as a general rule, go for a motherboard relative to the cost of your processor. The features will include connectivity, future upgradability, feasibility, I/O, durability and all sorts of other semi-luxuries.  PSU (Power Supply Unit)  This one is even simpler, basically, you will need a  700W  PSU for a high end,  600W  for a mid-tier and  500W  for a budget build. Their ratings will also affect the way they work, but that should not be a huge deal other than how much they will cost. Something like a 700W PSU from Thermaltake with RGB will cost around 15k.\xa0As for a 600W, it will cost you around 11k and a 500W comes in at around 8k.   Then comes the PSU rating, which defines the efficiency of the power supply. There are basically six of them, the 80 Plus (white), 80 Plus Bronze (brown), 80 Plus Silver (dark white), 80 Plus Gold (golden), 80 Plus Platinum (slightly less white), and 80 Plus Titanium (even darker white). They prices go up according to their rating, so choose according to your budget. If you ask me, at least get the 80 Plus Bronze, after that, it all your decision.  GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)  If you ever wonder why a gaming PC costs so much, this is why. A GPU is the most expensive component on a PC, and rightfully so as they determine how much refresh rate you get, your graphics quality and which resolutions you can play at. So, choosing the right GPU is the key to great gaming, isn’t it?  Yes, it is, but there is a catch, and it’s named “bottlenecks”. Let’s assume the GTX 1050Ti will throw out 40fps on PUBG at the FHD with highest settings. If you get the GTX 1060, the number will increase to around 55fps at the same settings. If you get the GTX1080 that number will go up to around a 100 frames per second.   Well, that sounds good, isn’t it? Yup, unless your processor bottlenecks your GPU. An RTX2080Ti and the GTX1070 will throw out the same amount of FPS if you put them with a low-end processor like an i3-8100. That is the reason why you need to choose the most graphics performance according to your build without bottlenecking.  For the high-end build with the 8700k, your wallet is your limit. This processor can handle everything from the GTX1080Ti to an RTX2080Ti. Although for the Nepali market, we recommend something like the\xa0 GTX1070 , which will total your price to about 270k.\xa0The GTX1070 goes for a little under 70k in the Nepali market.  As a reference, the GTX1080Ti costs Rs 1.3 lakh, the RTX2080 at 145k and the 1070Ti at about 76k. Priced at 50k, the  GTX1060 \xa0will do fine on our mid-tier i5-8400 build. But if you can spend a bit more, and get the GTX1070, GTX1070Ti or even the GTX 1080, you will face no problems. The cost will be a factor for sure but it will work.  Finally, the\xa0 Nvidia GTX 1050Ti  will be almost perfect for the budget build, which is priced at a little over 30k. The GTX 1060 will also work with the 8100, but above that, there will be a noticeable amount of bottleneck. The GTX1060 is priced higher, so your budget build which should cost about 1 lakh will run much higher, so be prepared.  RAM  According to few experts on the internet, 16GB of RAM is enough for even the most advanced games. With that in mind, we recommend a  16GB 3000MHz  stick for the high-end build. It’s not an overkill, nor is it a bottleneck and the pricing is just right at 30k. However, if you want that smooth killer performance, you won’t go wrong with 32 GB either – that is, if you can cough up the cash.  As for the mid-tier build, we still recommend the same 16GB stick if your budget allows. But if it doesn’t you can get an  8GB 3000MHz  stick for exactly half the price. Yes, I am particularly focusing on the 3000MHz, but if that’s still a bit expensive for you, you can get a 2666MHz unit, but anything below that is a big no.  Budget builders can start at  2400MHz  but we recommend at least  8GB  of RAM if you want usable performance. Going below that will result in frequents stutters, reduced frame rates and just a bad experience overall. You can find one for around 10k to 13k.  Storage  Basically, there are three types of storages; SSD, SSHD, and HDD. Although your storage choices won’t matter much when it comes to your gameplay and fps count, it does affect heavily on your PC’s responsiveness, installation period, app opening times and data transfer speeds. An SSD will be expensive but fast, and an HDD will be slow but cheap, so choose wisely.  So, starting with the high end build, you should get an SSD + HDD combo, giving you the best of speed and storage. This is probably the best configuration one can get, and is recommended for all types of build. A fast  512GB NVMe M.2 SSD  typically costs about 25k. Adding a 1TB 7200RPM hard disk to the configuration will add another 6.5k to your total cost.  While NVMe storage options are fast, a normal SSD is also a viable option. They offer more than double the speeds of a typical hard drive and can still manage to squeeze on your budget. Although if you are going for a small sized normal SSD, a typical 1TB HDD is mandatory for you. You can find a typical normal  256GB SSD \xa0under 10 grand for your mid-tier build, which should be the best choice for you.  For the budget builds, however, this isn’t much of a choice. We recommend you get a  1TB 7200RPM  hard drive\xa0and upgrade it if you want in the future. Maybe you can opt in for a 128GB SSD which is more than enough to store and run your windows off of and won’t cost you a lot either.  Case  Finally, a case is what binds all of your parts together. You can usually find cases for as low as 10k all the way up to who knows how much. Sure, they might serve the same purpose, but the amount of airflow a case allows will result in a much efficient cooling, not to mention the noise levels. Plus, if you are buying top of the line hardware, won’t you wanna show it off?  The size of the case will also be a concern, so check that before you buy it. A mid tower ATX case will be enough for all three types of PC builds. If you have selected all the components and still have money to burn, you can take a look at Full Tower ATX cases, and then throw in some RGB lightings. As a reference, there are a lot of transparent gaming towers that come with extra fans for under 15k.  Conclusion  By now, you should have a slight idea on how to build a PC according to your needs. However, before you do start shopping, do run it by this website  here . It will show you if your components are compatible with each other or if they fit in one another or not and so on.  If you are worried about bottlenecks, you can check that  here . It allows you to check if your GPU works with your CPU and vice versa. Bottlenecks up to 10% are ok, but anything above that is not recommended.  The prices we mentioned above might vary so be prepared for that too. If you are wondering where to assemble one, we stumbled upon two sellers who were good enough to guide us through this guide.

There seem to be 4 variants of the upcoming Samsung flagships, and people can’t seem to stop talking about it. More so, about this new display, being dubbed the  “Infinity O” display . And why not? I think this will be the true edge-to-edge display. A camera hole on the screen instead of a notch. But this feature might make it to another mid-range smartphone before the S-series flagships – on the Samsung Galaxy A8s, to be more precise.  As per rumors, the Samsung Galaxy A8s will launch sometime this month. And it will come with a  19.5:9 aspect ratio screen  with the  camera hole on the top left corner  of the screen. This means that all status bar notifications will shift to the right side. This will give us also more screen real estate without increasing the size of the phone. And this should feel more like the “infinity” on Samsung’s Infinity Display.  But to make phones with true edge-to-edge displays, the 3.5 mm headphone jack will have to be let go of. That’s the design all Samsung fans have been dreading. Not only because we love the headphone jack so much, but Samsung has also been mocking Apple for losing the headphone jack since the  iPhone 7  came out, and now…it seems Samsung will follow the same footsteps.        And since Samsung also stated that it would no longer put new innovative features only on their flagships, but experiment with them on mid-rangers, which will make it to flagships, we can also be sure that the S10 will not have the headphone jack as well. Well, maybe not all variants, but at least one or two of them will. And this makes us question the future of headphone jack on future Samsung phones too.  Back to the topic at hand, reports suggest Samsung Galaxy A8s will sport a  6.39″ Full HD+  display with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Also, a  Snapdragon 710  will power the phone supported by  6 GB of RAM . Also, it will feature  128 GB of storage  and  3400 mAh battery . In addition, the phone might have  triple cameras  at the back too. Furthermore, it will run on  Android 9.0 Pie . Besides that, there isn’t much information to go on.  Now, these are reports and rumors, so, we also can’t say for sure. But, if the A8s really comes with the Infinity O display, we can say goodbye to the beloved headphone jack from Samsung as well.

But just a day ahead of the tweet, massive leaks were found on the internet regarding the specifications and images of the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2 and Max M2. And the short trailer of the phone included on the tweet also showed a lot of similarities. So we can expect many of the features about the phones mentioned on the leaks is going to be true. So let’s dig more into the leaks.        ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 and Max M2 leaked specifications  On the design front, both the handsets feature a similar design language. But when looked into the images in detail, we can see the non-pro variant to have a slightly thicker chin and a narrower chin. We can also notice the Max Pro M2 featuring a glass-sandwich design, whereas the Max M2 have adopted the metallic back approach.  ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2  On the performance front, the Max Pro M1 and the Max M1 were absolutely praise-worthy. And ASUS is going to follow the similar approach in these new handsets. This time ASUS has packed the non-pro variant with a note-worthy Snapdragon 636 chipset. The Max Pro M2 rocks the performance front with the more powerful Snapdragon 660 chipset. In terms of RAM, both the Pro and non-Pro variant will boast 4GB of RAM. However, on the storage front, each of them will grant options with two variants. ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 will have 64GB and 128GB of storage variants whereas the ASUS ZenFone Max M2 will have 32GB and 64GB variants.  ASUS Zenfone Max M2 Back  On the optics front, both of them will rock with dual camera setup at the back. The leaks suggest that the Pro variant will be equipped with 12-megapixel Sony IMX486 primary sensor and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor. The non-Pro variant will have a 13MP primary sensor; however, the information about the secondary sensor is still under the veil.  This time too, we can expect a massive battery on these new handsets. The leak explicitly advises the presence of a 5000mAh battery on the Pro variant. But it failed to quote the exact battery capacity on the Max M2. So we might probably have to wait for its official\xa0unveiling to hear more about the device.  ASUS ZenFone Max M2 display  In terms of display, we will be seeing 6-inch IPS LCD panel on both these handsets enriched with Full-HD+ (2340 x 1080 pixels) resolution. And as mentioned earlier, both of them will have a notch on the top. Although the leaks had not spoken anything about the display protection, ASUS India clearly mentioned that the display on these new phones would have a Corning Gorilla Glass 6 protection.   Watch Mr. James Hollis, Division Vice President at Corning Gorilla Glass talk about how the Gorilla Glass 6 makes the Zenfone Max Pro M2 the most durable smartphone in its segment.  @corninggorilla   #UnbeatablePerformer2dot0   pic.twitter.com/wt5CIGPZyP  — ASUS India (@ASUSIndia)  December 1, 2018   These leaks surely have told a lot about the phones. But until the official unveiling of the device, we cannot be entirely sure about it. So till then, we are obliged to wait.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/asus-zenfone-max-pro-m2-1.jpg']
['MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8RF Review – Ticket to the Lights Show'],"['MSI', 'GE series', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['December 1, 2018']",2018-12-01 14:04:43+00:00,"['We have a festival of lights every year called Tihar. And when that was just around the corner, I got my hands on the  MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8RF  edition. And when I turned it on, my festival of lights started a bit early. The MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8RF is lit! And I mean that literally…  But what else does the MSI GE63 Raider RGB offer besides a light show? Well, the GE-series from MSI aren’t as powerful as their GT siblings. But the idea behind the GE series is to combine higher-end features like the 120 Hz screen, and individually lit keyboard in a more affordable lineup. And on top of that, the GE Raiders don’t compromise on power either.         MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8RF Specifications:   Design and Build: \xa0Metal body, plastic bottom panel, 38.3 x 26 x 2.9 cm, 2.5 kg  Display: \xa015.6″ Full HD (1920 x 1080), 100% sRGB & 85% Adobe RGB, 94% NTSC Color Gamut, 330 nits peak brightness with Anti-Glare  Keyboard:\xa0 Steel-Series Engine 3 Keyboard, Per-key RGB backlighting, 16 million colors, 1.6 mm key travel  Processor: \xa0Hexa-core 8 th \xa0gen i7-8750H processor, Base-Clock @ 2.2 GHz, Turbo Boost Clock up to 4.1 GHz  RAM: \xa0DDR4 16 GB (2x slots, upgradeable up to 32 GB)  Graphics: \xa08 GB NVidia GeForce GTX 1070  Battery: \xa06-cell 51 Watt-hours (up to 3 hours of backup)  Adapter:\xa0 230 Watts  Storage: \xa0256 GB SATA M.2 SSD (2 x NVMe slots) + 1 TB 7200 HDD  Webcam :\xa0 720p Web-cam (@30fps)  Connectivity: \xa0Killer Gb LAN,\xa0802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.0  Ports:  3 x\xa0USB A 3.1, 1 x USB-C (No Thunderbolt 3 support), 1 x 3.5 mm head-phone jack, 1 x 3.5mm microphone input, 1 x HDMI, 1 x Mini-display, 1 x RJ-45 Ethernet,\xa01 x SDcard slot  Price: \xa0Rs.250,000 ($2000 international)    BUY HERE  Design and Build  First things first, the design. Design wise, it’s your typical  MSI gaming laptop . A metallic body with that Red Dragon shield. It is pretty similar to the last generation MSI GE63 Raider…except that this one has the  RGB Mystic Lights on the lid  too! That’s some pretty awesome stuff, and what’s more? These lights are programmable with all the effects of the MSI’s Steel Series individually lit keyboard. And that is very cool!   Besides that, you have a solid metallic build all over. Even the keyboard deck is made out of metal, with only the bottom panel made out of plastic. The metal body all over gives you a great feel of touch. The ventilation is shifted to the underside and and the sides, with large exhausts at the sides and the back of the deck. This laptop, at  2.9 cm  is bulky, but is still ergonomic nonetheless. This unit  weighs some 2.5 kg , and that’s quite heavy to be carried all day long.  The build, with its heft, feels quite sturdy. Though I’ve never had any complaints with MSI’s construction of their laptops. But it is a gaming laptop, with quite a lot of stuff packed inside. And so, I’m still scared of dropping it.\xa0It also packs giant looking speakers underneath that chassis, but giant as though they maybe, the speakers don’t sound as loud as expected from the size.      MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8RF ports   1  of 2               right side         left side                  You get enough ports –  three USB A s, a  USB-C ,  head phone jack ,  HDMI ,  Ethernet  and an  SD card slot . The USB-C doesn’t support Thunderbolt 3, however. There’s a separate input jack for a mic as well. The USB A ports glow red – and besides looking cool, they also help guide you to insert your flash drives in the dark.  Keyboard and Trackpad   This laptop packs the  Steel Series Engine 3 Keyboard , which is built for gaming, and features the individual key lighting. You get over 16 million colors on the keyboard lighting, and there’s a dedicated switch right beside the keyboard beneath the power button to switch effects. There’s also a button to turn the cooler boost on / off as well. The keyboard has a lot of features packed into it, and it can take a while to explore all of it. It’s steel series 3, I probably don’t have to say much about that. But overall, the keys give good feedback, there’s good amount of travel and the typing’s pretty comfortable too.   The trackpad is large and feels nice. It has  Synaptic Drivers , so, the gestures are not very accurate, but overall usage is pretty good, though. The tracking is nice and smooth, and the dedicated hardware buttons feel tactile. No complaints in the keyboard and trackpad department.  Display  The display is another great thing about this laptop. A  15.6” Full HD display  gives you great viewing experience. Add the  120 Hz refresh rate  and a  3 milliseconds of response time  to it, and this becomes one of the fastest laptop screens on the market. Gaming feels very fluid on the screen, and maybe I cannot comprehend all of that, but gamers are gonna feel right at home.   This screen, however, is a  TN LCD panel , but the super fast response time means it has to be a TN panel. But even for that, the image quality is good enough, but due to that very reason, the viewing angles on it are not very good. However, the screen is anti-glare, so, you will face very less problems with any reflections on it.  Everything else about the display is simply great. The color accuracy is there with  100% SRGB . It also has a  94% NTSC Color Gamut  coverage, which is great for gaming and also good enough for editing or such stuff. There’s also the  MSI True Color mode , which claims a 100% Adobe RGB, but of course, that is not quite possible on a 1080 panel. Full brightness measured  around 330 nits , which is a bit better than some other laptops. But still, I’d like it have a little bit more brightness.  Performance  The inclusion of an  8GB GTX 1070 graphics card  is what compliments your fast screen. You also have the latest  8 th  gen Hexa-core i7-8750H processor  combined with  16 GB of RAM . No doubt, it’ll handle any kind of work you throw at it. With this, there’s no such thing as too many tabs on your browser, or too many apps open or things like that. Heavy applications like Adobe Photoshop or Premiere run without any kind of stutters whatsoever.  \xa0  Also, with a  256 GB SATA M.2 SSD  and a  7200 RPM 1 TB HDD , your storage needs are pretty well covered.The laptop actually has  two NVMe slots , but packs SATA drives. Still, the SSD that comes with it gives you good enough read write speeds. On our tests, it gave us up to  2606 MB/s of read speeds  and  1189.7 MB/s write speeds .  Gaming on this laptop is also amazing! You get a good amount of Frames per second even with quite Graphic Intensive Games like The Witcher 3 and Fortnite on Ultra Settings. Lesser graphic intensive games like Dota 2 or CS:GO are even better…it just does everything well! There is also a GTX 1060 variant available, but if you want the most out of games, then go for the GTX 1070.   As usual, MSI’s tuning and monitoring software, the  Dragon Center  is also here on the GE63 Raider. With this pre-installed program, you can adjust system performance, keyboard lighting, power settings, fan behavior, and display values. From there, you can set how you use your laptop – in low power mode, or performance boost, or such.  There are various modes on the cooling fans as well. Mostly, and advanced cooling options will do the work too, but if you hit the cooler boost option, it can give you the best frame rates on your gaming or while doing something intense like rendering a video. This is quite a nice touch, and the fact that you can do it with a single button on the side makes it even better.  Thermals  The thermals on this laptop are pretty good as well. The temperature levels it can get to can be large sometimes, but even with that, there is very less thermal throttling, which are not really noticeable. Even with the cooler boost on, the highest external temp we recorded was a 50.4-degree centigrade while playing Witcher 3, but there was no throttling whatsoever. It seems the large  Cooler Boost 5 system  with  dual fans  and  seven heat pipes  do their job really well.  Battery Life  The battery on the laptop is poor though. It has a  6-cell 51 Watt-hour battery , which is pretty small considering the laptop’s size. Few gaming laptops give you a battery life that last you a day, and this is no different. It gives you about  45 minutes of gaming time  on high settings and with the lighting on, and about  2 and half hours on regular usage . You absolutely have to carry the charger around with you, and that thing is also pretty heavy.  Verdict   If you want to talk about the negative aspects of the laptop, you kinda have to nitpick on the small things, but this laptop does the major parts pretty well. It is a very powerful laptop that has great regular and gaming performance. The display is a good one, too, and there is no thermal throttling whatsoever. It is only the small stuff that’s lagging behind. For example, the metallic build and texture is great, but it catches your finger smudges easily, and are difficult to get rid of.  And maybe people rarely notice the web-cam on gaming laptops, but the  720p web-cam  on this laptop sucks. The quality is muddy and pretty much unusable. Also, the speakers on this thing aren’t as good as expected from a laptop of this caliber.\xa0 Now I already talked about the viewing angles on the TN panel. So, while I’m at it, this laptop is pretty hard to open up. Inside, this laptop has two NVMe slots with one SATA drive, and two RAM slots, which makes  quite the room for upgrades . But this thing is very hard to open, so if you do want to upgrade it, you have to be extra careful.  So, that’s pretty much it about the MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8RF. Some small stuffs might bother you, but other than that, every thing major about it is just good. And on top, the RGB Mystic Lights are sweet icing on the cake.  But of course, such a laptop won’t come cheap. This beast costs about  $2000 dollars  internationally, and  Rs.250,000 in Nepal . But I believe that if you want a great gaming laptop, why not go all out? You get top of the line performance with the fastest screen around, and of course, a light show of your very own!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msi-ge63-raider-rgb-8rf-review.jpg']

Because of the alluring design and the selfie-centric approach, the smartphone brand managed to accumulate a respectable market share in Nepali smartphone market. Till now, the company had been selling F-series midrangers and A-series budget phones. But the company is now hoping to expand its horizon. And its plans of introducing the flagship R-series smartphone directly reflects its intentions.  Lately, we have seen a lot of innovations from the Oppo. Be it a teardrop display on the  Oppo F9  or a pop-up camera module in the  Oppo Find X , the smartphone it awe-inspired us greatly in 2018. But long before these innovations, Oppo’s R-series smartphones had already made their mark in the smartphone world. In 2014, Oppo launched the Oppo R5, which the company boasted to be the thinnest smartphone yet with a mere thickness of 4.85mm. In such a thin stature, the smartphone maker had also managed to inject some top-of-the-line gaming hardware to make it an ultimate gaming phone of that time. Oppo also collaborated with a gaming studio to create a game so that it could educate the users about the gaming potential of the device.  Oppo R9s  is yet another unforgettable Oppo phone. This smartphone was the bestselling smartphone in the world last year. On Singles’ day in 2017, this camera-centric device stood out as the best selling handset on the Tmall, which is one of the most popular e-commerce websites in China.        It does not end there. The R9s surely have taken ages to gain the title of the bestselling smartphone of the world. But another Oppo smartphone, which goes by the name  Oppo R11  clenched the title of the World’s number one Android phone in less than four weeks.

Well, DJI said “Hold my beer”, and came up with the DJI Osmo Pocket. This device is a combination of a 4K camera and a gimbal that fits in your pocket!  This device is quite small in size – only  4 inches tall . But within that, it packs a  12 MP 1/2.3″ sensor  with  f/2.0 aperture, \xa0and a  1″ touchscreen . The camera has an  80-degree field-of-view  and can record  4K videos at 60fps , similar to  DJI’s Mavic Air  or the  Mavic Pro . Those who are familiar with any of those devices might know what to expect from the DJI Osmo Pocket.         The Osmo Pocket also features  Dual Mics  for recording audio. Now, we don’t know what kind of audio from a small device such as this, but DJI’s never let us down. The camera sensor is also no bigger than what we see on the smartphone cameras of today, but the  3-axis stabilizer gimbal  offers far more superior stabilization than any seen on any kind of smartphones.\xa0In addition, the Osmo Pocket also offers many of DJI’s advanced shooting modes on this small device – like object tracking, face tracking, time-lapse, and auto-panorama.  This means that you can get drone like footage in the size of a GoPro. But of course, GoPros can handle a lot more wear-and-tear than drones can. But this  costs only about $350 , and for all of this, it looks like a great little device.  This small gimbal-camera-stabilizer also packs an  875 mAh battery , that can last slightly more than 2 hours while recording on 4K at 30fps. On the touchscreen, you can easily toggle through your settings and frame your recordings. And yes, the 1″ screen doesn’t make for great visibility, but you can also connect your phones to it via a USB-C or Apple’s lightning port with an interchangeable mod on the side.\xa0With that, you can get better access to your recordings and better controls, using the company’s new app.  This device is available for pre-order as of now and will start shipping sometime in mid-December. The company also plans to sell various accessories for the Osmo Pocket, like a mount, Wi-Fi controller, water-proof case, etc. You can find more information about this neat little device on the  company’s official site .']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DJI-Osmo-Pocket-launched.jpg']

And as the title suggests, it is none other than the Gionee itself. Over the years, the smartphone maker had gained quite a goodwill because of its camera-centric and big-battery oriented devices. But the manufacturer is facing downfall as it had been unable to pay the money it owed to its financial institutions, suppliers, and advertising and marketing agencies. \xa0Adding all the money it owes, the company now has the debt of around CNY 17 billion, which translates to $2.45 billion. And the gambling habit of its chairman Liu Lirong seems responsible for this sudden collapse of the organization.  The company managed to sell around 40 million units of Gionee handsets in 2016. All thanks to the company’s cost-effective backed by an advertising campaign endorsed by top celebrities, the brand managed to garner quite a lot of popularity. Gionee had also been ranked on the sixth position, just behind the Apple in terms of handset sales last year. But now the company is on the verge of bankruptcy and Chairman Li Lirong takes the entire blame for the scenario created.  Li Lirong has accepted that the company owes a total of 17 billion Yuan. And on that 17 billion Yuan debt, it owes 10 billion Yuan to the banks, 5 billion Yuan to upstream suppliers and about 2 billion to advertising agencies. The Chairman also stated that his gambling losses were around $1 billion. He also accepted using company funds for his personal benefits.

['Lenovo K5 Play Review: A Powerful Budget Smartphone with a Soury Software'],"['Lenovo', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['November 29, 2018']",2018-11-29 12:00:12+00:00,"['It has already been two years since I last reviewed a smartphone from Lenovo. So, I was really excited when I got my hands on the  Lenovo K5 Play . This phone falls on the budget segment, the area which is more competitive now than ever! So, in this review, I will be talking about the aspects that I really liked, and some that I didn’t, and I hope it will help you choose the right device!  Lenovo K5 Play Specifications:   Design:\xa0 Polymer Glass  Display:\xa0 5.7″ IPS LCD display with HD+ resolution (720 x 1440 pixels)  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual Camera setup, 13 MP with f/2.2 aperture + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera:\xa0 8 MP with f/2.0 aperture  Chipset:\xa0 Octa-core Snapdragon 430 chip  RAM:\xa0 3 GB  Platform:\xa0 Android 8.0 Oreo  Storage:\xa0 32 GB internal (expandable up to 128 GB via microSD  Battery:\xa0 3030 mAh  Price in Nepal:\xa0 Rs.17,999   Design   The first thing you notice about a smartphone is the looks. And the K5 Play, for me, kind of nails the looks. This blue color I have here looks great with that glass-like back. Yeah-yeah, I know this is plastic, and metal backs feel more premium, but take a note of that price. I think this design will appeal to many.        The compact form makes the device easy to browse around, and the texture on the power button makes the phone just easy to use. I really like smartphones that carry a weight, and even with the plastic body, the K5 Play feels comfortable on the hands, unlike other plastic devices.  Display   There is still a shortcoming here, though. Lenovo has transformed the screen to 18:9 aspect ratio, and although the bezels have been shrunk down, I still think this is nowhere near the bezel-less craze smartphones are following these days.  These bezels have sandwiched a 5.7-inch display in between themselves. Yes, this is a 720p panel, and yes, it isn’t that sharp, but I have liked it nonetheless. It gets quite bright, and the colors are reproduced nicely. There is ample saturation, and I have really enjoyed watching multimedia contents on this phone.  Hardware and Security   However, the sound that comes off while watching contents on the Lenovo K5 Play isn’t that loud. There is a single downward facing speaker on the phone, and like all other budget phones, that sound it produces is not that pleasing. But you can’t expect much for the price, can you?  On the back of the phone resides a fingerprint scanner that works 100% of the time but is kind of slow. And unlike the S5 which it was launched alongside, the phone lacks the face unlock feature.  In terms of memory, the device features 32 GB of onboard memory that is expandable up to 128 GB via a microSD card slot.  Performance  Even with the budget price, the Lenovo K5 Play has done well in terms of its performance. With the Snapdragon 430 and 3 GB RAM inside of it, the phone handled my normal usage that consisted of browsing through social media, web pages, and playing the lighter games.  I even tested PUBG on it. I had no expectations with it when I ran the game for the first time, but to my surprise, it did well. Yes, there are lags and frame drops, but it still does a respectable job. And even though Johnson had some issues with running Asphalt 9 on the  Xiaomi Redmi 6 , I played the game on the K5 Play, and there weren’t any noticeable lags.  So, I am confident when I say this, the Lenovo K5 Play is one of the best performing budget smartphones of 2018!  Software   However, this well-performing smartphone is soured by the software. Two years ago, I had praised Lenovo for the software its smartphones run on. And I was kind of hoping the same with the K5 Play, but that was not really the case.  We are now at a time where the skins on top of Android equip a lot of customizations that help with the overall user interface. While some of those customizations are gimmicky, I still like a lot of them. It helps to make the phone easier to use. And like those OEMs, Lenovo too has made its own version of a customized skin that packs in a couple of extra features. But the major disappointment was the swipe up for the control center. Clearing the notification is kind of weird too. You can only swipe in one direction to clear it. And just to add your own personal wallpaper you must toggle the HD desktop wallpaper option.  I also haven’t been able to change the Sleep time interval of the display. Whenever I tap on the sleep button, the settings app just restarts.  Camera   Let’s talk about the cameras now. During night time, the pictures that come out of the dual cameras on the back are kind of a mess. They lack the colors and saturation and have noise written all over them.             The cameras also find it hard to focus properly, which results in blurred out shots some time. The selfie camera also finds it hard to take good pictures, and here is a picture to support that claim.   The results in a well-lit environment, however, contradict the night-time ones. The color reproduction is done nicely here, and even when you zoom into the pictures, there are ample details. The shadow details are preserved in the images.             The saturation is near to natural too. Lenovo was a well-known brand for making smartphones with good cameras, and I think that hasn’t changed this time around.          The portraits from the dual cameras are good too. Here is one without the blur and one with it. I mean this surely doesn’t look like a portrait from a budget device.   The selfies, however, could have been better. They are what you would call “social media ready” but the colors, though, they aren’t popping. Also, the background is a little overexposed at times. The same goes for the videos as they are a lot shaky, although the details and colors are quite nice.  Battery   The other area that I like about the K5 Play is the battery life. Even with my heavy usage, the phone gave me a screen on time of around 4 hours and twenty minutes. So, if you are a light user, you can expect it to run for a day straight, probably with more than 5 hours of screen-on-time!  Conclusion  So, what do I make of the K5 Play? Well, it’s a well-performing smartphone with a good camera. It even runs the graphics-heavy games, and the dual cameras on the back are not just a gimmick. And although there is still that unpolished software inside, which I do not like at all, the phone feels like it’s a good investment if you are looking for a budget smartphone.

Huawei Y9 2019   Although its name suggests 2019, The  Huawei Y9 2019  is another great mid-range handset of 2018.

This is a phone that doesn’t excel in any particular aspect but performs well enough in all aspects. An average all-rounder, so to speak.        This phone was introduced for Rs.34,900 here.

Offer Price: Rs. 31,490   Huawei Nova 2 Lite   Also known as the Huawei Y7 Prime 2018 internationally, the  Nova 2 Lite  can be categorized in the budget segment. It features an HD+ display with no notch, average cameras, and an average processor too. But it does have a shiny body that makes for a somewhat appealing looks.  This phone that costs Rs.23,900 is available, now, for Rs.21,990. With the offer though, it could be a good purchase.

And it made debut alongside the Nova 2 Lite as well. It features an HD display, 8 MP rear camera and has low internal specs. However, it does have a good battery.

['Lenovo S5 review: Everything is just ‘okay’!'],"['Lenovo', 'Reviews']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['November 28, 2018']",2018-11-28 11:06:53+00:00,"['While Lenovo phones were popular some few years ago, we don’t hear the name very often now. But the company has made a come back here in Nepal with the Lenovo S5 and K5 Play. Today we have the Lenovo S5 – a phone that falls into the lower mid-range segment, with its price tag of Rs.26,999. Granted that this is a phone from some 6 months ago, some of the things might be a little outdated. But can it still stand against the phones of today? Let’s find that out in this Lenovo S5 review.  Lenovo S5 Specifications   Design:\xa0 Full Metal design  Display:\xa0 5.7″ IPS LCD Full HD+ Max Vision Display (1080\xa0 x 2160) resolution  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual lens setup, 13 MP primary with f/2.2 aperture + 13 MP monochrome sensor  Front Camera:\xa0 16 MP lens with f/2.2 aperture  Chipset:\xa0 Octa-core Snapdragon 625  RAM:\xa0 4 GB  Platform:\xa0 Android 8.0 Oreo  Storage:\xa0 64 GB (expandable up to 128 GB via microSD, hybrid slot)  Battery:\xa0 3000 mAh  Price in Nepal:\xa0 Rs.26,999   Also read:  Lenovo Mobiles Price in Nepal  Design:  The first thing that you will notice about this device is the looks of it. There is nothing much striking about it, although it does resemble some  Xiaomi phones . It’s an all-metal unibody construction with an aluminum frame surrounding the sides. And though the phone is not a glass body, it does look and feel good on hands. I have the black version here but there is also a red version available.         As for the aesthetics, you get a clean look at the back, Dual cameras, an LED light, a fingerprint sensor, and the Lenovo branding. The looks seem minimalistic but the ever so slight protruding cameras cause some imbalance when the phone is kept upside down. Looking at the front, it’s evident that there is no notch game going on and honestly, I don’t mind that. The phone is slim and well does not ditch the headphone jack here. Down below, you get the single speaker grill, the primary microphone and the USB type C input which I am happy to see.   Up front, at the top, you get the speaker input, proximity and light sensors along with the selfie camera. Similarly, the right handles the placement of the power button and volume rockers along with having the SIM tray/ MicroSD card slot on the left.  Display:   The display measures 5.7 inches and well, has an 18:9 aspect ratio which is a standard all smartphones follow. But the bezels surely take away the charm of an edge to edge display from this phone. But the display that has a resolution of 2160 x 1080 pixels does justice to the price. The display is colorful, vibrant and sharp. However, during the review time, I have always wished it provide me better sunlight visibility.  The design and display department of this phone is okay. I mean, it’s not excellent but it’s not bad either.  Performance and Storage and Software  For the price, the Lenovo S5 does well with performance too. You get the SD 625 chipset along with Adreno 506 GPU and well this combination works good enough. PUBG is playable at low settings and it ran well with only a few stutters. And also, the phone handles gameplay well even on the heating aspect. But battery drainage is an issue during long hours of gaming. However, it’s the same in almost all the phones so, there is not much to complain. Multitasking is fast enough although app opening is not blazing fast. Navigating through is also smooth enough.  But, I cannot not mention the fact that for a similar price, you get the  Mi A2 Lite  with Stock Android which brings me to the Software side of things. Well, the phone has ZUI on top of Android and I feel that it is yet to mature to a fully functioning good UI.        1  of 5               multitasking bar         lenovo s5 home screen         lenovo s5 no app drawer         lenovo s5 notification center         lenovo s5 control center                           What I mean by that is, some features it has of the iOS and some of Android and the combination is not very appealing to use. The upward swiping action center is confusing because most of the times I have just wanted to put on the navigation keys. Similarly, the notifications can only be deleted if you swipe towards the left, which is again very confusing. I have used this device for almost 2 weeks now and I am still having difficulties getting used to it.   In the storage department, you get 4GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage which is what we expect for the price so no complaints here as well.   While we are still talking about the performance, the fingerprint sensor is a bit slower than what I have been experiencing on other phones. Although the sensor gets it correct 9 out of 10 times. Likewise, the touch sensitivity is not that great either, I had some light touch times and the S5 did not receive it well.  The speaker at the bottom is just average. Good news is that it has a notification LED light but only glows in altogether 3 colors, so my notifications were not missed.  Battery:  The phone comes with a 3,000 mAh battery that is enduring and will back you up for a day. However, gameplay results to massive battery drainage and will leave you juiceless on intensive prolonged gaming. On normal use, the battery fares well. It takes you over two get it fully running which is a pretty long time. However, you get a USB Type C here which is something missing on even some phones priced more than this one.  Cameras:   Cameras on this one is a mixed bag. Sometimes, you get good results and sometimes, you just lose hope. Most of the times, good lighting conditions result in good pictures. The annoying part is that the images take a lot of time to process. To be exact, it takes around 2-3 seconds to produce an image, which means you will have to be very patient. But the image quality is not bad by any means. The images do lack a bit of punch but the detailing is good enough. If you are wondering what the megapixel count on this one is, it’s a 13 MP shooter at the back with another 13 MP Monochrome sensor. Black and white pictures look good but I wished it could be a depth sensor.      Lenovo S5 Back camera samples   1  of 4                                                          There is a portrait mode too but the depth sensing is purely software and well, they are just okay. But you can adjust the intensity of blurs after taking pictures, so that’s cool.      Lenovo S5 Portrait image samples   1  of 4                                                          Night shots are grainy and noisy and if your hands are not stable enough, you could get your images to be shaky.   As for the selfies, they look good in good lighting conditions, when the lighting becomes darker, you will start noticing grains in your pictures. Here are a few samples for you to judge.  For high-resolution samples, click  here\xa0  You can see in the pictures, they are not that punchy but the selfies don’t look bad. So, the 16 MP selfie camera fares well enough.      Lenovo S5 selfie samples   1  of 3                                                Talking about the videos, you can record videos up to 4k, however, they are not that stabilized. The autofocus does not work very properly either.  Conclusion:  So, to conclude, I would say that the Lenovo S5 is an okay phone overall. What I mean by this is all the aspects of this one are neither extraordinarily good nor strikingly bad. It can give you a performance that is “okay” in all aspects.  However, it is also worth considering that there are other options from Xiaomi that might give tough competition to this one. The Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite and Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI would be some phones challenging this one. However, anyone buying this phone will not regret in overall usage. However, I am not a fan of the software though!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/lenovo-s5-review.jpg']

Mostly, because of their affordable phones with good internal specs. And after a series of Realme phones, a new one has surfaced. Known as the Realme U1, this phone is the first to feature the new  MediaTek\xa0Helio P70 chipset .  OPPO Realme U1 Overview  And since it is from OPPO, it is not surprising that this one is a selfie-centric phone. Well, the other Realme phones may not have been as selfie-centric, but it’s OPPO. So, to include a good selfie camera is a given. Anyways, the design is more-or-less very similar to the  Realme 2 Pro . And the display as well, with the same  6.3″ Full HD+ LTPS IPS LCD panel  with the  tear-drop notch , the phone looks quite identical.  In terms of camera, the rear camera consists of a  13 MP primary sensor with f/2.2 aperture  and a  2 MP depth sensor . The rear camera setup seems inferior to the Realme 2 Pro’s and with a narrow f/2.2 aperture, I don’t expect much from the rear camera. However, as aforementioned, the selfie camera is a big  25 MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture . And with this, we can be pretty confident that it will take great selfies.        Underneath, the  Helio P70  powers this phone. This is the first phone to have this chipset, and it is the upgrade to the  Helio P60 , which was a good mid-range chipset. The Helio P70 claims  better clock-speed enhancements , feature enhancements, and  better power efficiency . Other than that, it also claims a steady 60 fps in gaming via optimizations, which is good as the only 60 fps you’ll see on this phone are in the gaming department (because there is  no 60 fps video recording  of any kind). Also, the new chipset also monitors the power usage and temperature constantly. But only time will tell if its claims hold up.  As for the Realme U1, it comes in two RAM / storage configurations:  3 GB / 32 GB  and  4 GB / 64 GB  options. Also, there’s a dedicated microSD card slot for your storage expansion needs. The phone has a  good-sized 3500 mAh battery , but there is  no fast-charging  whatsoever. But, it still retains the  3.5 mm headphone jack , and FM Radio. In addition, the phone will run on the  ColorsOS 5.2  on top of Android 8.1.  The phone launched in India for  INR. 12000 (US $170)  for the 3/32 GB and  INR. 15000 for the 6/64 GB . The Realme brand is, right now, only available in India, and so, won’t be launching in Nepal anytime soon. But what do you think of this phone? Do let us know.

Fast forward a few weeks,  Huawei  looks set to emulate one of those displays on a new smartphone. The smartphone, rumored to be named the Nova 3S will be among the first devices to feature this sort of display cut-out.  2018 has seen the trend of mobile phones featuring a high screen-to-body ratio with a number of devices going absolutely bezel-less. Complying with that trend, Samsung had only recently unveiled designs of display that have three types of notches.  Huawei has just released a teaser on one of its social media account citing a smartphone launch for December. What’s more interesting here is the sparkling light on the top right corner of the device. This design certainly reminds us of the Infinity-O display.        This design looks very similar to the renders of the Galaxy A8s which will have the same cut out to equip the selfie camera, according to various leaks. Up until now, Samsung has always stuck with no cutouts for its display, so it will be interesting to see how the company moves here onwards.  We have already seen OEMs implement various types of displays on their smartphones. The  Oppo F9 ,  Vivo V11 , and  OnePlus 6T  have the waterdrop-like notch while there are also devices with the sliding mechanism like the  Oppo Find X ,  Lenovo Z5 Pro ,  Huawei Magic 2 Slider  and  Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 .  It will be interesting to see how the public reacts to this new smartphone from Huawei, as a lot of people have been waiting to see the end of notches on smartphones.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/huawei-display-hole-camera.jpg']

['Apple suffers declining iPhone sales: Restarted iPhone X production & slashed iPhone XR price'],"['Apple', 'iPhone']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['November 25, 2018']",2018-11-25 03:50:32+00:00,"['Apple became the first trillion dollars company recently. The milestone cues the formidable stature of the company. However, the sales of the recent iPhones say otherwise. Lately, Apple’s sales are going downhill. It already has been two months of the launch of the new iPhones. However, the sales are not going the way the silicon-based tech titan expected. So to promote the sales, Apple restarted the production of the  iPhone X  and slashed the price of  iPhone XR  in certain regions.  iPhone X production  During the announcement of the  iPhone XS and XS Max , the company declared the discontinuation of the iPhone X. Except for the chipset and OS, there were no any major differences between the iPhone X and iPhone XS. Probably that could be the reason for launching the new iPhone XS at the price of the iPhone X.  So Apple hasn’t been true to its words. But according to the rumors flying around in the tech community, there are two broad reasons. The first reason suggests that the tech giant is facing a huge blow in terms of sales. So many people believe that this step of Apple is to supplement the sales and revenue and to meet the target.        Apple surely is a profit-oriented company. But a company of that stature may not go against its words just to increase its sales. So the second reason suggests that the company is being obliged to restart the production. The rumor elaborates that Apple had a contract with Samsung to purchase certain units of Super AMOLED displays for the iPhone X. But in the one year’s time, Apple did not make use of all the contracted amount of display units from Samsung. So due to the mere obligation of Apple to use the contracted number of Super AMOLED displays from Samsung, Apple had to restart the iPhone X production.  iPhone XR Price Drop  iPhone XR is the most affordable iPhone of this year. Cutting some premium specs of the iPhone XS and XS Max, Apple tried to make the iPhone XR somewhat budget-friendly. Despite the affordable nature, the XR was still powerful in many aspects than its competitors. Also, Apple released the XR in many variants of colors to lure the customers and hence to create an upsurge in sales. But sadly, things did not go as planned and on the favor of Apple. Since there are a lot of capable smartphones (mostly Chinese) available at similar or a lower price than the iPhone XR, people shifted their attention to the other phones.  With two months passed already, this kind of decline in sales can be really disastrous for Apple. And if things go like this, it would be even harder to compete with other smartphones when the calendar hits 2019. So the company slashed the price of iPhone XR in certain regions to lure people into iPhones and finally to create an upsurge in its sales.  A few months ago, Huawei surpassed Apple in terms of sales. And Huawei’s sales is going uphill. Other Chinese companies like OnePlus and Xiaomi are also making quite an impact in the smartphone market with their value for money phones. This can worsen the things even more for Apple. So due to the overpricing nature of Apple, the company seems to be losing its grip on the smartphone. But with these stunts, can Apple discourage the declining sales?

But how does this smartphone really fares when it comes to real life usage? Find out in this Samsung Galaxy A9 2018 review.   Camera  Since the cameras are the major highlight of the phone, let’s begin the review with the camera. As mentioned earlier, the phone carries a quad camera setup at the back. Accompanying the primary shooter, there are three additional lenses – each one doing a unique task. So let me explain each one of them.        The topmost camera among the four is an ultra-wide angle lens. This camera lens is an 8MP sensor and a f/2.4 aperture. It basically extends the field-of-view up to 120-degrees, just as wide as the pair of human eyes can see.  The second camera on the Galaxy A9 is the telephoto lens. Paired with a 10MP sensor and f/2.4 aperture, this camera promises to capture images with 2x zooming without any loss in the image quality.   The primary shooter lies on the third from the top. It is equipped with a 24MP sensor and a wide f/1.7 aperture. The major purpose of the wide aperture is to let in a plenty of light into the sensor which helps capture amazing images even in the low light settings.  The last one is a 5 MP depth-sensor with f/2.2 aperture. Now, you all know what a depth sensor does – highlighting the subject and blurring the background to give portrait images with bokeh effects.  Yes, the phone seems to have all sorts of lenses. And so, I had all sorts of expectations from it. But it was a huge blow when I took photos. The primary camera, despite being rich on the megapixel count with a 24MP resolution, couldn’t quite pack sufficient details into the images. It wasn’t the case all the time but I also had problems while focusing on the subject. And that’s not all, some of the captured images even had slightly inaccurate colors.

The already not-so-sharp images lose details further with noise and what not. And some of the images were absolutely useless.

The ultra-wide angle lens also did not fare any better. It, too, lacked the punch when it comes to details. I also noticed a slight change in color temperature in the images from the primary camera and the ultra-wide camera. The captured images also seem to have a fish-eye effect with a slight visual distortion near the edges due to which the images quite look slightly hemispherical.

But adding insult to the injury, the telephoto camera dejected me further. Although Samsung claims it can shoot with lossless zooming, the captured photos said otherwise.

I captured a fair amount of portrait images. Just look at these portraits, you can yourself observe the jittery edge detection and unnatural blurs. Yes, it has the option to select the focus area and the blur intensity; it still was hard to obtain a decent portrait image sometimes.

So, the Quad camera setup on this phone looks simply appears to be a gimmick and nothing more than a stunt – which, they failed. We have seen Samsung making compromises on other aspects of the phone previously, but never on the camera front. \xa0The A9 failed to bring decent results on my tests, and this was a hard truth to swallow.  So I thought to reach out to Samsung, thinking that this may be a faulty review unit. And promptly, I was told that the review units everyone is getting are betas, i.e. not fully functioning well. I was told that the retail units, which would go to the customers, would have polished software and won’t have such kind of issues. But during the review period, the phone was not available for sale to the customers and I couldn’t check the differences. When they do become available, we might have to perform an in-depth camera review for everyone out there if Samsung indeed delivers as promised. But for now, it is what it is.   Continuing with the camera, there is also a 24MP selfie camera on the front, which, unlike the rear camera captures amazing images. And this is also why I refused to believe that the rear cameras are the way they are. There is also a selfie focus feature to capture the portrait selfies. Since there is just a single camera on the front, software does all the works on blurring the background. So the portrait selfies lack proper edge detection but it was decent enough for my liking. I sincerely hope, for the sake of Samsung fans, and Samsung themselves, that the retail units do perform better than these.

Design and Build  Now, let’s dive into some other aspects of the phone. When it comes to design, the Galaxy A9 looks absolutely stunning. It comes with a tall and sleek body wrapped in a plastic back and reinforced with a metallic frame. A plastic body on a premium mid-ranger surely does not sound appealing. But it is so cleverly crafted that it gives a feel of a glass back. And while holding the phone during my usage, it offered me a premium impression.   All the buttons are on the right, at least all the important ones, anyway. The dedicated Bixby button is on the left, which I accidentally pressed countless times often being mistaking it with the volume button. I don’t use it much, and I can’t think of anyone who does either. But the sad part it is, it neither can be turned off nor can be remapped. So you have to learn to live with that!  At the back, the fingerprint sensor is at a good location. Just where my finger rests while holding a smartphone. So, unlocking the device wasn’t a problem for me at all.  Display  On the display front, the phone comes with a 6.3-inch Full-HD+ display featuring a Super AMOLED panel. With a Super AMOLED panel at disposal, the contents on the handset look lively with appreciable contrast ratio. Viewing angles and color accuracy are also impressive. During the review, I got a chance to compare it with the  OnePlus 6  and in the comparison, I did not find any major differences. That definitely cues a premium quality display. So Kudos to Samsung!   Furthermore, the screen on the phone is also sufficiently bright and I did not have any issues even while viewing the contents even on a bright sunny day. But the thing that bugged me on this phone is the absence of notification LED lights. This phone, however, has “Always On display” feature as a replacement for that. But this feature does not quite alert the users about the notifications and it also consumes a considerable amount of power than the notification LEDs. So the replacement did not quite console me. And all this even with bezels on the phone is questionable.   Performance  As for the performance, the phone is powered by the  Snapdragon 660 chipset  and is not bad by any means. But since the OnePlus is offering a  Snapdragon 845 chipset  on a smartphone available at a somewhat similar price and Xiaomi offering the same chipset on a smartphone half the price of this phone, the choice of the chipset on the A9 2018 did not please me.  But, what did please me was the generosity in the memory side. The phone has a good 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage. On top of it, there is a dedicated SD card to expand the storage further.   So with plenty of RAM at the helm and a decent chipset on board, the phone performs remarkably well. Multitasking and switching between apps is also blazing fast. Similarly, while playing games, the phone does not sigh with the fatigue. Playing light games was a breeze on this phone.  It did try to maintain the consistency even while playing graphics intensive games but hadn’t been quite successful. Although the counts were minimum, I noticed lags and stutters, which occurred mainly while playing Asphalt 9 in high settings and PUBG in medium settings. Considering the price, it’s not very convincing.  Software and UI  The Galaxy A9 2018 comes with the Android Oreo out of the box with Experience UI on the top as usual. Like all the other Samsung smartphones, this one too comes with tons of bloatware. But since most of them can be disabled or uninstalled, there is nothing much to worry about.  But what did bug me was the inclusion of Android 8.0 Oreo on the phone. Since the phone was launched after the rollout of the stable version of  Android Pie , I was hopeful about the phone receiving the latest software, which is not the case here. But maybe, the retail units, like Samsung claims, will come out with Android Pie or, if not, the phone might receive one pretty soon. Until then, it’s fingers crossed.  Battery  The aspect, where the Galaxy A9 2018 shines is on the battery front. The phone rocks with a massive 3800mAh battery, that’s truly respectable. Since the A9 2018 features an efficient processor and a low power consuming display, it does really well when it comes to backup. The phone lasts easily for a day and a half on normal use. I always ended up with 35 to 40% at the end of the day. So I am entirely satisfied with the backup.  The phone also comes with a quick charging support. Although it is marketed as fast charging, it was not fast enough for my liking. The handset takes around 1 hour and 40 minutes to get the battery fully charged. So when it comes to charging speed, the phone lags behind the smartphones like  OnePlus 6T  and  Vivo V11 Pro  by a huge margin.  Verdict  To sum it up, the A9 2018 is really a great device. It has got the fancy design, capable chipset, remarkable display, and a respectable battery life. On the camera department, we couldn’t pass a solid judgment. But even if the cameras were great as Samsung promised, the phone still doesn’t make sense at this price despite having so many great features already. At a similar price, if you can buy the OnePlus 6T, which is better than the Galaxy A9 2018 in almost every aspect. So why settle for the A9?

But Vivo recently slashed the price of the  Vivo V11 . So this is going to be a permanent price drop. And at the new price, the handset has become the most affordable smartphone in Nepal to come up with a whopping 128GB of storage. Other specs of the smartphone is pretty good as well. So this Vivo V11 price drop seems to bring a strong competition among the mid-range smartphones in Nepal.   Vivo V11 Overview  When it comes to looks, Vivo V11 is really appealing. It comes in three color variants: Starry Night, Dazzling Gold, and Nebula. All these colors complement the design of the phone pretty well. So the handset looks absolutely stunning. This gorgeous smartphone is equipped with a 6.3-inch IPS display, which features Full-HD+ resolution. The display on the device comes in 19:9 aspect ratio with a notch on the top. The notch on the Vivo V11 is really tiny. And with this little notch, the display on it looks more or less similar to the waterdrop display on the  Oppo F9 . Vivo likes to call the display on the device as a Halo display. With the pixel density of 400PPI, this so-called Halo display looks sufficiently sharp.         On the performance front, the phone comes with  MediaTek Helio P60 chipset  accompanied by 4GB of RAM. And as mentioned earlier, the phone flaunts a massive 128GB of storage, which is absolutely respectable at its price. In addition, there is an SD card slot to expand the storage further.  Like all the Vivo phones, Vivo V11 is also a camera-centric smartphone. The phone enjoys a dual camera setup at the back, which comprises of a 16MP and 5MP sensors. Upfront, there is a 25MP camera dedicated for the selfies.   On the software front, the phone comes with Android Oreo with FunTouch OS on the top. Vivo V11 also features a 3400mAh non-removable battery to supply the power juice to the phone.

Six months after the launch of the  Honor 10 , we now have the Honor 10 Lite – a phone that is targeted towards the younger audience, or so they claim. The Honor 10 Lite is slightly different than the Honor 10 in terms of design, and in internals, it matches the  Honor 8X . But the major difference is the new fancy gradient colors they’re flaunting.   Honor 10 Lite Overview  The new Honor 10 Lite has a large  6.21″ LCD screen  up front with  Full HD+ resolution . Pixels wise, we might not be able to expect flagship level display, but it might be impressive, nevertheless. The screen is packed in a body that flaunts gradient colors in an eye-candy design.        In the camera department, the rear setup packs dual cameras – a  13 MP primary lens  with  f/1.8 aperture , and a  2 MP depth sensor . The  front camera is a 24 MP lens  with  f/2.0 aperture . But with its new AI capabilities, they claim that this camera will be a game changer. It supposedly features pixel-binning to emulate 1.8 micrometers of pixel size and learns from your selfie preferences over time. Also, it enables you to change the shape of a face, color, eye-colors, surrounding light, and even whiten your teeth! Talk about a misleading Tinder profile, right? But well, seems  AI in the camera  is going places.  Inside the shiny body, a  HiSilicon\xa0Kirin 710  powers the phone, which can deliver good mid-tier performance. There are also  4 GB / 6 GB RAM  variants, with  64 GB / 128 GB internal storage . There is also an option for expandable storage of up to 512 GB that uses the secondary SIM slot. This phone packs a  3400 mAh battery with Fast Charging  features and USB-C. And this phone, thankfully, features the  3.5mm headphone jack .  The phone will be running on the latest  EMUI 9.0.1  based on  Android 9.0 Pie , with features like Adaptive Battery, Adaptive Brightness and Android Dashboard out of the box.

['Solid State Batteries: Finally here?'],[],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['November 22, 2018']",2018-11-22 09:54:39+00:00,"['The batteries that are in wide-spread use today, Lithium-Ion is said to have reached its peak potential. i.e., it’s in a state, where now, no further development on it is possible to optimize it make it better. These Lithium-ion batteries were popular for their high energy density, and low self-discharge. But that is never enough. And so, companies were looking further to develop batteries that would have higher-energy density, higher resistance to heat, making them more durable. And so,  Solid State Batteries  were supposed to be the answer.  What are Solid State Batteries?  Solid State Batteries are those that use both solid electrodes and solid electrolytes, instead of the liquid electrolytes used in today’s Lithium-ion batteries. The problem with this is that liquid electrolytes batteries are more flammable, and so, packing large-sized batteries always raises concern. They can lead to accidents, as seen on the  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 , although we aren’t sure if that is exactly what caused them.  With Solid State Batteries, however, using solid electrolytes in the battery would be immensely safer. Also, they are more resistant to heat, so, they’re able to withstand higher temperatures. And that in turn can help charge batteries faster with more watts. In addition, these solid electrolytes have higher energy densities. A  single unit can have 30% more energy density , i.e 400 Wh/kg. This makes them retain energy for longer periods of time, preventing self-discharge. A kind of battery, that charges fast, holds more power and is safer. All the requirements of a good kind of battery.        Development  The only problem was to figure out what to use as a solid electrolyte. And also, that they’re expensive to mass produce. But now, finally, it seems a Chinese startup company has figured out a solution.  Qing Tao Energy Development Co , a startup company claims to have deployed a production line of such batteries in East China. And it is already capable of producing 100 MWh worth cells per year. Although, there are no reports on how the company managed to do so. Maybe a trade secret?  But they plan to increase production to 700 MWh by 2020. And that may very well be the answer to our problems caused by conventional present batteries. These batteries are primarily for usage in cars and such. But we can only hope they will be integrated into mobile phones too!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/batteries.jpg']

And the recent examples are  Samsung Galaxy A7 2018  and  Samsung Galaxy A9 2018 , which come with three and four cameras at the back and a total of four of five cameras respectively. But even with that many cameras, Samsung has not yet been satisfied. This time, Samsung is planning a smartphone, which will be boasting a total of six cameras.

['LAVA R3 Prime with Helio A22 chipset launched in Nepal'],['Lava'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['November 21, 2018']",2018-11-21 13:04:36+00:00,"['We don’t really see  LAVA phones  these days in the market. But they were once one of the popular brands in Nepal. But it seems after a long time, we are getting a new LAVA phone in Nepal – the Lava R3 Prime. The  LAVA R3 Prime  is an addition to the R-series lineup and is a budget phone that costs below Rs. 20000 here. And what does it have to offer in the almost saturated smartphone market of ours?  LAVA R3 Prime Overview  The LAVA R3 Prime seems to be focusing on the selfie camera aspect of things. This phone features a  13 MP selfie camera  up front with a front flash module as well. It also features a software-based bokeh mode for those enhanced portrait images we tend to go after. The company claims that the front camera is fine-tuned for capturing good details in selfies even at night time. Will it live to its promises or not, that remains to be seen.  Other than the selfie camera, the rear camera is also a  13 MP setup  with Phase Detection  AutoFocus.  The inclusion of a single camera only at the back may seem strange to us these days, but this is what the phone packs. It also has a  rear-mounted fingerprint scanner  just below the camera. All these are packed into a plastic body.        Under the hood, the LAVA R3 Prime is powered by a  2.0 GHz Quad-core MT6761 chipset . Also known as the Helio A22, this is a low-end chipset. It also packs about  3 GB of RAM , making it very similar to the  Xiaomi Redmi 6A . Besides that, there is a  32 GB of internal storage , and a  3300 mAh battery .  Also, it features a  5.7″ IPS LCD display with HD+ resolution  with a Full-view 18:9 aspect ratio. There are no notches on this device, so, for those who absolutely hate notches, this might be another option for them. The phone also has the  Facial recognition   feature,  which is software based. It runs on  StarOS 5.1  on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. For all of this, the phone is  priced at Rs.18,999 .   This is still a budget phone, but if you ask me, I think that is a bit too much. Especially, when you get the  Xiaomi Redmi 6  with a slightly more powerful chipset for a lesser price. And there’s also the  OPPO A3s  and  Lenovo K5 Play  as well. What other features it has to compel us to get the phone, that remains to be seen.   LAVA R3 Prime Specifications   Design : Plastic body, rear-mounted fingerprint sensor  Display : 5.7″ IPS LCD HD+ display with 18:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : 13 MP lens with PDAF  Front Camera : 13 MP with front flash  CPU : Quad-core 2.0 GHz MediaTek MT6761 (Helio A22)  GPU : IMG GE8300  RAM : 3 GB  Storage : 32 GB (internal)  Battery : 3300 mAh  OS : StarOS 5.1 on top of Oreo 8.1  Price in Nepal : Rs.18,999   Also Read:  Lava Mobiles Price in Nepal  What do you think of LAVA’s latest addition to the R-series?

['MPOW Flame Bluetooth Headphones Review – Simply a good pair'],"['Earphone', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['November 21, 2018']",2018-11-21 12:38:07+00:00,"['Headphones – a must-have accessory for everyone. But the problem is, choosing one is great pain-in-the-neck, because well, there are too many to choose from. A lot of things to consider – from price to the quality, and durability, and everything. But the  MPOW Flame Bluetooth Headphones  is there in Amazon’s top picks. And we thought why not check out why everyone is buying them?\xa0Now the one in this review is the MPOW MPBH088AB model from the MPOW Flame series, and these ones  cost some $22 . While this may put them in the budget headphones category, they do pretty well. Let’s find out more about the device in this MPOW Flame Bluetooth headphones review.  Also Read:  Things to consider while choosing headphones         Design and Build  First, these pair of headphones come in a pretty sweet packaging. They come in a case, which you can carry around to put these in, when not in use. Inside, there’s a micro USB cable to charge it, and you also get some extra ear-buds, in various sizes, for comfort. All this leads to a good first impression.  In terms of design and build, the headphones themselves look stylish, but it resembles the Beats headphones – the Wireless Powerbeats – which actually cost over $100. These, however, cost less than quarter that price, and look equally good. Since these go in your ears, it is an in-ear headphone.   As for the build, the wire is of a good length, just enough to go around your neck, and not look too long. All the buttons are on the right. The  power button also doubles as the Play/Pause button  and to pick up calls as well. The volume buttons are on top with which you can also switch to previous or next songs with a long press.  It also has  rubber-silicone ear hooks  that help keep these snuggly fit in your ears. The  memory foam earbuds  are quite comfortable. The earbud is soft and there’s no any kind of irritation or annoyance, allowing you to put them in your ears for quite a stretch of time too. These headphones are designed for working out, so there’s very less doubt about comfort.  Plus, these are  IPX7 water resistant , which means you can drop it u1-meter deep water and they’ll still work. This feature actually is best while working out, as it also makes them sweat-proof. But it is also usable when it’s raining lightly. When you do pour water over them, however, they might not work if there’s still water lodged in the ear buds. But a simple removal and cleaning out the water will make it up and running.  Overall, the wire and the rubber-plastic mold construction appears pretty durable. The ear hooks are flexible enough to bend without breaking, and the rest of it doesn’t feel cheap at all. Even though they cost only slightly over $20, there’s no budget headphone vibe from this.  Connectivity & Latency  The connectivity here is standard with  Bluetooth 4.1 . It works up to a range of close to 10 meters. And as it with such headphones, the distance matters less than the obstacles between the two devices.  What I mean is, in an open area, the Bluetooth signal works good until the acclaimed  10 meters , but when in between rooms, the signal tends to fluctuate even within range.  There is basically, no latency in terms of sound. Even while playing videos on YouTube or any such streaming sites, there is no noticeable lags between the video and sound. Even during calls, there is no noticeable sluggishness. The only noticeable lag appears while playing or pausing the media with the button on the headphone. And that takes like a second to respond to the commands.  Sound Quality  The sound quality is really impressive. Of course, these are not the best sounding headphones out there, but the audio output is really pleasing. This claims to feature  True High Definition sound  and  Deep Bass . And while the true HD sound seems true, I found the bass just okay.  Whatever you listen on these, they sound rich, crisp and have great audio clarity. The audio output seems very balanced – neither too much bass, nor too much treble. While listening to songs, you can easily make out the words and such. I mean, I began understanding lyrics of certain songs that I’d been singing wrong to this day!  But, if you are into heavy bass music or such, this might not be for you. The bass isn’t bad…it’s just doesn’t offer as much bass as some other headphones. This is because it concentrates on providing an overall balanced audio experience. These headphones are great for the regular users, but might not work for bass lovers.  It features  noise cancellation in the mic , which makes for good call quality. The earbuds also block external noise effectively. Of course, with heavy disturbance, that is not the case, but for your regular daily noise or such, it is highly effective.  Overall, the headphone focuses on sound clarity and balanced audio output rather than bass, and so, it makes for a great audio experience for regular users.  Battery  In terms of battery, these headphones claim some  7 – 9 hour battery life , and that is a pretty close estimate. I got close to 7 hours each time on a full charge while connected to my phone. However, it doesn’t last as long when connected to a laptop.  The  100 mAh battery  charges up fairly quickly, in just some  1 and half hours , give or take 5 minutes. And for something that’s wireless, that’s a pretty good amount. However, you need to be careful to only  use a 5V charger  as it is mentioned. Now, I don’t know what happens if you use any other chargers, but better be on the safe side.  Conclusion   All in all, these headphones do pretty well in all aspects – Comfort, Durability, Functionality and Sound Quality. These headphones cost $22, and we all know there are so many other headphones that cost a lot more and don’t perform well in all of these aspects. But these ones do, except for a few shortcomings.  These are easily available in Amazon, being one of the top picks in headphones. There aren’t many areas where one can criticize these pair of headphones. Maybe that’s why it’s so popular.

['OPPO A7 Review: A Mid-Range phone with Budget specs'],"['OPPO', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['November 21, 2018']",2018-11-21 12:20:56+00:00,"['From the makers of the  OPPO F9 , one of the best mid-range phones, comes the  OPPO A7 . The Oppo A7 is Oppo’s latest addition to the mid-range section, or is it? With a not so impressive spec-sheet and features, the phone seems to be far away from OPPO’s usual offerings. Recent OPPO phones like the OPPO F9 were a great hit, but with the OPPO A7, it’s kinda difficult to tell.  During my first hands-on with the phone, my initial impressions of it were that of a budget phone. And internationally, it seems like its priced just right, with the  4/64 GB variant priced at $230 . But in Nepal, it costs a  whopping Rs. 35,790  which converts to around $310. And that is just absurd! And that is just a bad first impression. But let’s see what does this phone have.         OPPO A7 Specifications:   Design : Glossy plastic construction  Display : 6.2″ IPS LCD HD+ resolution (720 x 1520 pixels)  Rear Camera : Dual Camera setup, 13 MP primary lens with f/2.2 aperture + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : 16 MP camera with f/2.0 aperture  CPU : Octa-core 1.8 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 450  GPU : Adreno 506  RAM : 4 GB  Storage : 64 GB internal storage + dedicated microSD card slot (up to 256 GB)  Battery : 4230 mAh  Software : Android 8.1 Oreo with ColorsOS 5.2 on top  Connectivity :\xa0Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Hotspot  Price in Nepal : Rs.35,790   Design   As for the phone, the phone has a plastic construction, with a glossy finish. The design looks almost like glass at first glance and has the same smooth feeling in your hands. It’s very easy to mistake it for glass but it’s lightweight will give it away. Even though the phone has a considerable thickness, there is no heft to it, which is why, even though it has a premium appearance, it doesn’t feel that way in your hands. So, this phone doesn’t feel very premium.   Personally, I think there’s nothing striking about the phone. The back has a  2.5D curved design , and it is, admittedly, a somewhat different approach for OPPO. The volume rockers are on the left, while the power button resides on the right. It still has  a micro USB port , at the end of 2018, which is a disappointment. The fingerprint sensor is positioned nicely beneath the dual camera setup at the rear, and it is easy to reach too.   Display  Up front, there is water-drop display with the tiny notch, very similar to the OPPO F9. It is a is a  6.2” IPS LCD panel  with an  HD+ resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels . Yes, this is only HD+, not the full HD we normally see on a phone at this price bracket. With a  19:9 aspect ratio , the display size is good, but a  271 PPI pixel density  is not enough.   If you observe closely, you can see some pixelation on the screen. However, color representation, accuracy, and overall display seem good enough. Still, the lack of a Full HD display in a phone of this price category bothers me.  Camera  As for the cameras, the rear camera is a dual camera setup which combines  a 13 MP primary sensor  with  f/2.2 aperture  and a  2 MP depth sensor . Camera quality is just about average, as it depends heavily on the light. And with a narrow aperture, it is easy to see why. In good lighting condition, the details in the pictures are good enough, but in low light, the images come out grainy and gather a lot of noise.   Portrait mode, as usual, is a hit or miss. Some samples, like that of close-up portraits look good and that happens when you have just the right lighting conditions. Edge detection is also good for those conditions. However, for full-body shots, the bokeh effect doesn’t look as good. Edge detection suffers, and the camera cannot recognize differences between the subject and the background very well.      Oppo A7 Camera samples   1  of 14               Color accuracy         Food         Daylight 1         Daylight 2         Low light         Low light 2         Portrait         Portrait 2         Portrait 3         Outdoor selfie         Indoor Selfie         Group selfie         Portrait selfie         Portrait selfie 2                                                      In low light, portrait mode is a straight up miss. The edge detection takes worse hits and suffers and the images gather noise. I would like to blame the small 2 MP depth sensor for that, but the OPPO F9 has the same sized depth sensor and that takes great pictures. So, I don’t know what is with the cameras of the A7. Now, this is not straight up criticism, it’s just that the image quality is not at par with other smartphones of the similar price range.   The front camera is a  16 MP shooter with f/2.0  and seems to perform better than the rear camera. The details in selfies are just better than pictures taken with the rear ones. It gathers better light, and image quality comes out good. The software-based portrait also gives a better sense of depth.      Oppo A7 Beauty Modes   1  of 4               Normal selfie         AI Beauty Mode         Beauty Mode level 3         Beauty Mode level 6                        There’s the presence of OPPO’s Beauty Mode, which enhances your facial features for beautiful selfies. The AI Face Beauty has a lot to improve while using it on manual mode can give you good results only up to level 2. The rest makes your face appear very cartoonish and weird.  For high-res camera samples of these photos,   click here>>  Overall, the cameras are nothing very special, but aggressively average.  Battery and Memory  In terms of battery, OPPO is always generous. There’s a large  4230 mAh  unit packed inside, and that’s not new for Oppo. They’re used to pushing huge batteries on their phones, and with just an HD+ screen, the battery does last a good amount of time. However, there is no any kind of fast charging standard. So, the large battery takes quite a while to charge. It takes  over 2 and a half hours  for the battery to go from 0 to 100%.  Memory wise, the phone comes in two variants. A  3 GB RAM with 32 GB storage  and another one with a  4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage . However, in Nepal, we only have the 4/64 GB variant. There is an option to expand the storage up to 256 GB with  a mircoSD card , and you get a dedicated slot.  Battery and Memory wise, the phone tends to be generous and that’s a good thing.  Performance  The performance aspect is the one that suffers the most. It is quite ridiculous that for such a price, you only get a  Snapdragon 450  chip inside! Yes, a Snapdragon 450! The same processor that you find on the Oppo A3s, which costs almost half of what this costs!  The 4 GB RAM inside tries very hard it seems, but the low-end chipset just doesn’t cut it. And even if there were any excuses for other features of the phone, such a chipset for a phone of this price range is stupid.  The Snapdragon 450 performs just as expected. Multi-tasking is okay up to an extent, but it cannot keep apps open in the background for long. The sluggishness is also noticeable while switching between apps. Initial app loading time is also slow. And if you have multiple tabs open on the web browser, the overall speed of the phone becomes quite slow.  Gaming on this phone is also strictly average. While light games can run pretty well, heavy games like PUBG suffers. You can play PUBG in Balanced graphics and Medium frame rates, but you will face some stutters and navigating is not as smooth. The Game Space feature on this phone, which is somewhat similar to Huawei’s Turbo Boost helps. But it can’t give you the full smooth experience. Asphalt 9 is playable on low settings and even then, it takes a while to load, and there are some minor stutters sometimes.  Software wise, the  Colors OS 5.2 on top of Android 8.1  has been updated which is now a bit more user friendly. Overall experience is the same as the ColorsOS seems very heavy. But one thing is that you no longer have to swipe left and cross out notifications to get rid of them, which is a relief. Other than that, there are some bloatware you can’t get rid of, but they are not as many as on some other phones.  Conclusion  Now it might appear as if this review is focusing only on the negative aspects of the phone. But for a phone with similar specs to that of a budget phone that costs close to Rs.36000, this is to be expected. First, a phone with Snapdragon 450 should not cost that much.   Now there is the  Samsung Galaxy A6+  with the same chipset, and costs more than this, but that phone has a good design, a Full HD AMOLED display and great cameras to show for it. The OPPO A7, however, cannot be compared to that at all.   This phone is basically the  Oppo A3s  with extra steps, that extra step being the 16 MP front camera over Realme 2’s 8 MP. And even that extra step is not worth this exorbitant price. I would probably pay up to Rs.25000 for this phone, not a bit more, And to think this phone is priced almost Rs.36000!   There you have it. The Oppo A7! With a large difference in price here, that is Rs.35,790. You get a lot of phones in this price range. There’s also the  Huawei Y9 2019  and  Xiaomi Mi A2 , both of which cost less than this. And we cannot forget the  Pocophone F1 !    So, with all that competition out there, this phone simply appears to be a waste of money. If the price had been somewhere along the lines of less than 25000, maybe this review would have turned out differently. But it’s not, so for now, I’d like to advise you to let this phone go.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/oppo-a7-review.jpg']

['Vivo V11 Review: Yet Another Good Mid-ranger'],"['Reviews', 'Vivo']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['November 16, 2018']",2018-11-16 03:50:28+00:00,"['The  Vivo V11 or the V11i , whatever you call it, is Vivo’s new not-so-new smartphone of the V-series. The device has gathered a lot of attention right now, and I feel like it’s the right time to do its full review, after all, I have used it for 3 months already. I kind of like the device for its price, but there are a few shortcomings. So, let’s get started.   Vivo V11 Specifications:   Display: \xa06.3 inches, IPS LCD  Resolution:\xa0 1080 x 2280 pixels, 19:9 ratio (400\xa0PPI density)  Dimensions:  155.9 x 75.6 x 8.1 mm (6.14 x 2.98 x 0.32 in)  Weight:\xa0 163g  Chipset: \xa0MediaTek MT6771 Helio P60 Octa-core (4×2.0 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×2.0 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU: \xa0Mali-G72 MP3  OS:\xa0 Android 8.1 Oreo with Funtouch OS 4.5  RAM:  4GB  Internal Memory:  128GB; expandable up to 256GB  Primary Camera:\xa0 Dual 16 MP + 5 MP, 1080p@30fps  Secondary Camera:\xa0 \xa025 MP, f/2.0, 1080p@30fps  Sensors: \xa0Fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery: \xa0Non-removable Li-Ion 3400 mAh battery, Fast Charging  Available Colors: \xa0Starry Night, Dazzling Gold, Nebula  Price:\xa0 Rs 39,990   Design         2018 has been the year of glass back phones. Even the mid-range devices are providing glass back smartphones. And the ones that have stuck with metal, come with quite a premium feel to it. However, the Vivo V11 has taken a different route here. It features a glass-like plastic back. And this is where I have an issue. The back is cheap and over time it has developed a lot of scratches. Yes, plastic backs are more secure than glass, but I think a phone like the V11 should have at least a metallic back. This back is probably the reason why it is light, and I kind of don’t like that. But this is totally my personal preference. The same goes with the buttons that are all on the right side. They feel cheap, and I just don’t like the feel of it.  Another thing that I don’t like here is the lack of LED notification light. Yeah-yeah, I get that there’s little space up front for the LED light, and there is the wakeup screen remainder feature, but I don’t like to see my phone wake up every time I get a notification. You do get to see the notification by waving your hand above the sensors, but this is an IPS panel here, and I don’t like to lose battery life for even the slightest bit.   Even though the build quality of this device is not that good, I have liked its design and the thinness, and there might be someone who might even like its lightweight. Also, the Vivo V11 comes in a variety of unique colors, but I have liked this Nebula color variant which is featuring in a lot of Chinese smartphones these now. And despite the thinness, there is still the beloved headphone jack on the bottom here.  Display   The Vivo V11 features the Halo Full View display up front and it is everything you can ask for. This 6.3-inch IPS panel is vibrant, it is colorful, it is bright, it does justice while watching videos, and it has ample sharpness as well. The bezels are quite minimalistic and even the notch has shrunk down to give users more screen space. I have to give the Essential phone credits for doing this before anyone else. This notch here doesn’t come in between the user experience.  Vivo has added an option to let the users themselves decide on whether they want their content to fill up the whole display or not according to individual applications, which is cool!  Performance  On to the performance side, the  MediaTek Helio P60 processor  along with 4 GB of RAM is a good combination for the price on the Vivo V11. It has been able to do everything I have wanted it to do without any issue whatsoever like multitasking, apps opening time, and using heavy apps – all run flawlessly.  Even the benchmark scores show how close the  Snapdragon 660  and the MediaTek P60 is as you can see them for yourself.   Vivo V11 Benchmark Score  Infogram  However ,  when you game on the V11, it falls just a tad bit behind the competition like the  Xiaomi Mi A2 . I did play a lot of games on this phone, and you get a few stutters around 4-5 times on, say, 20 minutes of game time. I felt this mostly while playing PUBG on medium settings.   Vivo V11 Geekbench Score  Infogram  \xa0  Now you have to note that this issue will be faced by someone who plays a lot of high-end games on their mobile phone, but if you are someone who does a light gaming at the end of the day, you might not be bothered with this issue.  Software   Now I don’t think you can review a Vivo phone without talking about the software. I have to give credit to Vivo for providing me with software updates as in my 3 months of use I have already received 2 updates.  But that doesn’t cover how much I dislike iOS running on top of Android. Oh, did I say iOS? Well, I am not wrong then, see it for yourself. Funtouch OS is a blatant copy of iOS. It also has a ton of bloatware that you cannot delete. It’s about time, Vivo, it’s about time you change the User Interface on your devices.  Now I criticized the software, but there are some features that I have liked. You get gesture control and other gesture shortcuts that have made the user experience easier. The three-finger swipe for capturing screenshots has been useful for me as well.  Security   Like almost all smartphones of the present time, the Vivo V11 offers two major security options for the users. Now the bigger brother of this phone, the V11 Pro, features an in-display fingerprint scanner, but I still fill that the technology has a long way to go, and I am happy that Vivo has included the traditional fingerprint scanner here.  It is fast, blazing fast, and it gets it right all the time. The front camera seconds as the face unlock option which, like the fingerprint sensor, works 100% of the time and fast. It also works during night time, so I definitely give full marks to Vivo here.  Camera   The overall camera performance of the Vivo V11 is good as it is one of the best camera smartphones of the mid-range price segment as of now.   The pictures from the device have a slight pinkish tint to it, but the saturation and details are top-notch. It has a good dynamic range as it preserves the highlight details and shadow details of the images quite nicely. However, the V11 doesn’t do that well if the contrast and exposure are concerned.   Portrait images are good as well. But, even with the secondary camera featuring a higher megapixel count of 5MP, the Oppo F9 with its 2MP depth sensor does a better job than the V11 here. However, the Vivo V11 portrait shots are not that bad either.   During night time, the images from the V11 come out slightly warmer to my taste. However, on the details and saturation front, it did better than the Nova 3i. The Oppo F9 outperformed the V11 in this aspect though.  Talking about the videos, well, this is a mid-range smartphone and for what its worth, it did an “okay” job. With the lack of stabilization, the videos come out a little shaky although it does a respectable job in terms of the color reproduction.  Now, Vivo has been boasting about its selfie standards on almost every phone they launch. And they have been great. There have been times where even the front-facing camera has done a better job than the rear one. And this time with the V11, Vivo has a lot to offer with the 25-megapixel selfie shooter.   The camera smoothens the face even without the beauty mode enabled, but overall, I really like how bright and colorful the selfies have come out. Just look at these selfies. If you really want to beautify your face, Vivo has even included AI-enabled beauty mode than applies the necessary setting according to your skin.   Also, Check out this comparison shot between the V11 and the other two phones I talked about before. Now I will let you, the viewers are the judge of the selfies, but I think the Oppo and Huawei phones capture in more details than the V11.   During night time, the selfies are great too, and that’s definitely good to see. The V11 has ample lighting and details even on the pictures from night time. The 3i isn’t that good, and even the F9 falls behind in this aspect.  For more high-resolution image samples from the Vivo V11,  click here .   Call Quality, Speaker, and Storage  In terms of call quality, well I have had no issues with this device. Yes, the call volume could have been slightly better, but you have nothing to worry about.  Now, this might sound as nitpicking as even the flagship phones aren’t dealing well with this issue, but the speakers on this phone is a little low for my taste. I know I can’t expect much for this price, but I think Vivo could have made the speakers a little louder as, at times, this device could even fill up a room.   The Vivo V11 has also set a standard even for the flagship phones, and that’s in the storage front. This mid-range device is available in 128 GB variant for its mid-range price, and that’s just great considering how its competitors 64 GB variant are being sold for a similar price tag.  Now the storage chip may not be as fast as the ones on the flagship phones, but it’s good to see mid-range smartphones offer higher storage variants for the user to use. There is also a support for expandable storage, so you can forget about running out of memory with the V11.  Battery   On the battery front, with the 3,400 mAh capacity on the V11, you get around 4hrs 30min to 5 hours of screen on time which normally translates to me charging the phone before the day ends. But what I like about it is the fast charging technology that’s here.  It’s not as fast as the Oppo F9’s VOOC charge or even the V11 Pro’s Dual Engine technology for that matter, but this battery charges up in around 1 hour and 50 minutes, that’s considering how the speed decreases after 80% of charge. It’s definitely good to see OEMs include quick charge on their mid-range phones this year.  CONCLUSION  So, in the end, what do I make of the Vivo V11? Well, there are the issues I have with this device which I discussed earlier. It has that software, obviously, the poor build quality, and the only average Gaming performance.  But if you take a good look at all the negatives I have pointed out, except for the build, you can overlook the issues this phone has. I mean it has a good camera, a good display, a well-performing CPU, one of the fast fingerprint scanner, and fast charge technology. During my time with the phone, I have thoroughly enjoyed using it. So, if you are out in the market for a mid-range smartphone, I think you should take a look at the Vivo V11 too.      Pros  Cons    – Good overall Performance  – Average gaming performance    – Fast Charging  – No LED Notification Light    – Top-quality selfies  – Plastic Build']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vivo-V11-Review.jpg']
['Lenovo K9 to launch in Nepal soon'],['Lenovo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['November 15, 2018']",2018-11-15 11:28:28+00:00,"['With two Lenovo phones launched very recently, the  Lenovo S5 and the Lenovo K5 Play , another Lenovo phone is coming to Nepal. The newcomer is the Lenovo K9, another budget phone that might cost very well under Rs.20000. Now, I know that Lenovo brand is not as popular as it was. But under new management, Lenovo phones might be able to get back to where it was before.  Lenovo K9 Specifications:   Design : Glowing glass-like plastic construction  Display : 5.7″ IPS LCD panel with HD+ resolution (720 x 1440)  Rear Camera : Dual camera setup, 13 MP primary lens with f/2.2 aperture & PDAF + 5 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : Dual camera setup, 13 MP primary lens\xa0with f/2.2 aperture & PDAF + 5 MP depth sensor  CPU : 12 nm octa-core MediaTek Helio P22  GPU : PowerVR GE8320  RAM : 3 GB  Battery : 3000 mAh  Internal storage : 32 GB  Price in Nepal : Under Rs.20000 (expected)    Lenovo K9 Overview  The Lenovo K9 comes in a glossy looking plastic construction, similar to the K5 Play. With that type of body, you can expect a shiny premium look, but the phone should be kinda light. You get a fingerprint sensor at the back, a dual-SIM slot, one of which, is a hybrid SIM slot. The headphone jack is still there, and one of the best features is that it has a  USB-C port . That’s something new on a budget smartphone.        The display is a  5.7″ IPS LCD with HD+ resolution  and 18:9 aspect ratio. Even for a recent launch, it still doesn’t have a notch, but bezels at the top and bottom. For those who don’t like bezels, but want a newer phone, then, this could be an option.  Also, for a  phone that comes under Rs. 20000 , you get four cameras – two on the front, and two at the back. I won’t expect the camera quality to be outstanding for a phone at this price, but I can’t say for sure. Maybe this phone will surprise us. The rear dual camera setup is a combination of a  13 MP primary lens  with f/2.2 aperture and a  5 MP depth sensor.  The dual camera setup at the front is also of the same configuration and both sides are capable of capturing 1080p videos @60 fps.  Inside, a  12 nm octa-core MediaTek Helio P22 powers  the phone. It is supported by a  3 GB RAM , which is of a similar specs to the Xiaomi Redmi 6. Lenovo phones feature a close to stock Android experience, but there’s still something about them that makes them appear little less like stock Android.\xa0Other than that, you get a  3000 mAh battery , which, for a budget phone is good enough.  So, that’s the Lenovo K9. To me, it appears a good competitor with the budget phones in the Nepali market. How it will fare, we will know when it lands here soon. It is very similar to the Redmi 6 – the major difference being USB-C and quad cameras. So, the price is also likely to be a slightly higher than the Redmi 6.  What do you guys think of this phone? Can it be compared to the Xiaomi Redmi 6? And can it be a good product? Do let us know.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/lenovo-k9-featured.jpg']

The device came with a decent design and battery performance and was primarily targetted at the South Asian users. The device now is experiencing some massive price drops. But does the price drop compensate for the old age of Oppo A7 in the competitive mid-range segment of Nepal? Let’s learn more about it.   Oppo A7 Overview  The Oppo A7 is an attractive looking smartphone with a waterdrop notch. This makes the A7 look similar to the  Oppo F9  on the front side, with an almost similar 6.2-inch display with minimalistic bezels all around. What’s different here is the resolution of this display as the new device comes only with an HD+ configuration which is quite a disappointment if you consider its price tag.         Another area where the Oppo A7 isn’t attractive is underneath the hood, at it is powered by the Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450. This CPU is coupled with 4 GB of RAM, Adreno 506 GPU along with 64 GB of internal memory. The onboard storage is expandable up to 256 GB via a microSD card.   Talking about the camera setup, there are dual 13- and 2-megapixel cameras on the back with f/2.2 and f/2.4 aperture respectively. On the front lies a 16-megapixel selfie shooter. There is a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner on the device, and it will probably be equipped with the face unlock feature.  The battery is the major talking point of the Oppo A7. It houses a large 4,230 mAh battery that should last for a longer time period with the HD+ display. However, the Oppo A7 lacks fast charging technology which will most probably be a hassle to all users.

What is even sadder is people playing mobile PUBG on their PCs. But there are still a lot of dedicated gamers out there who swear by the PC Master race or even console players for that matter. So, this list is for all the PC gamers, a guide to choosing the right gaming monitor for your setup.  Also Read:\xa0 Top 5 Applications you need to install on your new Gaming PC  It’s 2018 and we’ve got 8k monitors up for grabs. But not everyone can afford one nor are their GPUs capable of handling them. So, choose a monitor, or rather the resolution of the monitor according to your GPU. If you own a GPU that’s below a GTX1060, get a 1080p monitor. For 1070 and above, you can still opt for a 1080p display but try for a higher refresh rate.        As for 4k gaming, at least make sure it has a GTX1080Ti.\xa0If you bought the RTX series from Nvidia, then the RTX2070 performs more or less like the GTX1080. The RTX2080 is similar to the GTX 1080Ti, and finally, the RTX2080Ti is in a league of its own. All these comparisons only work if you do not factor in their real-time ray tracing features.  Also Read:  Nvidia RTX series launched  As for AMD users, the RX Vega 64 is the closest when it comes to performance with the 1080Ti. More so, it’s comparable to the GTX1080, if a bit slower. The RX Vega 56 is a close match to the GTX1070. The bottom of the line GTX1060 matches its performance with the RX 580/870, but all NVidia counterparts are just better in my opinion.  Once you decide on the resolution and the refresh rates, you can then go on to their color reproduction. Anything from 70% sRBG color coverage or above should do just fine. The more important number here is the response rate. If the monitor says gaming, it probably has a low latency, so anything below 10ms should be fine as well (lower the better).  Also Read:  Intel announces 9th Gen processors for gamers \xa0  Either way, the more you pay, the better you get any way you look at it. You can also look out for G-Sync (Nvidia users) or FreeSync (AMD), which will help a lot with tearing.

As the name sounds futuristic with 2019 in its name, I had to test it out whether it really does perform like a device from next year. So, here is the full review of the Y9 2019!  Huawei Y9 2019 Specifications:   Operating System: \xa0Android Oreo 8.1 with EMUI 8.2 on top  Display:\xa0 6.5-inches IPS LCD FHD+ screen with 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Resolution:\xa0 1080 x 2340 pixels  CPU: \xa0Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  Chipset: \xa0Hisilicon Kirin 710  GPU: \xa0Mali-G51 MP4  RAM:  4 or 6 GB  Storage:  128 or 64\xa0expandable up to 256 GB  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual\xa016 MP f/2.0 + 2 MP f/2.4 depth sensor  Front Camera: \xa013 MP f/1.8 + 2 MP f/2.4 depth sensor  SIM (s): \xa0Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by)  Battery:\xa0 Non-removable Li-Ion 4,000 mAh battery  Connectivity:  Wi-Fi\xa0 a/b/g/n/ac,\xa0dual-band, WiFi Direct, hotspot, Bluetooth 5.0  Sensors: \xa0Fingerprint (rear-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, Compass.    Display  So, the Huawei Y9 2019 is a successor to the Y9 2018 launched some 6 months ago and a lot has changed during this time. The display that was 5.9 inches has grown to 6.5 inches and you have the infamous notch upfront, which is a tad bit bigger than what we are used to like on  OPPO F9 (Read Review)  and  Vivo V11 Pro (Read Review) . What has also changed is the processor but let’s finish off with what’s on hands first.         So, coming back, the display here is an IPS LCD panel with FHD+ screen resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The display is humongous and is a perfect fit for multimedia consumption. Watching videos on the vibrant large screen is a treat to the eyes. Also, the minimum bezels add more points to the good viewing experience. Only if the notch was a bit smaller, it would have been so much better.  The phone gives you good sunlight legibility, so no problems will be felt outdoors.  But sadly, the display lacks any sort of protection, which is a bummer. Well if you look at the trend, very few Huawei phones come with display protection. I think this is an issue Huawei seriously needs to address.  Design  Design wise, the Y9 2019 is an impressive lad. This one has a curvy body which is a fresher look than what we have been seeing on other Huawei phones. It is not very heavy but still has that heft to it that makes it feel pretty premium.   This one is a slippery phone but we case our phones anyways. Also, my careless usage routine has resulted in some scratches overtime but surprisingly they are not that noticeable at the back but up front, they are clearly visible.  And this is not a glass back for sure but it has not made me feel sad about the phone as the Y9 2019 looks and feels good on hands. Also, talking about the aesthetics, you get all the buttons on the right, the dedicated SIM and memory card slot on the left; the single speaker grill, micro USB port, noise cancellation mic and a headphone jack at the bottom, with only the primary noise cancellation mic at the top.        1  of 3                                                \xa0  At the back, there is a fingerprint scanner, the dual camera setup, an LED flash, and the Huawei branding. The notch houses dual selfie cameras. Also, the Y9 2019 very cleverly hides the speaker grill right above the notch and in the rightmost corner, there is also a LED notification light.  Now, this I think is really cool! I mean with all the notches taking over, I have missed the LED light, but, well I miss it no more. Overall, the minimalist design has fairly impressed me.  Also read:  Huawei Mobiles price in Nepal  Performance, Software, and UI  Alright, enough about the outsides, let’s get into what’s inside this one. Huawei’s latest addition of mid-range chipsets, the Kirin Hisilicon 710 is what powers the device. Needless to say, we have seen this processor on the Huawei Nova 3i, and as I said in the review, this 12 nm energy efficient chipset is a good performer. It can handle almost everything you throw at it.  And as PUBG has become one of the prominent standards for testing games, well I had some sessions of it and the phone experiences some jitters while playing at medium settings. Also, you will experience some frame drops now and then. Otherwise, the phone has taken on my everyday usage pretty well. Moving on, other games run quite well and multitasking, as well as app opening, is pretty fast too.  But something that has bugged me is the phone loses it while multitasking with messenger running in the background. But I really hope a later software update will fix this.  On the software side, the Y9 2019 features Android Oreo 8.1 coupled with EMUI version 8.2. Huawei is pretty good with updates these days, and as this phone is from the future, I have high hopes for software updates.      Huawei Y9 2019 software UI    1  of 6                                                                              Anyways, as it is with all the Huawei phones, you do get some useless apps onboard and sad is the fact that not all of them can be deleted. Furthermore, it’s the same EMUI have we have been seeing on all the Huawei phones. There are tons of customizations you can do as per your liking, for instance, keeping or ditching the navigation buttons, changing your viewing preferences and so forth. You can customize the shortcuts on the taskbar as well. There is a simple mode too, that basically makes the app icons larger, which again may be useful for some people.  Battery:  The huge 6.5 inches display makes the Y9 2019 hungry for power which is well, provided very generously by the 4,000 mAh battery and I must say the battery life is very good indeed.  It gives you more than a day of backup, I mean on a single charge, you can last for one day and a half. Well, this is on normal usage, but even on intensive use, you can expect it to last for a good amount of time.  The phone will take you 2 hours and 30 minutes to give you a 100% juice. Well, with this its evident that there is no fast charging support here. But unlike some Samsung phones, it does not take ages to charge.  Here’s the most annoying part: This is the Huawei Y9 2019, a phone from the future, a phone from 2019 and it still has a micro USB. It’s true. Okay, the lack of Fast Charging is somewhat justifiable here but a micro USB port is a serious bummer here.  Anyways, to be fair the battery life is very enduring which may be an area to cover up for the absence of fast charging.  Camera:  Huawei’s usual quad camera setup makes its way here as well. The Y9 2019 has four cameras in total, two at the back and two at the front. If this sounds familiar, it is the same as that of the  Nova 3i (Read review) . But the setup comes with a slight difference between the two.   At the back, the Y9 2019 has a 16 MP f/2.0 primary camera with 2 MP sensing depth-sensing camera. The Nova 3i had a 16 MP f/2.2 camera. Likewise, the front of the Y9 houses a 13 MP f/1.8 aperture camera along with a 2 MP depth sensor. This is also slightly different than the Nova 3i having 13 MP f/2.2+ 2 MP cameras.  What this means is that the Y9 2019 captures more light than the Nova 3i due to its wide f/1.8 aperture and the pictures at low light conditions will also appear brighter than the Nova 3i.  Now talking about the quality of pictures, you can see they are sharp, no doubt on that. But the colors are a bit too punchy for my liking. This means the phone automatically over saturates the pictures. Other than that, pictures come out very colorful. However, the autofocus is a tad bit slower on this new Huawei device.

And I must say that the bokeh images are great. I mean, have a look at these samples, even though the edge detection is not that proper, the images look good overall.

But sometimes, the images tend to lose some details but most of the times, they seem very nice.  At low light conditions, the images are bright. But then again, the images are not free of noise and grains. Similarly, the autofocus becomes slower during this time.

Also, other times it does not make a lot of unnecessary enhancements. But then again, the images are already saturated, so there is actually no need for an Ai mode. Here are few samples for you to judge by yourself.

There is a beauty option though, but only in the portrait option, which is strange. Anyways the normal selfies are good enough, they do not look fake.

In very well lit conditions, sometimes the background seems exposed but other than that it fares well.

Selfies in low light conditions appear a bit grainy.

You can record videos in FHD at 60 fps but the quality is just average to my liking. Also, autofocus in videos is just subpar.  For all the high-quality samples  click here\xa0  Extras:  Talking about other features, the fingerprint sensor is pretty swift and so is the Facial recognition on this one.  Now, it’s the selfie camera recognizing your face, so you cannot expect it to be that secure. For me, the fingerprint sensor was my go-to unlock mechanism. Other than that, the speaker at the bottom gets distorted at high volumes and they are moderately loud.  Similarly, WiFi reception is pretty good too, and the good news is that there is dual-band WiFi ac, which was a feature lacking in the Nova 3i. Well, it seems some feedbacks are well taken by the Chinese company.  Likewise, call quality is good along with network reception. With these, I faced no problems what so ever. But something I would like to say is, the vibration of the phone is not that good. I have missed a few calls because of the reason!  Conclusion:  To conclude, the Huawei Y9 2019 is a very good upgrade from the Y9 2018. A larger display, better design, better performing cameras and Kirin 710 is pretty dope. Similarly, this device can be a perfect fit for multimedia consumers.  The phone is priced at Rs. 34,900 which is good enough for those specs but I think Huawei should have priced it a bit aggressively. Because the competition is getting really fierce if we take into account the pricing set by Xiaomi Nepal. There is the  Xiaomi Pocophone F1 (Read Review)  for a similar price and even if you go 4 thousand less, there is the  Mi A2 (Read Review)  waiting.  So, with so many competitors against the device, the Huawei Y9 2019 seems like a hard bargain! But you also get an overall package of a good smartphone here, so you can make your pick.      Pros    Cons     Sleek looks  Slightly bulky design    Very enduring battery life  Average speakers    Good front and back cameras  Subpar vibration    Large crisp display  Slightly Pricy']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/huawei-y9-2019-review.jpg']

It was the first Android-Go powered smartphone in Samsung’s lineup. And it was basically brought to lure people into cheaper smartphones instead of the feature phones. This time to offer more choices in the budget smartphones’ lineup, Samsung launched yet another Android-Go smartphone. The recently launched Android Go handset goes by the name Samsung Galaxy J4 Core. And it possesses somewhat richer specs when compared with the J2 Core.  Samsung Galaxy J4 Core Specs Overview  Budget handsets rarely come with a bigger display. But that’s not the case in the J4 Core. The smartphone comes with the tall 6.0-inch display. On the resolution front, the handset fancies HD+ resolution in an 18.5:9 aspect ratio. But IPS panel has been used on the display. So the users won’t be getting the deeper blacks and brighter whiter, which are usually found on most of the Samsung phones.  And a Quad-core CPU drives the processes inside the phone, which clocks at 1.4GHz. On the software front, J4 Core boasts the Android Oreo (Android Go Edition). And talking about the storage, there is 1GB RAM and 16GB of storage. Since the apps and processing are optimized in the Android Go version, even with the 1GB RAM, we can expect the phone to load and run light apps and games without any sort of issues.        On the optics front, the phone is equipped with an 8MP on the back and a 5MP shooter on the front. This is exactly the same setup seen on the J2 Core. But what has been the major upgrade from the J2 Core to the J4 Core is the battery. The newbie flaunts a humongous 3300mAh battery over the 2600mAh on the J2 Core.  The pricing of the smartphone is still under the veil and availability is still a secret. But since the smartphone is already on Samsung’s official website, it may not take long before we get more information regarding the smartphone.

And adding a surplus camera at the already crowded back, Samsung had launched a smartphone recently in the international market.  Samsung Galaxy A9 2018  is the phone, which rose in the smartphone market with four cameras at the back. It was the first smartphone to have quad camera setup at the back and it is still the sole smartphone to possess this quirky feature till date.  [Latest Price: Rs. 43,990] [Last updated on July 24, 2019]         Overview  The camera is the striking feature of the handset. And as mentioned earlier, the smartphone carries four cameras at its back. The primary rear camera on the A9 2018 embraces a 24MP sensor, which comes with an f/1.7 lens. There is also an 8MP camera module with an ultrawide angle lens, which increases the field of view. The additional 10MP camera module on the phone features a telephoto lens, which can be used to capture images with 2x lossless optical zooming. And lastly, there is a 5MP depth sensor, which comes into play while capturing the portrait images. Talking about the front camera, the phone boasts a 24MP sensor featured by an f/2.0 lens. Since Samsung has a good record of providing quality cameras on its phone, we can expect the cameras on the phone.   On the performance front, Samsung Galaxy A9 2018 comes with Snapdragon 660 chipset with 6GB of RAM alongside. In terms of memory, the A9 2018 flaunts 128GB of onboard storage, which can be substantial for most of the users. Additionally, there is a dedicated slot for a micro SD card to push the storage limit further.  Talking about the display, the phone comes with the tall 6.3-inch Super AMOLED display. The handset features Full-HD+ on the resolution front boasting a 392PPI of pixel density. So with this display setup on the phone, we can expect to view sharp, crisp and vibrant contents on the phone.   The phone also looks note-worthy in terms of horsepower. With 3800mAh battery, the battery backup looks dependable. There is also a fast-charging feature to squeeze power juice to the phone in a relatively shorter time. Talking about the colors, the phone comes in Caviar Black and Lemonade Blue options in Nepal.

"['Vivo V11 Pro – A lot of extras, Unpolished Basics']","['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Vivo']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['November 8, 2018']",2018-11-08 05:43:01+00:00,"['After the notched display trend to get larger displays on smartphones, companies, now, seem to be going after the traditional fingerprint sensor. Many phones are replacing it with the futuristic In-Display Fingerprint scanner. While the technology made debut commercially on the  Vivo X20 Plus UD , the Vivo V11 Pro is the one with it in South Asian markets. But what else does it have besides that? And is it worth it’s price tag of almost Rs.50000 in Nepal? Find out in this Vivo V11 Pro full review.   Vivo V11 Pro Specifications :   Design : Polycarbonate body with In-display fingerprint scanner  Display : 6.41″ Full HD+ Super AMOLED display (2340 x 1080) with 19.5:9 aspect ratio and 402 PPI  Rear Camera : Dual Camera setup, 12 MP primary lens with f/1.8 aperture + 5 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : 25 MP Camera with f/2.0 aperture  CPU : Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 660  GPU : Adreno 512  RAM : 6 GB  Storage : 128 GB (expandable via microSD)  Connectivity : 3.5 mm headphone jack, microUSB port, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Dual SIM (SIM + Hybrid SIM slot)  Battery : 3400 mAh with Dual Engine Fast Charging  Price in Nepal : Rs.49,490   Design  First, the design of the phone. The design is attractive, yes, but it kinda feels cheap on the hands. Of course, that has to do with its plastic back. The construction of the phone feels quite sturdy, and with its glossy finish, it can be easily mistaken for glass. But the phone’s light weight gives it away. The back is also a fingerprint magnet, attracting quite a bit of smudges. The phone is durable, no doubt, but it is very slippery.         The  polycarbonate back  held its own on some drops, but unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the front. The front is a  2.5D curved screen with Gorilla Glass 3 Protection , which cracked easily on a single drop. But luckily, for an AMOLED panel with an in-display fingerprint sensor, replacing the screen was relatively cheaper than I anticipated. (Cost me Rs.8800 (NRs.) to be precise)   Back to the design, the phone is quite big in size, but it is slim. Still…one handed usage is difficult. All the buttons are on the right, and the bottom houses a single speaker, a  3.5mm headphone jack  – which feels like a bliss in 2018, and a microUSB port. The fingerprint sensor is embedded in the display itself, and while that may make the phone appear futuristic, the microUSB feels silly, and that too, on a premium mid-ranger device! Of course, it is a cost cutting decision, but it doesn’t feel right in the final stages of 2018.   The color I had, i.e. Starry Night Black, is strikingly eye catching. It has a  dual-gradient color  that goes from blueish purple at the bottom to inky black at the top. There are also some sparkles at the bottom, which is probably why it’s called Starry night. The color at the bottom shifts from blue to purple, depending on the viewing angle. And while that reminds of  Huawei Nova 3  and  Nova 3i , the Vivo V11 Pro has its own additions that make for its stunning looks. If only, the back was metallic, it could have been my favorite design on a smartphone so far.   Also, the Vivo V11 Pro comes with a case in the box, and I recommend you use that on your phone. Because, even though the polycarbonate back is strong, it’s glossy finish is easy to scratch, and it is prone to slight discoloration with prolonged usage. So, if you want to avoid micro abrasions on it, do yourself a favor, and slap a case on it.  Overall, the phone looks striking, but fails to feel that way. It would have been great if the phone had a metal construction, because, for something that costs 49,500, a plastic back is another downer.  Display  Up front, the upgrade to  Super AMOLED panel  has made quite a difference! You get better color accuracy, with deeper blacks, punchy colors and better contrast overall. And even with an AMOLED screen, sunlight legibility is quite good. You’ll have no problem looking at the screen outdoors in different angles, whatsoever.   The screen is a large  6.41” with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio . There’s a small water-drop or a tear-drop notch (whichever you like to call it) on top that houses the selfie camera. The front speakers are also located right above the selfie camera, and that design is cleverly minimalistic. But one thing that you need to know is that you cannot hide the notch in the settings. It is there to stay. But even with the small notch, the arrangement of the notification and information stats is kinda haywire. It’s not very well organized to fit all your notification icons.  The bezels are ever so slim and that makes the screen appear larger than it already is. The tiny bezels on top also  accommodate the IR sensor  for the facial recognition. Even with this minimalistic design, the phone cleverly manages to include all that’s necessary. The  Full HD+ resolution of 2340 x 1080 , makes for a  402 PPI pixel density , and for a large screen such as this, it makes for quite the viewing experience.   The in-display fingerprint sensor occupies the bottom of the screen, and is visible only when you lift the phone in your hands. There’s the  Always On display option , which shows you the time, and battery level, but sadly, won’t show you notifications. And since the tiny notch means  no LED notification lights , this is another inconvenience you’ll have to get over. However, you can also customize the time to turn on and off the Always On display, which is a handy feature to save battery.  Camera   As for cameras, the Vivo V11 Pro packs a  dual camera setup of 12 MP with f/1.8 aperture  and a  5 MP depth sensor . The primary camera does a great job while capturing pictures. And I was thoroughly impressed by its ability to capture details. In good lighting, the sharpness of the images will impress you.      Sample Pictures   1  of 16               cloudy wide         cloudy wide         sunny greens         sketch detail         flower color         color accuracy         details         minor details         broad daylight         daylight hdr         color         food color contrast         food color cpntrast                oversaturated yellow                                                                   It represents colors accurately enough and your basic photography needs will easily be fulfilled. Low light images do get some noise, but the camera manages to brighten up the images.  What I mean is, even at very low light, the camera bumps the lighting to make it appear as if it was taken in better lighting conditions. If you look at these images, you’ll know, because even with the bumped up lighting, the grains in the images give it away.      Low Light bump up   1  of 3                                                Night shots, however, are not usable. They’re a mixture of noise, grains and everything unpleasant. However, with a source of light around, the pictures will maintain their composure.      Night Shots   1  of 5               evening hdr         evening          night         night light source         flash                            The depth sensor does a good job of background blurs and edge detection, but as it is with bokeh shots, these are always a hit and a miss. You can also choose to blur the foreground instead of the background, but of course you wouldn’t do that. In good lighting, the portrait shots come out great. However, in low light, the edge detection suffers, and aren’t satisfactory.      Portrait shots   1  of 6               bokeh focus         indoor bokeh                              group bokeh                              As with most phones of 2018, the  cameras are AI integrated , and while it comes into play at certain times, you won’t really notice the difference. The  AI Portrait Framing option  will help you focus on the necessary areas of your picture, but again, it’s not very accurate. You also get the  AI Face Beauty  feature in the back camera, but I don’t find it very useful. Of course, some of you out there would love this feature, as it can help remove all the blemishes and spots on your face, and make you look pretty.   As for the selfie camera, it is a  25 MP lens with f/2.0 aperture . And while the front camera can take good resolution pictures, I didn’t quite like it. Mainly due to its tendency to overstep beautifying aspects of your face. Now, there is a  separate beautifying options  in the selfie camera, but even with all that turned off, it sneaks up on you. So,  if you want to look natural in your selfies, you simply can’t!  But, for those who want to enhance themselves, you’ll like the selfie camera.      Selfie   1  of 5               group selfie         normal selfie                bokeh selfie         beauty mode selfie                           However, portrait shots with the selfie camera are still good, even though it’s all software. If you can get over the facial enhancements, you might like the overall results of your portrait selfies.  For high resolution image samples of the Vivo V11 Pro,  click here  For videos, the Vivo V11 Pro is  capable of taking 4K videos , but the  lack of Image Stabilization  makes this feature less useful. The camera lacks any kind of image stabilization – neither OIS nor EIS, so, you’ll need the steadiest hands you can find for your videography needs. However, the quality of the videos is good enough.  But Slow Motion on the Vivo V11 Pro seems half baked. For such a price, I expected it to have some sort of super slow-mo, but it actually doesn’t. The regular slow motion will not impress you any, and you might not even use it all that much, as it’s not that handy.  Overall, the camera offers a lot of bells and whistles, most of which, won’t come in handy for everyone. Instead of those half-baked extras, improvement over the basic camera features would have been better, like the inclusion of image stabilization. And Vivo needs to work on the facial enhancement features in their further phones.  Performance  There’s not much to say in the performance department. With an  octa-core Snapdragon 660 chipset  combined with  6 GB of RAM , the phone is quite powerful. The transitions between screens are fast, and multi-tasking is very smooth. It can keep apps open in the background for a considerable time too.   Gaming on it is also amazing, especially because of its large screen with the small notch. Regular games face no constraints, and even heavy games like PUBG runs very well on the highest possible settings. You can play it in HDR settings in High Frame rates, without any kind of lags or stutters.  I didn’t really notice much heating on the phone either. That maybe due to the plastic build, but even so, the thermal levels were lower than on other phones of similar construction. So, from a gaming perspective, this phone is a good choice.   The In-display fingerprint sensor, as exotic as it sounds, actually doesn’t perform that well. And by that, I mean, it’s a bit slow and sometimes, fails to recognize your fingerprints. Now given that it’s not your regular sensor, I can understand its slow speed. But the fact that it fails sometimes even when you press it nice and hard, it gets you thinking. However, the effect when you press the sensor are some cool extras.  The  Facial Recognition  is the one that impressed me, but also got me concerned about security. Now, it’s because, while the speed at which it can unlock your phone is superb, it can also do so at quite sharp angles. And if you think that’s fine, it unlocked the phone even when my face was half covered. The phone unlocks faster with the Facial recognition than the fingerprint sensor, but my only concern is…is it really all that secure?  Let me also mention that this phone doesn’t have the Widevine L1 certification. This means that you can stream contents from Netflix or Amazon Prime at 540p at the max. The Pocophone F1 received criticisms due to this, but there are many phone which still run on the Widevine L3 certification. So, I’m just putting it out there, because it’s not as big a deal for all of us, especially in South Asian market.  In terms of software, the Vivo V11 Pro runs on  Android 8.1 Oreo  with its  FunTouch OS 5.1  on top. And yes, we’ve always been saying that this uncannily resembles the iOS, but Vivo doesn’t seem to mind. I, on the other hand, don’t like this all that well.      iOS-like FunTouch OS   1  of 9               homescreen         no app drawer         vivo transition animation         notification shade         quick settings         multitasking         settings         dialer         quick access sidebar                                       There are plenty of bloat-ware in here, but you will get used to them in time. However, no search option in the settings menu, and having to slide up for the toggle settings menu feels a bit odd. The phone does come with Vivo’s own theme store, but they are also pretty heavy and won’t appeal to you that much.  Battery and Storage  As for storage, the phone is  available in 64 GB and 128 GB  variant, but the one we get in Nepal is the 128 GB variant only. If that’s not enough, there’s a  dedicated microSD  card slot, with which you can expand your memory up to 256 GB.  In terms of battery, the phone packs a  3400 mAh unit , which, may not be that big, but it can last you all day long. With regular to semi-heavy usage with constant use of social media apps and light gaming, you will still end up with more than 25% charge at the end of the day. If you’re a heavy gamer however, you might want to carry a charger around.  The charger is a microUSB, but it comes with  Vivo’s Dual Engine Fast Charging . Now, while the name sounds futuristic, its fast charging doesn’t seem to be faster than other fast charging standards on other phones. It is par with the Oppo’s VOOC charge and OnePlus’ Dash charge. So, nothing extra-ordinary, I guess.  Conclusion  The Vivo V11 Pro gives off a futuristic vibe with its large screen to body ratio, minimalistic design on the front, and its in-display fingerprint scanner. It has a few aspects in which it shines. For instance, the Super AMOLED display is great, it is pretty powerful, the rear camera picture quality is good, and the battery life is outstanding.   I have mixed feelings about its plastic build, the extra add-ons of the camera, in-display fingerprint sensor and the facial recognition. What I didn’t like is the selfie camera, the microUSB port, and the phone’s OS.  For something that costs close to 50000, even though the design looks good, I think a metal build is mandatory. The cameras’ extras need a bit of improvement, if it’s here to stay. The selfie camera’s beautifying feature also needs a bit of work as well. Also, a micro-USB port in 2018 is a downer. But, it has that dual-engine fast charging, so, I guess we can let it slide.  To conclude, the Vivo V11 Pro  costs Rs.49490  and for all that it packs, it seems to me a good deal. The areas it cuts corners in are quite clearly visible as well, but most of them are easy to get over. This phone excels in the basic features, but the extras they provide need some work. Hope Vivo addresses them for their future phones.

"['HP Spectre 13 x360 2018 Launched: More battery, more performance, and more portability']","['HP', 'Spectre Series']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['November 8, 2018']",2018-11-08 02:44:01+00:00,"['HP is undoubtedly a huge name in the portable PC market. The company’s Spectre-series brought something relatively new to the table, not that it was revolutionary but it was fresh nonetheless. Well, the new  HP Spectre 13 x360 2018  is now even fresher, cleaner, sharper and in fact\xa0better in any way possible.  The Spectre 13 x360 is now available in two colors,  Dark ash silver , and  Poseidon Blue , the latter $10 more expensive than the former. The HP Spectre 13 x360 comes in an all-new Aluminium chassis with a blue Sandblasted finish. It also features narrower bezels and a smaller footprint than it’s predecessor.  The HP Spectre 13 x360 comes in a much more angular and sharp design choice than before. A striking feature for me was the USB C port at the edge of the chassis [picture of it below]. If you put numbers to the context, the new laptop is now  14.5mm  thick and  1.3Kgs  heavy.        The HP Spectre 13 x360 comes with 8th Gen Intel processors. It’s based on the Whiskey Lake architecture, the third refresh in their 14++nm process. There is an increased Turbo clock speed, native USB 3.1 Gen 2 support, integrated 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0 and support for Intel’s own Optane memory. It’s also even more power efficient than before.  The particular processors used here in this laptop are the  i5-8265U  and the  i7-8565U . Both are Quad-Core processors with  Intel UHD 620 graphics  solutions. The i5-8265U has a base clock speed of 1.6GHz and can go all the way up to 3.9GHz. The i5 however only gets the opt for  8GB  of DDR4 2400MHz RAM.  Also Read:\xa0 Top 5 Applications you need to install on your new Gaming PC/Laptop \xa0  The i7-8565U, on the other hand, starts at 1.8GHz and goes all the way up to 4GHz. For this one, you can either opt in for 8GB or an optional  16GB  RAM with the same speeds. Jumping from i5 to an i7 is a $120 upgrade while for the 16GB of RAM, you will need to shell out another $80.  As for storage, the PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD solution on the\xa0HP Spectre 13 x360 starts from  256GB . For $100 more, you can opt for a  512GB variant . Add $200 more for a  1TB  version and finally $400 more for the  2TB  upgrade. So, it’s basically $100 for 256GB of fast PCIe NVMe storage.  You get three display options here. The first one is a base FHD IPS WLED display with edge-to-edge glass multi-touch display. Add $40 to that and you get the same display with an Integrated Privacy screen [watch the video below]. Then there is the $160 upgrade form for a 4k IPS display.  All displays cover  100% of the sRGB  color gamut with  400 nits  of brightness and are touch sensitive. While the 4k panel will suck up more power, the FHD display comes with an ultra-efficient\xa0panel with just  1W  of power consumption. This is one of the main reasons why the HP Specter\xa013 x360 can reach  22.5 hours  of battery runtime.  Also Read:  Apple updates it’s Mac mini and MacBook Air for 2018  Talking more about the battery, it stands at  60Wh . In real life usage, HP claims a boost of around 37% over its previous generation. That comes to a total of 22.5 hours, assisted heavily by the low power consumption panel and a pretty power efficient CPU.  Connectivity department also sees a huge improvement, going as far as to add an optional  4G LTE modem . The system does come standard with  Intel Wireless-AC 9560 802.11b/g/n/ac Gigabit Wi-Fi  and  Bluetooth 5  combo. You also get a 3.5mm headphone jack, MicroSD card reader, 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports, 2x USB Type C 3.1 Gen 2 port and 1x USB 3.1 Type A Gen 2 port.   Security was also a priority while designing the laptop. It comes with the usual fingerprint reader, pre-installed TPM module, a SureView privacy display and a mechanical switch that disables the webcam electronically.  HP also announced a 15-inch variant of the HP Spectre 13 x360 that comes with an optional Nvidia GTX 1050Ti MaxQ design for added graphical power but lacks the LTE modem. The bigger one also gets Quad-Speakers, a full Numpad, and a respectable battery life claim of 17.5 hours. It however only comes with a 4k panel and weighs about 2.1Kgs.

Both laptops are pretty great at this point, with HP opting to not just update the internals but also the overall design of the laptop.

Namely known as the  Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the Mate 20 , the new handsets feature three cameras at the back, a powerful processor, and a big battery. And the good news is that among these recently launched two flagships, the premium or the Pro version has finally launched in Nepal for a flagship price.   Huawei Mate 20 Pro Overview  Talking about the specs, the most exciting feature in the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is its camera. As mentioned earlier, the Mate 20 Pro comes with three cameras at the back. But unlike the Huawei P20 Pro, the Mate 20 Pro uses a primary camera backed by an ultra-wide lens and telephoto lens. So users now can not only do the lossless zooming while capturing the images but also can expand the field of view without moving anywhere. On the front, both the camera houses the same 24MP selfie shooter, which is equipped with an f/2.0 lens.         Another cool thing on the phone is its highly powerful  Kirin 980 chipset . This new chipset is designed on 7nm architecture and is said to surpass the Snapdragon 845 on the performance front. Alongside this powerful chipset, the phone is also provided with an ample 128GB of storage. In terms of RAM, the Mate 20 Pro comes with 6GB of memory.   Huawei Mate 20 comes with Android Pie.

(NOT…)'],"['Reviews', 'Xiaomi']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['November 3, 2018']",2018-11-03 13:52:09+00:00,"['The  Xiaomi Redmi 6  is an entry level phone that made quite a bit splash in the smartphone market when it came out. And many have been calling it a king, when it comes to entry level phones. And so, we thought we’d test that theory out. Can it really be called the Entry Level king as others so put it?   Xiaomi Redmi 6 Specifications:   Design : Plastic build  Display : 5.45″ HD+ IPS LCD display (720 x 1440 resolution), 18:9 aspect ratio  Rear Camera : Dual Camera setup, 12 MP primary sensor with PDAF & f/2.2 aperture + 5 MP depth sensor  Front Camera : 5 MP lens  CPU : Octa-core 2.0 GHz MediaTek Helio P22  GPU : PowerVR GE8320  RAM : 3 GB  Storage : 32 GB, 64 GB (expandable up to 256 GB via microSD)  Battery : 3000 mAh  Connectivity : Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2  Ports : microUSB, 3.5 headphone jack  Price in Nepal : Rs.16,490 (32 GB), Rs.18,490 (64 GB)   Design and Build  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 comes with an  all-plastic build . Considering it’s a budget phone, that’s not surprising. The phone appears to be built sturdily when you hold it, but there occur some flex, creaks and squeaks when you abuse the phone a little. Of course, it seems it can withstand minor drops and such.         The design on it is typical Xiaomi. And since it’s a phone from some 3-4 months, back, it looks kind of old, especially when you’re getting used to the notched designs with bigger screens these days. This makes the design look a bit boring, but it is quite practical. The buttons are on the right, but not tactile enough when you press them. The  fingerprint scanner  sits at the right spot – under the cameras. It is easy to reach with your finger at the back, and is also pretty fast and accurate.  The SIM slots and the microSD slot are on the left side. One of the slot houses a SIM and a microSD card, whereas the other is a single SIM slot. The inclusion of a  microSD card slot  is a good option, as the phone only has a  32 GB of storage on-board . But yes, it also comes with a 64 GB version as well.   The speaker is located at the back, which is an unusual place for a speaker to be. It is easy to muffle while laying it on the table, but since the speaker is loud, you can still hear it that way. Vibration, on the other hand, isn’t that strong. It’s easy to miss your calls when walking or riding.  Even though the build is plastic, the phone is pretty slippery. Overall, the design is old school Xiaomi. While it looks kinda practical, its nothing eye-catching .  Yes, this is a budget phone, but the Oppo Real Me 2, also a budget phone, was a bit more eye-catching than this.  Display  Up front, there’s a  5.45” IPS LCD display  with an  18:9 aspect ratio . It has an  HD+ resolution , which may look okay on paper, but it appears inadequate. Especially because you can notice some pixelation at a few points on the screen. Of course, you have to look very closely to be able to see that, but it is quite visible while watching YouTube.   Of course, it is a budget phone, but even on other phones with the same pixel density, I hadn’t faced such problems. So, this can very well be a software or  codec issue  on this unit.  Besides these small problems, the display overall is good enough. Colors are vibrant, and details are represented well enough as well. There is considerable amount of bezels on all sides, but they don’t look too violating.  Camera   In the photography department, this phone comes with a  dual camera setup  at the back, and a single camera in the front. The dual camera setup comprises of a  12 MP primary lens  and a  5 MP depth sensor , both with  f/2.2 aperture .  While the overall image quality from these cameras look good, the pictures lack sharpness. The colors appear a bit cooler, and it could do with a bit more contrast. Also, bright colors appear over-saturated. The dynamic range on this is also only okay at best. It’s because with the HDR mode on, it looks like it does a good job, but the images appear to have been altered with effects.      Xiaomi Redmi 6 Camera Sample   1  of 15               Image has low contrast and looks cool         color representation sample         building         colorful building                low contrast         overlay nature shot         sky hdr         indoor lighting                portrait mode         low light portrait mode         portrait mode indoor         evening         night light                                                         The portrait mode is decent enough. Edge detection, like on other phones, tends to sometimes miss out on the subject. But when it does work, it works pretty well in terms of background blurring and such. However, in low light, the pictures gather a lot of noise. And most of the times, the images come out pretty much unusable. This has to do with the camera’s narrow apertures, but it is what it is.   The  5 MP selfie camera  is better than the rear cameras, achieving good results under good lighting conditions. But sometimes, the AI tends to overdo itself and make your face a bit too artificial, or cartoonish. With that off, it does an okay job, and the bokeh effect on selfies looks better than the one on the back.      Selfie Camera   1  of 4               regular selfie         beauty mode selfie         group selfie         bokeh selfie                        The phone is capable of taking  Full HD videos at 30 fps , and shares the same story just like the pictures. They are usable when taken under good lighting, but are quite grainy in low light.  For a phone in this price range, it does  include EIS , but it’s not that great. Of course, it’s better to have one than none, but you can also turn it off if you wish.  Performance  Here’s the kick to the guts: the  performance on this phone isn’t as good  as expected. For a phone which many claim to be an entry-level killer, it didn’t meet my expectations. Maybe, I had it too high or something, but I was a bit disappointed.  The  Helio P22 chip  on it doesn’t perform as good as it should. Now, I have used a few other phones with the same chipset, and this one doesn’t seem to be at par with them. Even simple tasks such as using YouTube can get some lags. However, it wasn’t like this when I got the phone… this actually started after I updated the phone to the available latest software, i.e.  MIUI 10 .  I also tried PUBG on this, and it did run, with the  BAGT app  helping with the performance and it was playable to an extent. The BAGT app is available in the PlayStore and it will help play heavy games on your phone. Basically, this is a laggy performer in my experience compared to the Realme 2, which came with a Snapdragon 450. So, all I can say is it must be a software issue. I did succeed in playing games like Clash Royale and Pocket Pool but Asphalt 9 was not playable at all.  The UI in this one has been greatly improved and it’s more user friendly now, but the software in general seems to be a lot heavier, especially after the MIUI 10 update I received. It seems to hog down a lot of processing power and memory. Which is why, this phone’s performance was not very good during my review.  It’s added navigation gestures are a breath of fresh air. You swipe up from the bottom to go to the Home Screen, swipe and hold for recent apps, and swipe from left or right to go back. Also, there are little things like brightness slider, and updated settings menu that gives a freshness to the old MIUI 9 that we have used for so long.  However, Xiaomi still needs to optimize its UI by a lot. It may not be a big deal for most high end Xiaomi smartphones, but its not the case for budget smartphones like the Xiaomi Redmi 6.  Connectivity   In terms of connectivity, its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth seem to work fine without any problems. This phone has a headphone jack at the top while it’s  microUSB port  is at the bottom. It misses out on the Gyro-Sensor, and I also faced  issues with the proximity sensor . I found random apps opened after a call was over.  Battery   The  3000 mAh battery  on a phone of this caliber should have been fine, but I didn’t find it satisfactory. Again, that probably had to do with the latest update as the UI is pretty heavy. It gave me around 4 and a half hours of average screen on time. Also, it  takes 2 hours to fully charge , and if we’re nitpicking, the cable is too short.  Also read\xa0 Xiaomi Mobile Price in Nepal  Conclusion  To conclude, as much as many claim this phone to be an entry-level king, I don’t believe it to be so. The Oppo A3s costs a bit more and has only 2 GB RAM with 16 GB storage, but that phone performed better than this one.  But overall, this phone still provides a great value for money. For a  price of Rs.16,500 , you get some of the best basics for a smartphone. I feel like it could’ve performed better if used with the MIUI 9.5 it came with. So, if you can, you should probably hold off on upgrading it the MIUI 10 until Xiaomi can optimize its heavy UI for entry-level phones.  Pros   Low pricing  Okay performance, although could do with a lot of optimization  UI looks pretty engaging   Cons   Display just isn’t sharp enough  Camera isn’t also really a strong point']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/xiaomi-redmi-6-review.jpg']

And the big players in the tech industry like  Samsung  and LG had promised to bring such futuristic phone. But before these tech titans debuted the product, a startup company shocked the world with World’s first foldable smartphone.  The California-based startup company namely known as Royole has been the first in the race of bringing the world’s first foldable smartphone. The smartphone is christened as “FlexPai”, which was unveiled at a conference in Beijing. The phone is actually a phablet with 7.8-inch size when unfolded, just as big as an iPad Mini. This giant screen comes in 4:3 aspect ratio with the resolution of 1920 x 1440 pixels. But when folded, the device can turn into a manageable 4-inch size.  The display on the handset is an  AMOLED panel , which folds down in the middle. The phone is said to come with Dubbed Water OS, which switches the contents to only half of the screen when folded. The other half of the screen displays a wallpaper. When unfolded, the FlexPai measure 7.6mm in terms of thickness. The phone does not fold perfectly flat so the thickness will be more than 15.2mm when folded. Although the device may look cool, it may not still fit into many people’s pockets. Nonetheless, the hinge on this device is rated to being unfolded 200,000 times. So we can consider it durable in that respect.        On the performance front, the FlexPai comes with 7nm Snapdragon 8150 chipset packing either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. Snapdragon 8150 is a unique chipset, whose details have not been mentioned on the website. But the rumors cues that it is a new flagship chipset from Qualcomm (probably for the foldable phones). So if that’s true then we can expect a top-tier performance from the device. In terms of storage, the company has provided three options: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB.  On the camera front, FlexPai enjoys a dual camera setup. The camera pair on the device embraces a 20MP telephoto lens and a 16MP wide-angle lens. Although the capacity of the battery has not been revealed yet, the phone is said to come up with proprietary Ro-Charge fast charging technology, which squeezes the power to the battery from 0% to 80% just in an hour.  128GB and 256GB variants are already available for pre-order in the US. In terms of price, the base variant (6/128GB) comes with the price tag of $1300. And for the 256GB model, the price is set at $1469. All the pre-orders will start shipping in December.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/worlds-first-foldable-smartphone.jpg']

The most-talked-about the\xa0update on the OxygenOS 9.0.2 is definitely the Nightscape mode. Although the feature is still in its infant stage, the results it has produced is quite decent, to say the least.

The device is continuing the sliding mechanism trend that has let the manufacturer make the smartphone bezel-less. One major advantage the Z5 Pro has over the other two phones is certainly the price.  Lenovo Z5 Pro Specifications  A few months back, Lenovo had teased the launch of the Z5 showcasing it to be a bezel-less phone. However, that turned out to be completely false, as the device had a notch and a chin. However, Lenovo seems to have rectified its mistake by launching an actual bezel-less device.         The Lenovo Z5 Pro is a tall smartphone with a 6.39-inch of  Super AMOLED display  that comes in Full HD+ resolution. Lenovo has partnered with Samsung for the display front which is definitely good to see. This display is bordered by a small 2.07 mm of bezels. These bezels have made the Z5 Pro the smartphone with the highest screen-to-body ratio that stands at just 95.06%. This display has an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and is HDR 10 compliant which is nice to see.  Underneath the hood, the Lenovo Z5 Pro has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 chipset that is aided by 6 GB of RAM and Adreno 616 GPU. The device runs on Android v8.1 Oreo with Lenovo’s own ZUI 10 on top. Storage wise, the device is available in 64 GB and 128 GB versions.  In terms of optics, the Lenovo Z5 Pro is equipped with dual 16-megapixel and 24-megapixel cameras accompanied by dual-LED dual-tone flash. The camera setup supports 4K video capture at 30fps. There are also dual cameras up front as the slider reveals 16-megapixel and 8-megapixel selfie cameras.  The slider also has an IR face recognition system embedded.

['ZTE Nubia X launched with two displays and two fingerprint sensors'],"['Nubia', 'ZTE']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['November 1, 2018']",2018-11-01 07:47:32+00:00,"['Since the start of the trend of the bezel-less design, smartphone manufacturers have gone really far.  Essential PH-1  brought the concept of the notch to put the camera, which did not look much appealing. So Vivo brought the  Vivo Nex  with motorized selfie camera. It created hype for some time but the hype slowly faded away when Oppo brought  Oppo Find X . The Find X introduced a sliding camera eliminating notch and bezels on the top. Motorized camera and the sliding camera did look innovative but it also raised the question of reliability over time. When the question remains still unanswered, another Chinese company stepped up to annihilate the notch trend completely without the inclusion of the flashy motorized or sliding camera. For the purpose, the smartphone maker brought ZTE Nubia X smartphone in which it removed the front camera altogether.   ZTE Nubia X Overview  The phone comes with the 6.26-inch IPS display on the front, which features an incredible 93.6% screen-to-body ratio. And as I mentioned earlier, the phone is notch-less. Bezels on the phone also look nonexistent. This has been possible because ZTE has not included the front camera on the handset. The phone only comes with a  dual camera setup  at the back. Instead of the selfie camera, ZTE has rather included a secondary display on the back, which can be used while taking selfies. The secondary display uses a 5.1-inch OLED panel, which can be turned off to save the power when not in use. Since the secondary display is blended inside the glass back, nobody can notice it when the screen is off. And good thing is that both the displays are shielded with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 to avoid scratches and cracks during the falls.         Dual screen is not the only interesting feature on the smartphone. The phone also comes with a dual fingerprint sensor and it is mounted on both the sides. So whichever be the side the user is using the device, they can unlock the phone without any hassle.   Talking about the optics, the camera on the handset is a combination of 16MP, f/1.7 camera backed by a 24MP, f/1.7 to improve the performance in low light settings. With this setup, we can expect the phone to capture amazing images. And since these cameras will be used even for the selfies, selfies too is surely going to sharp, vibrant and lively.   On the performance front, the handset boasts the flagship Snapdragon 845 chipset with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM alongside. In terms of memory, the phone comes in three storage formats: 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. Talking about the battery, the phone boasts a 3800mAh battery, which is non-removable in nature. The phone also supports Quick Charge 4.0, so the ZTE Nubia X is surely going to charge up really fast.  ZTE Nubia X Specifications   Dimensions:  1 x 73.3 x 8.4 mm;  Weight : 181 grams  Display : 6.26 inches IPS LCD (primary) + 5.1 inches OLED (Secondary) with Gorilla Glass 3 protection on both sides  Resolution:  2280 × 1080 pixels with 19:9 aspect ratio, 403PPI (primary) + 1520 × 720 pixels with 19:9 aspect ratio, 330 PPI (secondary)  Chipset:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845  CPU : 4 × Kryo 385 Gold @ 2.65 GHz + 4 × Kryo 385 Silver @ 1.80 GHz  GPU : Adreno 630  RAM : 6GB or 8GB  Storage : 64GB/128GB/256GB, No SD card slot for memory expansion  Rear Camera : (24 MP, f/1.7, PDAF) + (16 MP, f/1.8, PDAF), Dual-LED (dual-tone) flash  Front Camera:  No Front camera  Connectivity:  Dual SIM (Nano SIM), Dual 4G, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5.0, No 3.5mm headphone jack, USB Type-C  Battery:  3,800 mAh, supports Quick Charge 4.0 (9V/2A or 18W)  Sensors:  Dual fingerprint (side-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Price (6GB/64GB, Gray & Black) : 3299 Yuan (Approx. $475 or NPR 56, 100)  Price (6GB/64GB, Blue):  3399 Yuan (Approx. $490 or NPR 57,800)  Price (8GB/128GB, Gray & Black) : 3699 Yuan (Approx. $531 or NPR 62,900)  Price (8GB/128GB, Blue) : 3799 Yuan (Approx. $545 or NPR 64,600)  Price (8GB/256GB, Gray & Black) : 4199 Yuan (Approx. $603 or NPR 71,400)  Price (8GB/256GB, Blue) : 4299 Yuan (Approx. $617 or NPR 73,100)   ZTE Nubia X Price and Availability  ZTE has only announced its availability in China as of now and it will go on sale starting from November 5th.

['Finally! The new Apple MacBook Air is here'],"['Apple', 'MacBook']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['October 31, 2018']",2018-10-31 11:27:18+00:00,"['Many will argue that the  Apple MacBook Air  was the turning point in the history of laptops. A heavy statement, but true nonetheless. It was the first ultrathin laptop with an amazing build and a great performer too. Then came “just Macbook” with it’s even thinner, lightweight fanless design with just one USB C port. That’s when all hopes were lost for another MacBook Air refresh, up until yesterday. And in this article, I will be discussing all the best features inside the new Apple MacBook Air 2018.  The new MacBook Air brings everything to the table. Starting with a 13.3″ 2560 x 1600 Retina Display that cuts the screen bezels by over 50% (compared to its predecessor). The laptop looks a lot better now with glass\xa0covering the whole screen up to the edges. Apple even claims it can show up to\xa048% more colors compared to its previous generation.  Also Read:  Apple launches two iPad Pros with all new looks        Apple gave up on the TouchID for its smartphones and tablets but seems like it’s a new feature for the MacBook Air. You can also use it for Apple Pay, secure your laptop logins and even secure password protected documents. It also comes with the second generation of Apple’s T2 security chip.  MacBooks always had great keyboards, apart from a few generations in between. For this one, Apple is pretty sure that the new generation of the butterfly mechanism\xa0keyboard is better, and by a lot. They provide four times more key stability along with more comfort and responsiveness. The keys are individually backlit and come with an ambient\xa0light sensor to help with low-light typing.  The Force Touch Trackpad is now 20% larger, much more precise and a lot more pressure sensitive. There are two Thunderbolt 3 ports for data transfers, charging, plug in an external display or even an external GPU. The speakers deliver twice as much bass and 25% more volume. Then there is the new HD webcam with three microphones which should result in much better Facetime sessions.  The new MacBook Air comes with Intel’s\xa0 8th Gen Core i5  processor which can go up to\xa03.6GHz. The laptop is configurable of up to  16GB  of RAM and  1.5TB  of storage, although that will also bump up the price to  $2,599 . The base version with  8GB  of RAM and  128GB  of storage comes in at  $1,199 . There are no dedicated graphics solutions and all variants only come with the  Intel UHD 617  integrated graphics.   The laptop weighs in at just 1.25kgs with a thickness of 0.61″. The frame itself is built from 100% recycled aluminum which emits 47% less carbon emission in the manufacturing process. The 6000 series of aluminum used should also provide an ample amount of strength and durability. Even with those levels of thinness, however, Apple still claims up to 12 hours of wireless web browsing and 13 hours of iTunes movie playback (50.3Whr).  But most people who will be buying this laptop won’t buy it for the above reasons. The main reason they will is the macOS operating system. The new macOS Mojave is the latest version of OS from Apple for Macs. There is a huge selection of features and improvements, not to mention all the new built-in apps, redesigned Mac App Store, Dark Mode, dynamic desktop, stacks, and a bunch of other features on top of the much loved operating system.  In the box, you get the MacBook Air itself, a 2-meter USB-C charger and a 30W power adapter. There are three color options that include Gold, Silver, and Space Gray. We did hear a lot of rumors about a cheaper MacBook Air, but all that was put into rest when the pricing of the base model was revealed at  $1,199 . It’s a bit overpriced if you ask us, especially for just 128GB of storage. But we will let you guys decide if this one is a value for money productivity system or just an over expensive glorified web browsing machine.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/macbook-air.jpg']

The MacBook Air got refreshed with a Retina display and more. The Mac Mini also saw some considerable updates after quite some time. But I think, the elephant in the room here, are the two new iPad Pros. The Apple iPad Pro 2018 are the 2018 iterations of last years 2017 models. But unlike the S versions of the  iPhone X , these ones feature considerable upgrades and brand new designs.  The new iPad Pros are the  iPad Pro 11″ 2018 , and the  iPad Pro 12.9″ 2018 . These new models are the descendants to the 10.5″ iPad Pro and 12.9″ iPad Pro of 2017 respectively.  Both the iPad Pros come with  Liquid Retina displays , which is of course, Apple’s fancy way of saying IPS LCDs. However, displays on Apple devices are always one of a kind. Both these iPad Pros have the same internal specs. The new iPad Pros are powered by the  octa-core A12X CPU , which is an insanely powerful chip. Now, these are Apple’s first ever 8-core SoCs, and has  4 high-power Vortex cores  with  4 efficient, low-power Tempest cores . The company claims 35% faster single-core performance and 90% faster multi-core performance.         Also, these iPads also have the new  7-core A12 GPU s, which Apple claims provides twice the graphical performance from the last generation iPads. Now, that may be cool and all, but I still can’t think of why that may be that necessary. But hey, it’s super-cool to have that much power in your hands. They also run on the new  iOS 12.1  and feature all the cool gesture controls and such as well.  While people may not care about cameras on Android tablets, the cameras on iPads are kind of a big deal, however. They feature a  12 MP rear camera  with an  f/1.8 aperture and PDAF along with features like Smart HDR, Wide Color Gamut, and Retina Flash . The front camera is essentially the same to last years – a  7 MP shooter with f/2.2 aperture  and the same features like the 2017 model as well.  In addition, another eye-catching things about these new iPad Pros are their designs. These iPads have ditched their old designs, and sport new looks with rounded corners, thinner bezels and slightly slimmer bodies. Also, Apple wouldn’t be Apple if they didn’t remove certain features during major upgrades in their devices.  Gone is the home button , and the headphone jack as well. And while the loss of the headphone jack will be mourned, Apple doing it has ceased to be a big deal these days, anyway!\xa0However, a welcome change is that the iPad Pro, now, has a  USB-C connector  replacing the old Lightning one.\xa0And also, due to the reduced bezels, and the lack of a home button, these iPad Pros, now  feature Face ID .   The iPad Pro 11″ has, more or less, the same form factor as last year’s 10.5″ iPad Pro. It features a  2388 x 1668 resolution  this time around, and is 0.2 mm slimmer than last year’s iPad. This means that the new 11″ iPad Pro gets a slightly larger screen to body aspect ratio at 12.9:9. It has  a battery of 29.37 Watt-hours .   The 12.9″ model, however, is now smaller and more portable than last year’s iPad Pro of the same. This 2018 version has lesser bezels and is  15% thinner , meaning it’s only 5.9 mm thick! That’s super slim and portable. The screen resolution, though, stays the same. Also, it sports a  36.71 Watt-hour battery .

These new iPad Pros are both available on four storage options:  64 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB  and  1 TB . I would’ve liked to see a 128 GB as the base model version, but of course, it’s just Apple being Apple. However, there are Wi-Fi only and LTE variants to these iPad Pros as well. As for the prices, they are listed below:      iPad Pro 11″ 2018  64 GB  256 GB  512 GB  1 TB    Wi-Fi only  $749  $949  $1149  $1549    Wi-Fi + LTE  $949  $1099  $1299  $1699          iPad Pro 12.9″ 2018  64 GB  256 GB  512 GB  1 TB    Wi-Fi only  $999  $1149  $1349  $1749    Wi-Fi + LTE  $1149  $1299  $1499  $1899      Now, besides the prices listed here, you might also have to get a USB-C to 3.5 mm jack adapter that cost some $9. Also, if you want the Apple Pencil, that will be another $129. And this time around, the second generation  Apple Pencil has wireless charging . It just sticks to your iPad Pro, and starts charging. And of course, the pencil comes with it’s own set of cool features to do stuff.  Also read \xa0 iPhone Price in Nepal  So, what do you think about the new iPad Pros?

What this software will do is a few things, one of which keeps your graphics driver up to date.  ALWAYS KEEP YOUR GRAPHICS DRIVERS UPDATED , no matter if you are on Team Red or Team Green. Back to GeForce experience, you get game optimization which sets the right settings for each game for your graphics card. It doesn’t always work but could be a lifesaver in a lot of cases.  Then there is the in-game overlay that lets you show FPS, live broadcast your games (might want to do a bit more research for this), screen recording and instant replay. The game stream function, whisper mode, and battery booster are also pretty helpful if your GPU supports them.  Download Geforce Experience  Steam  This list will include a few other apps just like Steam, but this one is the King of all. Honestly, if you do not know steam you are in for one of the most exciting moments of your gaming life. Although if you plan on not paying for your games you might as well skip to the 4th point. What Steam is, is basically a gaming library that lets you select from a total of  781 million games  both paid and free.\xa0  Just open up the app and you will enter a world with AAA titles like PUBG, Tomb Raider, Minecraft Story Mode, CS: GO, Dota 2, Witcher III, the Call of Duty series, No Man’s Sky, and lots of other countless hours of pure joy.

Just a quick guide to all these stores:  Origin  has the FIFA series,  EPIC  is basically all Fortnite,  Uplay  has the Watchdog and Assassins Creed. The  GOG.com  can show off it’s few fantasy role-playing games.  Blizzard Entertainment  previously known as Battle.net is well known for Overwatch and finally, Microsoft bought Minecraft.

So, we highly  DO NOT PROMOTE PIRACY OR ILLEGAL DOWNLOADING OF GAMES  but most people also shell out the money if they like a game that they pirated at first. Either way, try not to download games this way and  support the developers .  Discord   There is a huge selection of apps just like discord but I found that this one was more user-friendly. Also, most of the friends in my gaming circle are already using this so why go for something else. So, what is Discord? It’s basically a communication app for gamers.

The company then launched the 5T which was a considerable upgrade over the OnePlus 5. Like the previous years, this year too its new member the 6T is here, which is the successor to the widely popular  OnePlus 6 . And this new phone will probably be one of the most polarizing smartphones right now. Here’s everything you need to know about the newly launched OnePlus 6T.  Headphone Jack  Now, this heading might come as a surprise to some, but I have to talk about it here. OnePlus had run a couple of polls asking its followers on how important they found the headphone jack to be several months back. But with the 6T, the company has completely ditched it, mentioning this was done to free up space for a new technology. OnePlus has already come under huge criticism with this decision but buyers will get a dongle inside their box.  In-display fingerprint scanner         The technology that led to the lack of headphone jack on the OnePlus 6T is the in-display fingerprint scanner. Like some of the devices from Oppo and Vivo, this device too houses the sensor that is placed under the large display. It has been claimed that it will be able to unlock the phone in around 0.34 seconds. So, it will be interesting to see how fast this scanner is in real life. OnePlus also claimed that this technology was in stores since the  OnePlus 5T , but the company found it to be a little slow for its taste then.  Battery  The battery front is one of the major areas where the OnePlus 6T has had an update over the 6. The device now comes with a 3,700 mAh battery which is certainly a welcome move. OnePlus had been stuffing a 3,300 mAh battery inside a number of its phones in the past.  That battery is coupled with OnePlus Fast Charge, the new substituted name for Dash Charge. It will be interesting to see how the charger holds up with the larger sized battery.  Camera  The OnePlus 6T comes with a similar camera setup like its predecessor, but a few features have been added to it. The camera app will come with Scene Recognition feature which will understand the surrounding and apply the necessary settings.  Like all the smartphones of the present time, OnePlus has taken its own approach to perfect night shots with its new Night Scape feature. This feature takes various aspects (HDR, details optimization, noise reduction, and multi-frame stabilization) into consideration to capture a good night-time image. This feature will also be available on the OnePlus 6.  The company also talked about the new Studio Lighting feature which helps take better portrait shots.  Software  OnePlus had claimed “a whole new UI” with the 6T, but even with the over 800 optimizations claim, that was not the case. However, users will like the Full-Screen Gesture 2.0 which now will let you switch between the recently used applications.  Display   On the front, the OnePlus 6T now has a depleted chin and a tiny notch which is shaped like a waterdrop. And as the notch shrunk on the 6T, the phone had to bid farewell to the notification LED. This notch is surrounded by the Full HD display which OnePlus has been opting for since the OnePlus One. This time though, the screen is the tallest one on any OnePlus phone measuring 6.41-inch with 19.5:9 aspect ratio. It is protected by  Corning Gorilla Glass 6 .  OnePlus 6T Specifications:   Display : 6.41-inch Full HD+ Optic AMOLED; 19.5:9 aspect ratio, Corning Gorilla Glass 6  CPU : Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 845  OS : Android Pie (v9.0) with OxygenOS on the top  RAM : 6/8 GB  GPU : Adreno 630  Storage : 128/256 GB  Rear Camera : 16MP (f/1.7, 1.22µm, EIS, OIS) + 20MP (f/1.7,\xa01.0µm), PDAF, dual-LED flash with Scene Recognition  Front Camera : 16 MP front-facing camera, f/2.0 aperture  Sensors : In-display Fingerprint, Accelerometer, Gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:\xa0 Dual SIM with 4G  Color Variant(s):\xa0 Mirror Black, Midnight Black  Battery:  3,700 mAh with Fast Charge (5V/4A)   OnePlus 6T Price in Nepal and Availability  In terms of pricing, the OnePlus 6T will go on sale for the starting price of $549 internationally for the 6/128 GB version. It will go on sale starting 1st November on T-Mobile’s store, while OnePlus will be selling it from its official website from the 6th of November. The 8/128 GB variant will be available for $579 whereas the highest-end one, the 8/256 GB is priced at $629.  It has already been confirmed that the OnePlus 6T will be available in Nepal starting the  11.11 sales Day of Daraz . The expected price of this device is around Rs. 70,000 to Rs. 72,000.

['Lenovo launches two new phones in Nepal'],['Lenovo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['October 29, 2018']",2018-10-29 13:42:13+00:00,"['Now Lenovo might not be the go-to phone in the Nepali market now. But there was a time when Lenovo was also a popular smartphone brand. And now, maybe the company is looking to make a comeback. And so, Lenovo launches two new phones in Nepal, namely, the Lenovo K5 Play and the Lenovo S5.  Lenovo K5 Play Overview  The Lenovo K5 Play is a relatively new smartphone in the market. The international market saw the phone a while ago in April, and it is here in Nepal now. This budget phone does have some compelling features for its price as well, and with that, it might be looking to set itself as an Entry Level go-to device.  The K5 Play features a  5.7″ Max Vision Display  (as Lenovo calls it). The resolution is only HD+ with  720 x 1440 pixels , but it is a budget phone. Since it launched a few months back, it hasn’t caught on the notch trend of 2018. So, it has bezels on the top and bottom, but the sides are practically bezel-less.         It packs a dual camera setup at the back, which comprises of a  13 MP primary sensor with f/2.2 aperture  and a  2 MP depth sensor . The selfie camera rests at  8 MP . While that may be not as appealing, it certainly seems well enough for a budget phone. Under the hood, this phone runs on an  Octa-core Snapdragon 430  chip coupled with  3 GB of RAM . While the international market also gets a 2 GB RAM variant, we, in Nepal, do not.  Also, the phone has  32 GB storage  and is expandable up to 128 GB via microSD. In addition, you also get a fingerprint sensor at the back, which is a must-have feature these days. This phone is priced at  Rs.17,999  in Nepal.  Lenovo K5 Play Specifications:   Design:\xa0 Polymer Glass  Display:\xa0 5.7″ IPS LCD display with HD+ resolution (720 x 1440 pixels)  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual Camera setup, 13 MP with f/2.2 aperture + 2 MP depth sensor  Front Camera:\xa0 8 MP with f/2.0 aperture  Chipset:\xa0 Octa-core Snapdragon 430 chip  RAM:\xa0 3 GB  Platform:\xa0 Android 8.0 Oreo  Storage:\xa0 32 GB internal (expandable up to 128 GB via microSD  Battery:\xa0 3030 mAh  Price in Nepal:\xa0 Rs.17,999   Also Read:\xa0 Lenovo Mobile Price in Nepal  Lenovo S5 Overview  The Lenovo S5 looks like its getting ready to compete in the mid-range department in Nepal. A phone which also launched back in March for international markets, this phone is now making its way here.  This phone comes with an all-metal build, giving a premium finish design. So, it is also one of those phones which is not on-board the notch train. There are bezels on the top and bottom, with pretty much non-existent bezels on the sides. It also features a  5.7″ IPS LCD display  but has a  Full HD+ panel at 1080 x 2160 resolution . Lenovo also calls it the Max Vision display, but since the term goes for both HD+ and FHD+, it is a confusing term.   This phone, too, packs a dual camera at the back. It features a  13 MP primary camera with f/2.2 aperture  and PDAF, while the secondary camera is a  13 MP monochrome sensor , which is helpful in gathering more light from the surroundings. The selfie camera measures  a good 16 MP .  Inside the skin, an  Octa-core Snapdragon 625  powers the phone. While it may be a bit underwhelming, it should perform good enough combined with a  4 GB RAM . It packs  64 GB of storage , which is expandable up to 128 GB with microSD. The phone also has a fingerprint sensor at the back. Also, the phone packs a  3000 mAh battery.\xa0 Also, this phone is priced at  Rs.26,999 , which, in 2018, belongs to the lower midrange section in Nepal.  Lenovo S5 Specifications:   Design:\xa0 Full Metal design  Display:\xa0 5.7″ IPS LCD Full HD+ Max Vision Display (1080\xa0 x 2160) resolution  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual lens setup, 13 MP primary with f/2.2 aperture + 13 MP monochrome sensor  Front Camera:\xa0 16 MP lens with f/2.2 aperture  Chipset:\xa0 Octa-core Snapdragon 625  RAM:\xa0 4 GB  Platform:\xa0 Android 8.0 Oreo  Storage:\xa0 64 GB (expandable up to 128 GB via microSD)  Battery:\xa0 3000 mAh  Price in Nepal:\xa0 Rs.26,999   These phones are now launched under  Ambe Mobiles Pvt.

They also come with impressive internals, adequate RGB lightings, and lots of configurable options. But the new Dell Alienware m15 shatters most of those\xa0stereotypes, with a thin, light, and seriously good-looking laptop. Plus, going by all the reviews we have seen, it allegedly stays pretty cool too.  Dell Alienware m15 Key Specifications:   8th Gen Intel Core i7-8750H 6-core processor  Up to 15.6″ UHD display  Up to 32GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM (2x16GB)  up to 2x1TB PCIe M.2 SSD  Up to NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Max-Q design  Killer 1550 802.11ac 2×2 WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0   Display  The Alienware M15 is currently available in 15″ variant available in an FHD 60Hz for the 1060 OC GPU. The one with 1070 gets either an FHD 144Hz display or the 4k 60Hz one. Although here, the FHD panel’s brightness caps out at just 300nits and 72% of sRGB color gamut. If you want the full 100% color gamut, you will need to shell out the extra for the 4k one, which also bumps the brightness to 400nits.\xa0The bezels have also been decreased significantly.  Performance  All of the options come with the same processor, Intel’s Core i7-8750H with 6 cores and 12 threads. With 9MB of cache size and up to\xa04.1GHz turbo boost clock speeds, it’s one of the best mobile processors on the market. Yes, there is the i9 too, but it’s currently not available but should launch very soon.\xa0        As for RAM and storage, you get up to 32GB of dual channel 2666mHz memory option. There there are all the storage options, which you can configure to a maximum of two 1TB PCIe M.2 SSD. There are obviously options to put in an SSHD and Intel’s Optane SSD as well.  Gaming performance  There are two graphics options, one with a GTX1060 OC and another with the 1070 Max Q design. For obvious reasons, the screen resolution and Hertz are capped out according to your choice of graphics memory. The GTX 1060 comes with 6GB of GDDR5 memory whereas the GTX 1070 comes with 8GB of GDDR5 memory. Either way, both will deliver smooth gaming experience, and from what we hear, it runs pretty cold as well thanks to the Alienware Cryo Tech v2.0.   The motherboard in use here is Intel’s Mobile CM346 Chipset. It comes with a Killer 1550 802.11ac 2×2 WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0. There are two battery options, one is 60W and the other a 90W. You get a 180W power adapter, along with port selections like Alienware’s proprietary graphics amplifier port, Thunderbolt 3 port, Superspeed USB 3.1 ports, and a few other essentials. There are two color options including an Epic Silver and a new Nebula Red.  Dell Alienware m15 Price in Nepal & Availability  The Dell Alienware M15 price starts from $1,379.99. As for availability in Nepal, the Alienware M15 is available in Nepal for the starting price of Rs. 2,20,000 from laptop stores like ITTI and Bigbyte.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/alineware-m15-2018.jpg']

['Xiaomi MI A2 Review: A mid-ranger close to perfection?'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Xiaomi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 26, 2018']",2018-10-26 11:40:25+00:00,"['The  Xiaomi Mi A1  was the first collaboration between Android and Xiaomi. It was Xiaomi’s first take on the Android One platform, and it paid off well for the Chinese company. With the successor MI A2, Xiaomi is trying to emulate the success as its predecessor by offering pretty capable specs at a midrange price. So, let’s find how the  Xiaomi MI A2  stacks up against today’s competition.   Xiaomi MI A2 Specifications:   Display:\xa0 5.99-inch LTPS LCD display, 2.5D curved glass with Gorilla Glass 5 protection  Resolution: Full-HD+ (2160×1080 pixels), 18:9 aspect ratio, 403 PPI  OS:\xa0 Android 8.1 (Oreo) Android One  Chipset: \xa0Qualcomm\xa0Snapdragon 660  CPU:\xa0 4 x 2.2GHz Kryo 260 + 4 x 1.8GHz Kryo 260  GPU :\xa0Adreno 512 GPU  RAM:\xa0 4GB  Storage:\xa0 64GB; No SD card slot for memory expansion  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual camera – (12 MP, f/1.8, 1/2.9″, 1.25µm) + (20 MP, f/1.8, 1/2.8″, 1.0µm, PDAF), Dual-LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 20 MP, f/2.2, 1/2.8″, 1.0µm, soft LED flash  Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Infrared Port : Yes  SIM: Hybrid Dual SIM (nano + nano / microSD)  Connectivity:\xa0 Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 ac (2.4GHz / 5GHz), Bluetooth 5 LE, GPS + GLONASS,\xa0USB Type-C, no headphone jack  Dimensions:\xa0 7×75.4×7.3mm; Weight: 168g  Battery:\xa0 3010mAh with quick charge 3.0  Colors:\xa0 Blue, Gold, and Black  Price : Rs. 30,999 for 4/64GB (free soft case + Type-C Dongle)   Design  Right off the back, I have to say that the Mi A2 feels very premium. The slim, light and sleek body with the metallic back looks great. Now even though its counterparts like say  OPPO F9  or  Huawei Nova 3i  come with glass back or uniquely designed backs, the device has followed the footsteps of the A1 for the back material.         The metal back also has advantages as glass backs are fragile. So, the overall design and the fact that it is really light and thin really impressed me.   Display  Upfront, you get a 6-inch IPS LCD panel. Like with every phone at this price range, you get a Full-HD+ resolution and an 18:9 aspect ratio. The display here is sharp, but since I recently reviewed the Oppo F9 and the Nova 3i, you could easily notice that it’s not quite bright and it obviously suffers under sunlight as well.   Talking about the colors here, well, it is not that accurate and looks a bit dull for me. So, if you are someone who is into the multimedia experience on your smartphone, you might want to look elsewhere.\xa0The plus point, however, is the protection. With Gorilla Glass 5 at the helm, it hasn’t suffered from any sort of major scratch during my 1 month of use.  Camera  The camera is the aspect, where the MI A2 truly shines. The phone features a dual camera setup on the back, which is the combination of 12MP and 20MP sensors. The Mi A1 was not that good of a camera phone, and the Mi A2 claimed that it had improved considerably.      xiaomi mi a2 camera sample   1  of 11                                                                                                                                I did take plentiful images during my review period. And the images so captured were really great. The Mi A2 definitely comes out on the top on a lot of scenarios, and considering its price tag, the camera performance is impressive. The phone captures quite decent images with great details and sharpness. Dynamic range and color accuracy are also good.\xa0The secondary camera on the rear side helps with better low-light images due to its wide aperture. And that’s definitely the case here as the pictures look true to life.        1  of 3                                                The portrait shots from the rear cameras will also impress you. They have good edge detection and the amount of blur looks natural in them. But, to get better portrait shots, the subject must be at a suitable distance from the camera and there must be a fair amount of light.\xa0Portrait images in low light settings lack proper edge detection and overall, images do not look very appealing.        1  of 2                                      As for the selfie camera, the MI A2 has received a huge upgrade over its predecessor. The phone comes with a 20MP camera, which not only boasts high megapixel count but also promises better quality in the images. And the images captured from the phone speak for themselves.\xa0The selfie camera also has a portrait mode which is purely software. However, it is not that great as the back camera it fails to detect the edges properly.                   In terms of videography, the Xiaomi MI A2 can shoot 1080 and 4K videos at 30 fps. The phone lacks OIS but it does have EIS to make up for it. EIS does a better job while shooting 1080P videos, but fails to work while shooting in 4K.  To check out all the images in high resolution,\xa0 Click here .  Software  The software here is the pure form of android. Yes, there are some preinstalled Mi apps, but apart from that, the phone looks really clean. This is exactly what I like. It’s currently on Oreo 8.1 and Xiaomi has already promised the Android Pie update.\xa0I did receive an update for software improvements, but Android Pie is not yet here. I was expecting the device to be one of the first to receive it, but that has not been the case here.  Performance  Now, the performance. Xiaomi’s smartphones excel in the performance aspect and the MI A2 is no exception. This phone truly rocks with the  Snapdragon 660 chipset . Combined with the stock android, it easily handles almost all of the tasks thrown at it. Running and multitasking light apps and games is blazing fast. The apps and games open and load quite fast after you start them.  It can also run high-end games smoothly too. I played high-end games like Dead Effect 2, Overkill 3, Asphalt 9, and Galaxy on Fire 2. And all of them ran pretty well. It also runs PUBG in medium settings, and without any lags or stutters.  And If you compare the Mi A2 against other smartphones of its price range, you’ll see that it excels more than the others, and one of the examples are benchmarks. The GPU also stands out as the Adreno 512 GPU is quite a bit faster than its competitors.  In terms of RAM and storage, there are several variants available. But the review unit I got had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. And that’s all. Note that it does not have a micro SD card slot. So, you will not be able to expand the internal storage any further. Although 64GB of memory is enough for me, it might not be enough for some.  Connectivity  Also, the phone doesn’t have the 3.5mm headphone jack. So, I was forced to use the USB Type C to 3.5mm headphone jack dongle to connect with my headphone.\xa0The dongle which by the way comes with the phone is tiny, so I misplaced quite easily And yes, there’s the hassle of having to carry one at all times.   Other than that, I am fairly impressed with the connectivity on the handset. I did not face any issue while browsing the internet on both the Wi-Fi and the mobile data. And talking about the phone calls, I used both the NTC and Ncell SIM cards on the phone and the cellular reception and the call quality was great.  Battery  Another thing I didn’t like about the Mi A2 is the battery. Massive batteries on its phones are one of the Xiaomi’s fortes. However, that lacked in the MI A1 and it continues in the MI A2, and this time I blame the slim and trim design for it.\xa0The phone comes with a relatively smaller 3010mAh battery, which struggles to provide a backup for a day even on the normal use.   Initially, during my review period, the phone used to get drained really fast even when left idle. I found out that this issue was because of the bug on the fingerprint sensor. With this bug, the CPU gets clocked at maximum speed and it consumes more power. After knowing about the bug, I disabled the fingerprint sensor and since then I have not encountered such fast battery draining issue. But still, it has not been able to provide backup for one complete day. And the problem could be fixed with later software updates. For now, there’s no word on it.  And talking about the battery charging time, the phone gets fully refilled in 1 hour and 45 minutes with its 5V / 2A stock charger.\xa0As the phone claims to support fast charging, I tried using other fast chargers as well. But I didn’t find any significant difference in charging speeds.  Verdict  To sum it up, the MI A2 is a great phone for its price. The capable chipset, good design and a remarkable set of cameras are the best things about this phone. And the presence of the stock Android is surely the icing on the cake.  That being said, the handset is not perfect by any means. An average display, a smaller battery, no microSD card slot and the lack of 3.5mm headphone are few downsides the phone offers. Other than that, I think for 250 dollars or Rs. 31,000 in Nepal, it’s a great value for money.  So, what do you think about the Xiaomi MI A2? Can you live with its downsides or would you skip this one and choose another? Do let us know in the comments.  Pros   Capable Processor  Remarkable camera  Great design   Cons   Smaller battery  No SD card slot  No headphone jack']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Xiaomi-Mi-A2-Review.jpg']

Google looks set to change all of that with an agreement that requires OEMs to provide security updates to its users for at least two years.  According to a contract obtained by The Verge, Google has now made a contract with Android phones and tablet manufacturers that states that the second party must provide four security updates in its first year, and that has been set as the bare minimum. In the second year, manufacturers will be required to provide the updates, but Google hasn’t exactly specified the exact number.  This contract is applicable for the tablets and smartphones launched after 31 st  January 2018. Google has made this mandatory for the devices that have at least 100,000 users. After 31 st  January 2019, all devices that come under the company’s “security mandatory models” will be in line to receive the security updates.        Google recently had to change some of its business and working model in the European Union (EU). According to The Verge, this contract’s terms appear in the same licensing agreement with the EU.  Likewise, the Californian company will also make sure that the updates received by the devices are under 90 days old. Google will be able to “withhold approval of future phones”, which will definitely come as a bummer for the companies.  This move from Google will definitely be welcomed by all Android users. It comes at a time when the Android world is fragmented into bits and pieces, and it’s good that the company has finally taken this initiation.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/google-security-updates-mandatory.jpg']

Phones ranging from low-range to high-range price segment come with processors that help run the technology.\xa0MediaTek has been making AI-supported chipsets for a while now, and the company has announced its new product that provides a 13% increase in performance all while boosting the AI technology by 10-30%. The new chipset is the MediaTek Helio P70, that is the successor of the  Helio P60  which is powering a lot of mid-range smartphones right now.  The Helio P70 has a few updates and upgrades over its predecessor, but it comes in the same  12nm form factor . It has the same octa-core processors with the same four ARM Cortex A73 that has an upped clock speed of 2.1 GHz. The other four Cortex A53 cores have a clock speed of 2.0 GHz.  The Helio P60 is a well-performing chipset by all means. Helio P60 had done an impressive job on the  Oppo F7 ,  Oppo F9 ,  Vivo V11 , and many other handsets when it comes to real to real life usage. However, the devices powered by it faces a couple of stutters a couple of times while gaming. MediaTek has optimized the P70 to fix all of those issues and improve the overall gaming performance on the phones.        Likewise, the Helio P70 comes with CorePilot 4.0 that conducts thermal management for a cooler user experience. This technology also helps with a better battery life on the smartphones.  In terms of connectivity, the Helio P70 comes with a faster connection speed without a significant decrease in battery life.  The new chipset from MediaTek will let the devices equip dual rear-facing cameras measuring 24-megapixel and 16-megapixel, or just a 32-megapixel single camera. The camera(s) will let users capture better HDR-enhanced photos with extra details.  It looks as though MediaTek is focusing on the Helio P70 now. We could see smartphones running on the new platform in November.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MediaTek-Helio-P70.jpg']

"['Samsung Galaxy A7 2018 Review – High Expectations, Okay Delivery']","['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['October 17, 2018']",2018-10-17 05:53:23+00:00,"['Few smartphones as of date have stepped into the Triple Camera territory.  Huawei P20 Pro  started the trend, and now some other smartphones are following suit. The  LG V40  which was recently unveiled has the triple camera as well. And now, I guess, it’s Samsung’s turn. But while other smartphones are putting those triple cameras on their flagships, Samsung decided to experiment with it on its mid-range device, which is the Samsung Galaxy A7 2018. But let’s also see what else it’s got besides the triple camera setup.   Samsung Galaxy A7 2018 Specifications:   Design : Glass back and front in Aluminum Frame, Corning Gorilla Glass protection  Display : 6.0″ Super AMOLED, Full HD+ resolution (2220 x 1080) pixels, 410 PPI pixel density  Rear Camera : Triple cameras, 24 MP primary lens with f/1.7 aperture & PDAF + 5 MP depth sensor + 8 MP Ultra-Wide Angle lens with f/2.4 aperture, capable of 1080p videos @30 fps with EIS  Front Camera : 24 MP lens with f/2.0 aperture  Chipset : Exynos 7885  CPU : Octa-core 2.2 GHz Cortex A-53  RAM:  4 GB  Storage : 64 GB internal, expandable up to 512 GB via microSD (dedicated slot)  Battery : 3300 mAh  Price : Rs.42,990   Design         Samsung devices have the kind of design that literally scream Samsung. Slightly rounded corners on a sleek looking body, and bezels on the front. So, the A7 2018 sports a similar design. It has glass front and back that sandwiches an aluminum frame in between. The phone, although having a glass back, doesn’t quite have the heft to it, i.e. feels kind of light on the hands. I was surprised due to this, because it’s lighter than the Nokia 6.1 Plus even, which is smaller in size. And it also makes me feel like it’s plastic, but it’s so much glass like, that I think it is a glass back.  And the phone is a fingerprint magnet, and it’s slippery too. The glossy finish at the back looks premium, but due to its light weight, it doesn’t feel that way.   The back houses the triple cameras on the side, which protrudes out ever so slightly. The speaker is on the bottom right, which is quite easy to muffle out while gaming or watching media. So, it’s a good thing that there’s also a secondary speaker on the ear-piece. Also, there’s no fingerprint sensor at the back. And that’s because it’s embedded in the power button, which is on the right. The volume rockers are also right above it, so, all buttons are on the right.  In addition, this time, Samsung seems to have skipped the dedicated Bixby button, which, I think is a good decision actually.  Display   Upfront, the display seems to be the best part about this phone. It has a large  6” Super AMOLED Full HD+ display  with an  18.5:9 aspect ratio . There’s about  410 PPI pixel density , which makes for a sharp and crisp display. Colors are vibrant, and punchy and the pictures come out quite detailed. You can also view the contents pretty well even in bright sunlight. The touch sensitivity is also better than one found on midrange phones.  And Samsung is one of the very few smartphones to not include the notch on their displays. And due to this reason, even though the A7 2018 has a chin down below, I can live with it. But what I don’t like is that even with a bezel on top, there is no LED notification light. When you have a bezel up top, is it so hard to put a tiny notification light? Plus, the side bezels are also not as minimal as it could’ve been.   But besides that, I have no complaints. There’s also the Always On display option, that, when turned on, can make up for the absence of LED lights. But that will drain your battery, however. Other aspects of the display did impress me. And that’s why, I think that the display is the best thing about this phone.  Cameras   So, there are 3 cameras at the back, which is the major focus of this phone. The  triple camera setup  consists of a  24 MP primary lens with f/1.7 aperture , a  5 MP depth sensor  and an  8 MP ultra-wide sensor with f/2.4 aperture . With these three cameras, I expected quite a lot from this phone. But, I think, I had too high of expectations from this one. I was thoroughly impressed by the triple cameras on the Huawei P20 Pro and expected similar results, but it doesn’t nearly meet those standards. Of course, it is unfair of me to compare this mid-range with an expensive flagship, but Samsung is also known for great cameras.      Regular Camera Samples   1  of 17                                                                                                                                                                                            Image quality from the main camera is good, and really good in some good lighting conditions. There’s good contrast and colors seem accurate enough. Details are well preserved and there’s vibrancy in the images. However, the pictures didn’t impress me as much as I thought it would. In low light, it’s even worse. There’s noticeable loss in details, quite the amount of noise and images are jittery. But images in well-lit indoor conditions are good enough.      Low Light Samples   1  of 3                                                Samsung’s  Scene Optimizer  that makes colors pop in some scenarios makes its appearance here as well, but it doesn’t seem as good as on the Galaxy Note 9. The Portrait mode, which Samsung calls Live Focus, is again, typically Samsung. Edge detection on human subjects can produce good results most times. Whereas, on other objects, it’s a hit or a miss condition. When they do work, they can produce excellent results, but this is an aspect Samsung really needs to work on.      Regular vs Wide Angle   1  of 4               Regular         Wide Angle         Low Light         Low Light Wide Angle                        The Ultra Wide lens is the extra sensor on this phone. The new addition is definitely welcome, but the pictures from this camera, are again, not that great. Its 120-degree field of view helps you capture sceneries easily. An 8 MP resolution means you won’t be able to zoom in really well, but if you’re taking a wide angle shot, you won’t need to zoom, would you?\xa0Also, the f/2.4 aperture makes it more or less, unusable in low light, which is a downer. But hey, ultra wide images of natural landscapes do look great. Again, since ultra wide images are processed differently, there will be some color shifts in the pictures, but it won’t be anything to fret over about.      Selfie Camera samples   1  of 5               Regular selfie         Portrait selfie         Regular selfie         Regular selfie         Portrait selfie                           The selfie camera does a really good job. As usual, it is the same story, well lit conditions equals impressive shots, but low light images…not so much. Your facial details are well represented but the absence of backlit HDR causes blown out lights in sunny environments. Portrait selfies are purely software here, but to my surprise, it did a better job than the back camera. There’s also a Wide Selfie option that enables you to include more people in your selfies, which is a good touch.  For Hi-resolution camera samples,  click here .  As for videos, this phone is  not able to take 4K videos , but only  1080p videos @30fps . Videos  have EIS , but the Auto Focus is quite slow. It can be annoying, but having said that, the videos are better than some of the phones at this price range. There’s also Slo-Mo, and Samsung’s Slow-Mo are always good enough.  The triple cameras on the Samsung A7 2018 are not very impressive, but it certainly is interesting. After all, it’s not always that you get three cameras on a mid-range device.  Performance  We mostly criticize Samsung for their poor choice of processors on their mid-range smartphones. The J6, J8, and A6+ we recently reviewed all had an average chipset, but that’s not the case with the A7 2018. It is powered by  Exynos 7885 chipset  which offers powerful  Cortex A73 cores . Combined with its  4 GB RAM , the phone performs accordingly. Transitions are quite smooth, and multi-tasking is breezy. Regular web browsing and app usage work pretty well.  Light gaming works pretty well too. As for PUBG, you can play it good enough in Medium settings, but there will be slight stutters. But, the jitters stayed even in Low settings while I was playing it. Other games like Dead Trigger 2 work good enough. Thermals are pretty good, as even with a couple sessions of PUBG, the phone didn’t go over 38-degrees.  The phone runs on  Android 8.0 Oreo  with  Samsung Experience 9.0 . Now, Samsung phones get updates quite late, but the fact that it’s still running on Android 8.0 and not 8.1, or even Samsung Experience 9.0 and not 9.5 bothers me a little. Yes, that doesn’t make that much of a difference, but the latest is always better.      OS Screenshots   1  of 10               lockscren         homescreen         notification shade         app drawer         bloatware         finder         my files         settings         about device         gallery                                          Samsung’s UI also comes with quite the bloatware, and the very first one that comes to mind is Bixby. Yes, there’s no Bixby button, but if you swipe left on the home screen it’ll sneak up on you. There are some nifty additions like swiping down anywhere on the home screen to drag down the notification shade. And for someone with small hands, it’s a good quirk to have.  The  fingerprint sensor on the side  works well enough, but having one on the side has its own set of inconveniences. For example, if you are left-handed, then, you’ll probably have to think about which finger to unlock it with. Plus, a sensor on the side means the position of your finger has to be just right to unlock it. There’s also  Face Recognition , but as it is with Samsung devices, it’s not the fastest we’ll see.  Overall, the performance on this phone is just good, no more than that. If you’re into high end gaming, maybe you should pick something else, but it does a commendable job on other fronts.  Battery and Storage  As for storage, it comes in options of  128 GB with 6 GB RAM  and  64 GB with 4 GB RAM  options, but in Nepal, we only have the  4 GB variant available in Nepal . 64 GB option is quite enough, and there’s also a  dedicated microSD card slot  to expand your  memory up to 512 GB .  As for battery, the A7 2018 has a  3300 mAh battery . Now, that is like the standard battery capacity in 2018. And it is also enough to last you through the day in regular usage. Heavy users, however, will need to carry around a charger with them. Also, if you’re a heavy user, you would be better off turning off the Always on Display, but with the absence of those notification lights, you’ll be in a dilemma.  It’s sad to see Samsung still employing a microUSB port. And the  absence of Fast Charging  adds more to its woe. The phone will take well over two and half hours to fully charge.  Conclusion and Verdict  I feel like the Samsung Galaxy A7 2018 is an ambitious mid-ranger. The three cameras at the back is the major focus of this device, but the areas it has cut corners are clearly visible. Despite having 3 cameras, the image quality is nothing extra ordinary and it fails to keep par with Samsung’s flagship cameras even..   Also, it cuts corners in design with the thick bezels. Plus, the absence of LED lights despite having a bezel up top bothers me. Also, the older Android version and Samsung’s own UI is something to think about. Furthermore, lack of fast charging is also something you need to live with.  But Having said that, the price of the phone is around  $400 internationally  or  Rs.43000 in Nepal . When it comes to international and local pricing, Samsung does a commendable job. For this price, you are getting a AMOLED display, a good enough design, good enough set of cameras, and a full day battery life. Also, on the performance front, Samsung has added some improvements compared to its other predecessors.  If you’re looking for better cameras, there are options like Oppo F9, and Huawei Nova 3i is still the winner in terms of design. But this phone provides some unique quirks, and that additional camera is interesting. It’s not really a killer by any means, but is certainly a good buy…especially with the brand value that Samsung provides.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/a7-feature.jpg']

The P-series during Spring and the Mate series in the fall. As promised, Huawei has launched the Mate 20 & Mate 20 Pro in an event in London. Both these phones offer an upgrade over the  P20 Pro  with new Leica cameras, faster charging, and a 7-nm  Kirin 980 SoC .  Huawei Mate 20 Pro:  The Mate 20 pro offers a 6.39-inch curved OLED display with a\xa01440 x 3120 px resolution (539ppi).

If you don’t like the face unlock, you have the option to either choose the trendy in-display fingerprint sensor.         Under the hood, the Mate 20 Pro is powered by the latest Kirin 980 SoC. It’s the first 7nm SoC seen on an Android smartphone (yes, Apple did it first on its new  iPhones ). It has an Octa-Core processor in a tri-cluster combination: two powerful Cortex A76 cores @2.6GHz, two medium Cortex A76 cores @1.92GHz and four energy efficient Cortex A55 @1.8GHz. There’s Mali-G76 MP10 10 core GPU for graphics-intensive tasks. According to Huawei, the Kirin 980’s Cortex A76 cores offers a 75% boost in performance and 58% improved power efficiency over the A73 cores in the Kirin 970.

The secondary lens are a 20MP sensor with f/2.2 ultra-wide lens and an 8MP f/2.2 telephoto camera.

Following the same tagline, the Nubia Z17 lite has launched in Nepal. Originally launched back in September of 2017, the smartphone features somewhat of an outdated specifications for the present time.  Starting off with the display, there’s a 5.5″ FHD IPS LCD panel with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It comes with a 28nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 SoC inside, paired with Adreno 510 GPU, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of non-expandable storage. Powering the device is a 3200mAh non-removable battery.  On the camera side, it comes with a single 16MP f/2.0 sensor at the front. There resides a set of two 13MP cameras with dual tone flash capable of 4k video recordings at 30fps on the rear side. Nubia claims that it produces some good quality photos but we will have to see that for ourselves.        There is a rear mounted fingerprint sensor on the back. You also get a headphone jack with active noise cancellation and DTS sound support. On the software side, all you get is Android Nougat 7.1 with Nubia UI 5.0 on top.

Most recently with the  Samsung Galaxy J6 Plus , and now with the J4 Plus. Of course, Samsung’s mid-range phones are not that impressive. And similar is the story with the Galaxy J4 Plus, which just launched in Nepal.  The Samsung Galaxy J4 Plus has very fewer improvements over the J4. The “Plus” in the name only means a bigger display and a bigger battery. Everything else is, more or less, the same.  Overview         Samsung Galaxy J4 Plus features a  6.0″ IPS LCD HD+ display . Even with a bigger screen size, which Samsung calls the Infinity Display, the resolution stays the same, which doesn’t seem appropriate. Also, while the J4 had an AMOLED panel, the J4 Plus moves down to IPS LCD. And this is something that bothers me a little. The phone, however, is slightly slimmer in terms of design than the J4.

The device is making headlines for being the first ever smartphone that houses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset.  The Honor 8C is a budget-oriented smartphone that comes in a plastic body. It sports a tall 6.23-inch IPS LCD display with a notch on top. This display is of HD+ resolution and has a pixel density of 269 PPI. The major talking point here is definitely what’s inside. The Honor 8C is among the few smartphones from Huawei not to come with the company’s own Kirin chipset. It is powered by the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor. In terms of memory and storage, the device has 4 GB of RAM with 32 or 64 GB of internal memory.         The Honor 8C runs on Android v8.1 Oreo with EMUI 8.2 on top as a skin. In terms of camera, it is equipped with dual 13-megapixel and 2-megapixel rear-facing cameras with f/1.8 and f/2.4 aperture respectively. The secondary camera here has been used for applying depth effect. For capturing selfies, there is an 8-megapixel camera up front that has a f/2.0 aperture.  The Honor 8C has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner but lacks a gyro sensor. There is a large 4,000 mAh battery inside backing up the whole device. It, however, lacks fast charging technology.

['Samsung Galaxy A7 2018 now available for purchase in Nepal'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 12, 2018']",2018-10-12 10:36:18+00:00,"['When Huawei introduced triple camera setup on a smartphone in the  Huawei P20 Pro , it filled the smartphone world with awe. Even after several months of the launch of that phone, only a few brands embraced the concept of triple cameras. And the  Samsung Galaxy A7 2018  is among such few numbers of handsets. The smartphone was launched a while back in the international market. And in less than a month of time, the smartphone is available for purchase in Nepal.   Overview  The Galaxy A7 2018 comes in Black, blue, gold or pink colors. The phone inherits a glass both on the front and on the back and a metallic frame is sandwiched in between. Because of the glass back, A7 2018 is definitely appealing when it comes to looks. Since Samsung always provide a praise-worthy build to its smartphones, we can expect it to feel premium even on the hold and on the use.         On the display front, the A7 2018 comes with a tall 6-inch Super AMOLED display. The phone has narrow bezels on the top and on the bottom so Samsung likes to call it an infinity display. In terms of resolution, the phone features Full-HD+. So with the pixel density of 411PPI, the contents of the screen look absolutely sharp.   On the performance front, the phone comes with an octa-core processor with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage at its disposal. There is also a dedicated SD card slot to expand the storage further to 512GB.  The camera is the USP of the phone. And as mentioned earlier, the phone comes with three cameras on the back. There is a 24MP primary camera, which is said to excel even in the low light settings. Alongside the primary sensor, there is an 8MP sensor with a wide-angle lens and a 5MP depth sensor. The wide-angle lens can be used to expand the field of view while capturing the images where is the depth sensor comes into action while taking portrait images.   The phone packs all the primary sensors like accelerometer, gyro, proximity, and compass sensors. There is also a fingerprint sensor for the security, which is mounted on its power button. On the software front, the phone comes with Android Oreo (v8.0) with Experience UI on the top.  In terms of cost, the phone is tagged with the price of Rs. 42,990. And at the moment, the phone is available only for pre-booking. And the pre-bookers will be getting either a bottle speaker or a Level U Flex headphones for free. That’s not all, all the buyers of the phone will get six months breakage insurance from Shikhar Insurance. The inclusion of breakage insurance on the midrange handsets is very rare and this initiative from Samsung is really praise-worthy.

To cut down the price, we can see smartphone manufacturers cutting the corners on every aspect possible. But among such a crowd of smartphones,  Nokia 2.1 AKA Nokia 2 2018  stands there to inspire other smartphones with its massive battery. But what more features and specifications does the smartphone packs inside? Let’s have a look!  Nokia 2.1 (Nokia 2 2018) Overview  In terms of display, the Nokia 2.1 comes with a 5.5-inch display, which is quite unusual for a budget smartphone since the budget phone comes with smaller displays. So the presence of 5.5-inch display on this handset is really praise-worthy. The phone also comes with HD resolution packing 267PPI pixel density.  The phone comes with Snapdragon 425 chipset with 1GB RAM and 8GB of storage alongside. \xa0The storage can be further expanded to 128GB via SD card. And the phone has incorporated a dedicated SD card slot for that very purpose. On the software side of things, the Nokia 2 2018 comes with Android Go version of Android Oreo. So with Android Go OS at the disposal, the apps on the phone consume less amount of RAM and ROM and users won’t be getting the messages like “insufficient memory” so often.         Talking about the camera, the Nokia 2 2018 features an 8MP camera at the back. And on the front, the phone enjoys a 5MP Selfie shooter. In terms of regular connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS, the phone also comes with an FM Radio.  As I mentioned earlier, the phone with a battery of big capacity, of 4000mAh to be precise. Since the phone has a low power consuming chipset and light version of Android OS, the phone can easily provide back up for more than two days on the normal usage. So this smartphone can really be handy for the people who seek a big-time battery boost on a budget.

The launch comes after numerous leaks and rumors that had suggested about the Korean Giants’ plans to release a new smartphone with quadruple cameras.  The Samsung Galaxy A9 2018’s rear-facing four cameras are meant for a few different purposes – four in total. There is the primary 24-megapixel camera with f/1.7 aperture that is accompanied by a 5-megapixel lens with f/2.2 aperture meant solely for applying depth.         Likewise, there is a telephoto lens measuring 8-megapixel with f/2.4 aperture while the final lens is meant for capturing wide-angle shots with the 10-megapixel f/2.4 lens.  The Samsung Galaxy A9 2018 has followed the  Galaxy A7 2018  which features three cameras in total.  The camera setup on the Galaxy A9 2018 is something that we haven’t seen before. It has tried to cover up all the necessities while taking a picture with a single device.  The device has a tall 6.3-inch Full HD+  Super AMOLED display . It has an 18:9 aspect ratio screen that is clad by minimal bezels on the top and the bottom. It is powered by the popular the octa-core  Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor  that is coupled with 6 GB or 8 GB of RAM according to a user’s preference.   For selfies, the Samsung Galaxy A9 2018 has a 24-megapixel selfie shooter with f/2.0 aperture which we have already seen being used with the  Galaxy A8 Star  and the A7 2018. For storing all your selfies, this device features 128 GB of internal memory that is expandable up to 512 GB via a microSD card slot.  For lighting up the display and powering the CPU, Samsung has included a 3,800 mAh battery inside. There is a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner on the device above the Samsung emblem.

['Razer Phone 2 – The Perfect Gaming Phone?'],[],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['October 11, 2018']",2018-10-11 09:59:22+00:00,"['So with the rising popularity of games like PUBG and Fortnite on mobile, the rise of Gaming centric phones was inevitable. And so, gaming computer companies like ASUS and Razer stepped into this zone. The  Razer Phone  from last year, as many said, was a mixed bag. But this time around, the Razer phone 2 seems to fulfill all the shortcomings. And while it stands, is it the perfect gaming phone?  The Razer phone 2 comes with a very identical design to last years. It sports the same boxed design and thickness. But this time, it’s a glass back which is for the wireless charging, that the phone supports. And the glass back makes it look even more premium. Plus, it has  Gorilla Glass 5  protection and  IP67 Water Resistance . The fingerprint sensor rests on the power button, too. The identical design also means it has the same front-facing giant speakers that support Dolby Atmos sound. But even with the IP67 rating, the speakers keep up their great audio quality.  What’s more? The Razer logo at the back glows! That too, with customizable RGB chroma colors! You can change it to the way you want it, and the company claims that they even double as notification lights. How cool is that? For some, that may be a gimmick but it’s a gimmick I like.         This phone has a  5.7″ IGZO IPS LCD Quad-HD display  with  16:9 aspect ratio  and  1440 x 2560 resolution . The world may be moving to larger 18:9 aspect ratios, but Razer stands its ground. But it has the large speakers and no notch to speak for it. Plus, with its QHD display and  120 Hz refresh rate , the display is very smooth. That is more than enough for some of the best gaming experience. Also, the screen is now 50% brighter, which maxes out at  580 nits . In addition, the IGZO display type consumes less power while allowing smoother transitions.  The cameras on last year’s Razer Phone weren’t anything to mention. But the Razer Phone 2 has significantly improved the cameras. Its dual cameras consist of a  12 MP regular lens with OIS  and another  12 MP sensor with 2x Optical Zoom . The selfie camera is an  8 MP  shooter that is capable of taking Full HD videos at 30fps.  As for performance, being a gaming phone, it has all the flagship specs. It comes with the  Snapdragon 845 chipset , with the  Adreno 630 GPU . Combined with its  8 GB RAM , you can bet that it is a powerhouse. One that’s just right for all that heavy mobile gaming. Also, it has  64 GB internal storage  but also has a microSD slot which allows you to expand it up to 1 TB. Plus, this phone has a  Vapor Chamber cooling system  for better thermals. This should keep the phone relatively cool during your intense gaming sessions. Furthermore, a large  4000 mAh battery  should last you for quite some time for your gaming.  This phone runs the  stock Android 8.1  still. The Razer Phone 2 has no headphone jack, just like last year, but that’s the only off-putting factor I can see on this smartphone. But it comes with a USB-C dongle. Overall, this phone is built to be a powerhouse for gaming, but it also has all the necessary features for the average joe as well. And with a crisp 4K display, and those speakers, media consuming is also going to be a treat. What’s more? This phone  costs $800  only, and I say only because that’s less than most of today’s flagships!   Razer Phone 2 Specifications:   Design & Build : Aluminum Body with Glass Back, RGB illuminated Chroma lighting on the back, IP67 Water and Dust resistant  Display : 5.7″ IGZO IPS LCD QHD display (1440 x 2560) with 16:9 aspect ratio, Gorilla Glass 5 protected  Rear camera:  Dual cameras, 12 MP lens, f/1.8 aperture with PDAF and OIS + 12 MP 2X optical zoom lens, f/2.6 aperture  Front camera : 8 MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture  Processor : Octa-core Snapdragon 845  GPU : Adreno 630  RAM : 8 GB  Storage : 64 GB, expandable up to 1 TB with microSD card  Battery : 4000 mAh, Quick Charge 4.0+ enabled, supports Wireless charging  Connectivity : Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, WiFi direct, Hotspot  Price:\xa0 $800   What do you think about this gaming phone?

['Samsung Galaxy J6 Plus launched in Nepal with dual rear cameras'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 11, 2018']",2018-10-11 07:14:24+00:00,"['Lately, Samsung has been aggressively expanding its mid-range smartphones. And  Samsung Galaxy J6 Plus  is the recent addition. The phone comes with dual rear cameras at the back, which is the USP of the phone. But what more features are packed inside this handset? Let’s Find out!  Samsung Galaxy J6 Plus Overview  The Samsung Galaxy J6 Plus comes with a tall 6-inch display. The phone, however, comes with only HD+ resolution with 274PPI of pixel density. The display on the phone comes in an 18.5:9 aspect ratio with a generous amount of bezel on the forehead and the chin. However, this did not stop Samsung to call the screen on the Galaxy J6+ an infinity display. Also, most of the Samsung phones come with Super AMOLED panels used as display material. However, the J6+ comes with an IPS LCD panel. So the users won’t be getting vibrant colors on the J6+ like most of the typical Samsung phones.  As I mentioned earlier, the phone comes with a dual camera at the back, which genuinely implies the Samsung Galaxy J6+ to be a camera-centric smartphone. The phone embraces a 13MP primary sensor with a lens of f/1.9 aperture. This primary camera is accompanied by a 5MP camera for the depth sensing purpose. With both cameras in action, the phone is supposed to capture portrait images. On the front, there is an 8MP sensor which comes with a f/1.9 lens.         When we come to the performance department of the J6+, we can see the absolute mediocrity. The phone comes with Snapdragon 425 chipset backed by 3/4GB RAM and 32/64GB of storage. However, there is no SD card slot on the phone so the users won’t be able to expand the memory any further. Despite everything, the RAM and ROM configuration is acceptable at this price, however, the processor is not surely up to the par. The phone carries a Quad-core processor, which has a clock of mere 1.4 GHz. It is really pathetic to see the tech giants like Samsung providing such underpowered chipsets in its mid-range handsets.  Talking about the sensors, Samsung has always been frugal on providing even the necessary sensors on its midrange phones. But that tradition seems to have overturned in the Samsung Galaxy J6+. The phone comes with all the basic sensors like accelerometer, gyro, proximity, and compass sensors. There is also a fingerprint sensor on the phone for the security. However, unlike, most of the phone available in the market, the J6+ comes with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor on the phone resides on its power button.  On the software front, the phone boots on Android Oreo (v8.1) out of the box with Samsung’ Experience UI on the top. The phone also boasts a 3300mAh battery to fuel the device.

At this price, the answer is a\xa0clear no. The phone comes with a dual rear camera, which is a good thing. And since Samsung always provide cameras with great quality even on their midrange and budget handsets. And I am not doubting it on the Samsung Galaxy J6+. But since the phone lacks a decent chipset, a sharp Full-HD resolution or vibrant AMOLED display, and an SD card slot for memory expansion, this is not good to buy. Not at all!   At this price bracket, one can buy the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI  (4/64GB, price Rs. 26,499) instead of the 3/32GB variant of the J6+. And instead of the 4/64GB variant, one can opt for the  Xiaomi MI A2  (price Rs. 30,999), which offers better value for money.   But if one is a true Samsung fan and want to stick to the brand,  Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo  and  Samsung Galaxy J8 \xa0still are the better choices. If there is any list of the worst phones to buy in Nepal, Samsung Galaxy J6+ stands on the first of the list. So it is the best phone to skip at this price.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/samsung-galaxy-j6-plus.jpg']

['Google Pixel 3 and 3XL launched: Smartphones that just scream Google!'],"['Google', 'Google Pixel']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 10, 2018']",2018-10-10 01:22:38+00:00,"['Prior to the official announcement, we had already seen numerous leaks and rumors regarding the  Google Pixel 3 and 3XL . In the past couple of months, we also heard the news of Google Pixel 3/3XL being lost and found on various occasions. That’s not all, some bloggers made videos and published the Pixel 3/3XL reviews way ahead of time. So everyone already had a rough idea of almost all the hardware components on the phone. But when Google Tweeted a video called “So you think you know…” with all the clips of rumors, leaks, review regarding the Pixel 3 and 3XL, everyone was expecting a pleasant surprise in the event. But sadly, there were no big things on the phone, which we didn’t see in the earlier leaks and rumors. But if you were unaware of all that information, let me explain it to you all in detail.  Design  In terms of design, the new pixel looks almost the same as last year’s. It comes with a two-toned design, however, this time the whole material used on its back is glass. And between the glass front and glass back, a metallic frame is sandwiched in between. The glass panels used on both sides is the Gorilla Glass 5 from Corning. The new Pixel devices feature a circular fingerprint sensor at the back and nothing much has changed in there.  The phone also has an IP68 certification to withstand the effects of dust and water, which is quite an upgrade since the Pixel 2/2XL had IP67 certification. Making use of the glass design, the handset also comes with wireless charging feature, which was previously absent.        Display  The taller of the two or the XL variant of the phone comes with the 6.3-inch OLED display. The display on the phone features QHD+ (1440 x 2960 pixels) resolution in an 18.5:9 aspect ratio. With this resolution, the Google Pixel 3XL will boast a pixel density of 532PPI. So this newbie will be the sharpest Pixel device ever. \xa0The phone also comes with a large notch (one of the largest notches in a smartphone) and a generous bezel on the chin, which makes it really unappealing.  That ugly notch has been completely eliminated on the Pixel 3. Pixel 3 enjoys a 5.5-inch display without a notch on its top. At its new size, the Pixel 3 boasts 10% bigger screen over its predecessor maintaining the same size. In terms of resolution, the smaller one comes with Full-HD+ (1080 x 2160 pixels) with which the users can enjoy the contents with the same amount of sharpness like on its predecessor.  Despite the differences in display size and the resolution, both the new pixel devices share the same features. The screen on both the devices support HDR, Always On, and color modes. There is Boost mode on the handset, with which one can opt for punchier colors (sRGB + 10%). There is also the Always On display feature, which used to be found mostly on the Samsung phones. With this feature turned on, the screen always shows the song that’s currently being played on the phone.  Performance  Since it is a flagship phone, one could have easily guessed that the phone possesses  Snapdragon 845 chipset  inside of it. And everyone has this correct. However, the chipset’s has been underclocked to make the device more power efficient. The big cores are downclocked to 2.5GHz and the little ones to 1.6GHz to save battery power. Despite the downclock, it does not impact the performance significantly. Talking more about the performance, there is no amp up in RAM and storage when compared to the last year’s Pixel devices. We can still see 4GB of RAM and 64GB and 128GB variants on the storage side. And there is no SD card slot for the memory expansion.  Rear Camera  Camera has been the biggest thing on the Pixel devices since the beginning. Despite having a single camera on the back, last year’s pixel devices quite easily outperformed the popular smartphones with dual cameras. And this year too, Google seems to have similar thoughts in its mind. The new handsets come with 12.2MP optically stabilized image sensor with f/1.8 lens and 1.4µm pixel size, which has not changed from the past. So Google is depending entirely on the software and AI to get better pictures.  On the camera’s software side, the phone comes with HDR+ and Top Shot features. TOP Shot is an AI-based feature, which makes sure that everyone in the photo is in focus, smiling and has their eye open. This could surely be a handy feature since often images get ruined due to lack of focus and the people in the frame having their eyes closed. The phone selects the best picture from the several shots captured and makes things easy for the users. If one wishes to see all the captured images, they can easily be found in the Google Photos. There is also a Photobooth mode, which when turned on automatically captures images when the subject in the frame smiles or makes a goofy face.   Lossless zooming is one of the handy features in the smartphone cameras. Other smartphones use secondary telephoto lenses for that purpose. However, Google Pixel 3 and 3XL have just a single camera at the back. So lossless zooming is quite hard to obtain. To cope with that problem, the phone comes with a Super Res Zoom feature. This feature is basically another AI application, which tries to make up for the lack of telephoto lens by enhancing the details and quality of digital zoom.  Despite having an optically stabilized image sensor, it is hard to obtain smooth videos. For that very purpose, the phone comes with Fused Video Stabilization for stable and smooth videos while walking or jogging. It works for 4K videos at 30 fps but the best results are obtained when shooting at Full-HD and HD resolutions. But sadly, the phone still does not have 4k video recording option at 60fps.  With all the innovations and improvements in the smartphone cameras, low light images still tend to lose details and promoting a huge amount of noises and grains. So to improve the low light images, there will be a Night Sight feature, which is another AI-powered feature on the phone. However, this feature is not available at the moment and will be enabled on the phone after a software update.  Front Camera  On the front camera, we can see the big upgrade. Unlike the single camera on the back, we can see a pair of cameras on the front. Both the cameras feature an 8MP sensor. The camera setup on the phone features a normal lens and a wide-angle lens. The normal lens with f/1.8 aperture will have a 75-degree field of view. The field of view will be increased to 97-degree with the secondary lens (f/2.2) in action.   Audio  Both the new pixel devices come with the front firing stereo speakers. So the audio output from the phone will not only be loud, sharp, and clear but also will be safe from obstruction while playing games. The phone does produce some loud and crisp sound when the speaker in action, however, it lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired audio output. But no worries there since Google has included a pair of headphones in the retail box. And that’s not an ordinary one, the headphones included on the bundle is the Pixel USB-C earbuds, which has Google Assistant integration. With Google AI on the board, the new Pixel earbuds can handle voice commands, read out messages and can even do the real-time translations.  Battery  On the battery front, the Google Pixel 3XL comes with 3,430mAh battery, which is slightly smaller in capacity than its last year’s counterpart. The smaller one or the Pixel 3 features a 2,915mAh battery, which is a slight bump up in size when compared to the Pixel 2. But the biggest improvement here is on the charging side. The phones come with an 18W charger compared to a 10W charger in its previous generation. With a new fast charger in action, Google promises to provide a whopping 7 hours backup by plugging the device on charge just for 15 minutes.  And as mentioned earlier, these newbies also come with Wireless charging feature. But unlike the regular or the wired charging method, the charging speed is quite slower with the wireless charging. Namely known as the Pixel stand, the new wireless charger is rated 10 watts. This stand (wireless charger) allows the new pixel devices to work as a Google Home\xa0as a photo frame and even a sunrise alarm.  Price & Availability  With all the appealing features packed inside, the new pixels devices also demand a considerable amount of price on the purchase. In the US, the starting price of the phone is $800 for the Pixel 3, whereas the bigger one or the Pixel 3XL is slightly expensive at $900. In Europe, the Pixel 3 will cost the buyers a whole sum of €850 and €950 for the 64GB and 128GB variant respectively. Similarly, the prices of the Pixel 3XL are set to €950 and €1050 respectively for the 64GB and 128GB variants. In the UK, it’s ₤739/₤839 for the Pixel 3 and ₤869/₤969 for the Pixel 3XL.  Talking about the availability, the new phones will be available in the US starting from October 19 and in Europe, it’s November 2.

['Nokia 6.1 Plus review – Doesn’t feel like a Nokia anymore!'],"['Nokia', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['October 9, 2018']",2018-10-09 10:58:06+00:00,"['Nokia – the once household name in the phone industry made a comeback just a few years ago. And Nokia phones were all about durability. But the Nokia 6.1 Plus tries a different approach. The phone, although appearing premium, is not as durable. Now Nokia is a name trusted by many. But, does the Nokia 6.1 Plus bring enough to get a seat in the almost full table of smartphones?  Nokia 6.1 Plus Specifications   Design : Glass back and front in Aluminum Frame, Corning Gorilla Glass 3  Display : 5.8″ IPS LCD, Full HD+ resolution (2280 x 1080) pixels, 432 PPI pixel density  Rear Camera : Dual cameras, 16 MP primary lens with f/2.0 aperture & PDAF + 5 MP depth sensor, capable of 4K videos @30 fps  Front Camera : 16 MP lens with f/2.0 aperture  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 636  CPU : Octa-core 1.8 GHz Kyro 260  GPU : Adreno 509  Storage : 64 GB internal, expandable up to 400 GB via microSD (Hybrid SIM slot)  Battery : 3060 mAh  Price : Rs. 37,635    Design  As usual, first, let’s talk about the design. This phone has a  glass back  sandwiched in an aluminum frame. The glass body feels premium in the hands, with just the right weight. It also feels quite sturdy, but I think Nokia is swaying away from its origins.         Now Nokia phones are known for their build quality. Their phones are built to last. If you hold a  Nokia 7\xa0Plus  in your hands, you’ll know what I’m talking about. But the Nokia 6.1 Plus has glass, which isn’t as durable as metal, is it? Or even plastic for that matter.   However, in other aspects, the phone does well. Its small form factor makes it quite easy to hold. The phone has dual cameras at the back, which very slightly protrudes out, but it won’t be that much of a problem. There’s a fingerprint scanner underneath it with the Nokia logo. There’s also the Android One logo, mentioning that it runs on the stock Android platform.   The right has the volume buttons and the unlock button, while the SIM tray rests on the left. Good thing, you can still find a headphone jack on it. Also, another good thing is that it has a  USB-C port , and beside it, there’s a single speaker grill. The speaker quality is like any other mid-range phone – above average. But, the sounds don’t get distorted even in high volume levels, which is another good thing.  The glass back, like any other glass back, attracts quite a lot of finger smudges. It’s very slippery, so, if you’re one of those who use their phones while laying down, be careful not to let it slip. I’ve had quite a few instances of this one dropping on me. But with its small form factor, it is highly ergonomic and fits in your hands quite well. While others are making their phones larger, the Nokia 6.1 Plus brings something new to the menu.  Display   This phone has a  5.8” IPS LCD display  with a  Full HD+ resolution . The 5.8” screen might be small by today’s standards, but for a small form factor and an ergonomic design, this is a worthy sacrifice.  I don’t mind the small difference in screen size between this phone and the others. The display is protected by  Gorilla Glass 3  and has a small notch up top. The small notch houses a front camera, a speaker and a proximity sensor. There are  no LED notification lights , which is a bummer. LED lights are one of the most under-rated features in a smartphone. You only realize their importance when you don’t have them.   Also, there is a chin at the bottom with the Nokia logo on it. I don’t know why they did this, as the logo is at the back as well. If this wasn’t there, we probably could’ve gotten a slightly larger screen. But even so, the small screen makes for a better pixel density. With about  430 PPI of pixel density , the display is crisp and vibrant. The colors look pretty good, and it has good sunlight legibility as well. You can also hide the notch if it bothers you. But with the latest security update, the option to remove the notch isn’t there anymore. It might make an appearance, but they don’t seem to be going away anytime soon.  Cameras   In the camera department, the Nokia 6.1 Plus has a dual camera setup at the back and a single selfie camera. The rear camera setup consists of a  16 MP lens with f/2.0 aperture  and a  5 MP depth sensor . In terms of images, the camera is slightly above average. In daylight, or good lighting environments, the images will impress you. Colors come out punchy, and vibrant, and the details are well preserved. The HDR feature also does a pretty good job.      Nokia 6.1 Plus Camera Sample   1  of 13               cloudy weather shot         building         daylight shot         close up shot         overlay shot         low light shot         evening shot         subject focus         indoor bokeh         macro         AR effect         low light flash         night shot                                                   Low light images, on the other hand, are not pleasing. They gather a considerable amount of noise and lose details. Colors appear washed out, and it gives you the impression of a low-quality camera.      Nokia 6.1 Plus Selfie and Portrait   1  of 7               portait         selfie         bokeh selfie         group selfie         portrait group selfie         bokeh group selfie         beauty mode selfie                                 For high-res image samples of the Nokia 6.1 Plus,  click here .  The portrait mode on this camera, known as the  Live Bokeh , here, is just average as well. You can set the level of depth effect before you take the pictures, but the edge-detection is hit-or-miss. The subject in the images get good focus, but it suffers in the border areas, and sometimes, some aspects in the background get focus unintentionally while ignoring some parts of the subject. Bokeh mode, in low light, is a straight NO. But bokeh mode is not meant for low lighting conditions anyway.   As for selfies, it’s the same story. Under well-lit environments, it produces impressive results, while it struggles to gather details in low light. However, the software-based bokeh portrait in the front camera impressed me more than the rear ones. Edge detection seemed better in selfies than from the rear cameras. The screen flash also makes up for the absence of a front flash in selfies. The beauty mode does a good job in both front and back and does not overstep the facial features like in some Vivo or Oppo phones.  The phone is also capable of recording  4K videos at 30 fps . But with no image stabilization, the applicability of this feature seems pretty limited. Also, the video quality in normal mode is sub-par. There’s slow motion on it as well, but the quality of the Slow-Mo videos is aggressively average.  The  Dual Sight feature  also makes its appearance here as well. This means you can take pictures and record videos with the rear and the front cameras simultaneously. But if you ask me, I don’t see the point of this. What are you going to do with those pictures, anyway? If you have any ideas, please let us know too.  The camera interface is also not as simple as I’d like it to be. You have to really get inside the camera UI to access all the features. This may not be a big deal for some, but when you’re used to simpler camera interfaces, it is a bit off-putting. Overall, the performance of the camera mostly depends on the light, and with some good features, it places the camera on the above-average section of the shelf.  Performance  Under the hood, this phone is powered by a  Snapdragon 636 chipset . This chip falls under the mid-range section, and so, the phone performs accordingly. With  4 GB of RAM , browsing through everyday tasks is breezy enough. The transitions are smooth, but it will take some time to load heavy apps. It handles almost everything you throw at it – browsing the web, social media apps, light gaming, etc. Multi-tasking is also smooth enough to some extent. However, it cannot keep the apps open for a long time in the background.  As for gaming, the phone handles its own. Asphalt 9 ran quite smooth, without any stutters, or dropped frames, and in medium graphics settings. PUBG, too, is playable in low settings and low frame rates, but without any stutters or lags. The loading time is considerably long, but once you get through that, you won’t face any problems while playing.      Nokia 6.1 Plus Software & UI   1  of 8               Keyboard text input         Side Menu         Settings         Notification shade         Home screen         File Manager         File Manager         App Drawer                                    On top of it, the  Android One OS  is a bliss. Android One is Google’s platform for certain phones, with which you get a clean and fluid software, the genuine stock Android experience. Google’s own AI features and security features are embedded into it. Plus, there’s no bloatware and includes soft nifty features like an Ambient display that turns the screen on when you get notifications. Also, you can pick up the phone to see if you have any notifications. Now, this isn’t as convenient as LED notification lights but somewhat makes up for an absence of the LED lights.  The  fingerprint sensor at the back  is fast and reliable too. It is not as fast as some other phones, but half a second of difference is barely noticeable, is it? But you can’t say the same for its  facial recognition feature , which is purely software. We have seen software-based facial recognition in a lot of other phones too, and they do a much better job than on this. The facial recognition takes some time, even under favorable lighting conditions. And you have to swipe up to fully unlock the device once your face is recognized. But in its defense, this is Android’s Smart Lock feature, and not the phone’s Facial Recognition security feature itself.  The one thing that does seem like a problem is that the phone’s screen gets unresponsive at times. You can’t press certain buttons on the screen, and even when you do, nothing happens. This is particularly annoying when taking pictures, as it didn’t even click photos, no matter how hard I pressed.  I would’ve thought nothing of this if I hadn’t faced some losses in PUBG due to this very issue! But frankly, I don’t know it was a problem on my review unit only or all the models in general. If any of you have faced, or face similar issues, do let us know in the comments too.  Battery and Storage  This phone has a  64 GB internal storage , with a  microSD card slot  as well, which uses a dual SIM slot. But I don’t think you’ll need to expand the memory, as Google Photos gives you unlimited backup for all your photos and videos.  As for the battery, it has a  3060 mAh  unit, which is not as per the standards of 2018. However, given its small screen, the battery does last. It may be the stock Android optimization too, but the battery doesn’t disappoint. With a full charge, you can get through the day in normal usage. This phone also supports fast charging with  Quick-Charge 3.0 , but it does not come with a Quick Charger in the box. I find this to be very unusual and Apple-like, but it is what it is.  Conclusion and Verdict  To sum up, I’d call this a practical device. Its compact size and ergonomic design with a good screen size and aspect ratio set it apart from the large phones these days. The display is vibrant, and the battery lasts. On top, the Android One experience is very elegant and it promises timely software updates.   Cameras do need some improvement in a few areas. And it’d be great if they could optimize the camera UI in future software updates. Performance is good enough for a normal user. But, I, personally think Nokia going with a glass back is like moving away from its direction. A glass back phone is certainly not built-to-last, which was the main focus of Nokia.  Also, the most depressing thing about this phone is the price! It is supposed to be a budget phone internationally, costing some $250 in the US, and INR 16000 in India. With all that it packs and its price, it is a good buy for an Indian and international market. Now, that should have been able to put the phone under Rs.30000 in Nepal. It actually would have been worth it for that price. But no, the price is a whopping Rs.37635 here! And that, my friends, is enough for me to decide to not get this phone.  There are so many options in that price segment out there, and even if you want Android One, you can get the Mi A2 which is more powerful than this! The Nokia 6.1 Plus, is a good phone weighed down by its exorbitant pricing, in Nepal. So, unless the price goes down, I’d advise you to think twice before getting this phone. It’s that simple!  Pros:   Compact size and ergonomic design  Premium feel  Vibrant display  Android One Software  Good battery life   Cons:   No more built-to-last  No LED notification lights  Sub-par low light camera performance  Less value for money (in Nepal)']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/feature.jpg']

Huawei Nova 2 Lite   Huawei Nova 2i  was a great success in the Nepali market. Following that, even the  Nova 3i  was a huge hit.

It features a dual-camera setup in the rear, which consists of a  13 MP lens  with  f/2.2 aperture  and a  2 MP depth sensor . The selfie camera rests at  8 MP . It also has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The phone is powered by a  1.4 GHz MSM8937  chip. Also, it has  3 GB of RAM .

['Huawei Y9 2019 is now available for purchase in Nepal'],['Huawei'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 7, 2018']",2018-10-07 10:47:09+00:00,"['It was last Friday, Huawei Nepal announced to launch the  Huawei Y9 2019 along with three other phones in Nepal . Nobody expected it to be so fast but Huawei made it really quick and brought the handset just in two days after the announcement. The phone is supposed to be the successor of the  Huawei Y9 2018 , which was launched in April. In just six months of time, the Chinese smartphone maker brought a new and upgraded handset, which is really good. But it is quite strange that the phone comes with “2019” in its name. Does this mean that the phone is equipped with capable specs that make it a worthy purchase even in 2019? Let find out!   Huawei Y9 2019 Overview  The big change on the  Huawei Y9 2019  is its display size. Y9 2018 had a 5.93-inch IPS display, whereas the newbie boasts a tall 6.5-inch IPS display. With this display size, the Y9 2019 is on par with the  iPhone XS Max  in terms of size and a notch on the top adds a\xa0slight resemblance. The display on the phone features Full-HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels) on the resolution side and comes with 19.5:9 aspect ratio.        On the performance front, Y9 2019 comes with the HiSilicon Kirin 710 chipset which is a huge upgrade over the Kirin 659 chipset on its predecessor. The phone also comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage, which is another worthy upgrade. With new memory configuration, the newbie shall suffice the needs of most of the users quite easily. But in case of insufficiency, the user can always make use of the Micro SD card slot, which would allow the users to extend the memory up to 400GB.   On the software side, the Huawei Y9 2019 comes with the Android Oreo (v8.1) out of the box. Huawei has also sprinkled EMUI 8.2 on the top to spice the things inside the system in Huawei’s way. After a month Google will release the Android Pie (v9.0), however, Huawei has not mentioned anything about the software updates. So if the phone runs on Oreo even in 2019, that would probably be a huge shame.  The thing, which would excite the customers most in the Y9 2019, is probably its cameras. Just like the  Huawei Nova 2i ,  Nova 3i , and  Y9 2018 , the newbie comes with a quad camera setup. The phone embraces dual cameras on both the front and on the back end. The rear panel houses a 16MP + 2MP camera duo whereas the 13MP and 2MP reside meticulously in the notch on the front side. A depth sensor has been provided to the secondary camera on both the sides. The depth-sensor basically comes into action while capturing portrait shots in order to blur the backgrounds.  Talking about the sensors, the phone has got all the basic sensors like Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, and compass sensors. It also comes with 4000mAh battery to fuel the processes inside the phone.  Huawei Y9 2019 Specifications:   Dimensions:\xa0 162.4 x 77.1 x 8.1 mm;  Weight : 173g  Display:\xa0 6.5-inch IPS display, 82.8% screen-to-body ratio  Resolution:  Full-HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio, 396 PPI  OS & UI:\xa0 Android 8.1 (Oreo) with EMUI 8.2 on the top  Chipset:\xa0 Hisilicon Kirin 710  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU :\xa0Mali-G51 MP4  RAM:\xa0 4GB  Storage:\xa0 64GB; Expandable up to 400GB  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual camera      16 MP primary sensor with PDAF 2 MP depth sensor for blurring backgrounds      Front Camera:\xa0 Dual camera      13 MP primary sensor  2 MP depth sensor for blurring backgrounds    Sensors:\xa0 Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Connectivity:\xa0 Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 ac (2.4GHz / 5GHz), Bluetooth 5 LE, GPS + GLONASS,\xa0Micro USB 2.0, 3.5mm headphone jack  Battery:\xa0 4000mAh Non-removable battery supports 10W (5V/2A) charging  Colors:\xa0 Midnight Black, Blue Swarovski, Aurora Purple  Latest Price: Rs. 29,990  [Price Last Updated On: July 25, 2019]   Verdict  The Huawei Y9 2019 looks like a promising device. But given the price and specs, it is not worth the price in my personal view. We reviewed the Huawei Y9 2018, which also had quad-camera setup and the megapixel count was also the same. However, the phone failed to deliver what it promised as the captured images were not at all pleasing when compared to its competitors.   But things might have improved on the Y9 2019. Since the phone has a better processor, one can surely get a good performance while gaming and multitasking. With the good processor on the phone, image processing on this newbie might have been better and users can get better images than what we see from the Y9 2018. But since I don’t have my hands on with the phone, I won’t say more about the Y9 2019. What I want to say is even the phone has promising performance on all the departments (which happens in a rare case), the phone is still overpriced. When there is  Xiaomi MI A2   (Rs. 30,999) at a much lesser price, which roughly outperforms the Y9 2019 on almost all the aspects (except the battery), why would anyone still buy the Y9 2019?  If Huawei had brought the phone at a price less than Rs. 30,000, it would still make some sense. But at the price of Rs. 34,900, the handset does not convincing by any means. Do you feel the same or are you impressed with the Huawei Y9 2019? Please let us know in the comment section down below.  You might like: Huawei Nova 3i Full Review!

These are devices that are hitting the mid-range and budget segment in the Nepali market.  Huawei Y9 2019   The  Y9 2019  is an upgraded version of the  Y9 2018 , with one major upgrade, the chipset. This time, it’s the Kirin 710 that is being featured in this one. Similarly, the display is something that that has been\xa0made\xa0a bit taller, with the 2019\xa0version having\xa0a 6.5 inches display. Also, this time\xa0the device is available in two memory variants, 4-64 GB or\xa06-128 GB. Other things more\xa0or less are the same, the same 4000 mAh battery.

It’s got a 13+2 MP rear camera set up at the back and an 8 MP selfie shooter. Storage- wise, you get 3GB RAM in total and a 32 GB internal storage that can be extended up to\xa0256 GB. The internals is handled by Qualcomm’s MSM8937 processor, which is basically another name for  Snapdragon 430 chipset .

The device is powered by the MediaTek MT6737M processor. The Y5 Lite will hit the budget segment with 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of onboard storage. The Android Go Operating System is specially optimized for budget smartphones and induces better performance and has better data management and security benefits.  Huawei Nova 3i  Likewise, Huawei is also bringing to the Nepali market the White version of the Nova 3i. Previously, the company had launched the Black and Iris Purple colors but this time around, they have added Pearl White to their range of offerings.   Well, Huawei seems to be on fire this time around. With the Nova 3 and 3i, they surely had made a buzz some time ago and again, there seems to be a good focus on the budget segment as well.

The smartphone maker has included a fair number of smartphones in its midrange lineup in 2018.  Nokia X5 (Nokia 5.1 Plus) ,  Nokia X6 (Nokia 6.1 Plus) ,  Nokia 7 Plus ,  Nokia 6 2018  and  Nokia 3.1  can be taken for an instance. And this time, the company launched the new handset at an event in the US. Namely known as the Nokia 7.1, this new handset will go on sale on the US and UK markets as well.  The Chinese smartphone maker has been lately focusing on the Asian market for its sales. But this time, HMD Global stepped up and launched its product at an event in the US. With this step, it can be seen that, with Nokia 7.1, HMD Global also has plans to expand its territory to the US and UK as well. But will it be able to mark its presence in the crowded smartphone market? That depends on the specs and features of the handset. So let’s dive straight into the Nokia 7.1 features.  Nokia 7.1 Overview  In terms of display, the phone comes with the 5.84-inch IPS panel with a notch on the top. The display on the phone is said to come up with the “PureDisplay screen technology” and the Nokia 7.1 is inherently the first smartphone to have this feature. The display on the phone also supports HDR 10 and is capable of converting SDR contents to HDR in the real time. And on the resolution front, Nokia 7.1 is rich with Full-HD+ resolution in a 19:9 aspect ratio and packing 432 pixels in every inch.         The design is another aspect, where the phone looks impressive. The phone comes with glass on the front and on the back with an aluminum frame sandwiched in between. With such design language, the phone looks appealing and premium at the same time.  On the performance front, the smartphone comes with Snapdragon 636 chipset coupled with 3/4GB RAM and 32/64GB of storage. And in terms of camera, the Nokia 7.1 features a dual camera with Zeiss optics at the back. The dual camera on the rear panel is the combination of 12MP and 5MP sensors. The primary 12MP sensor is the major player while capturing the images whereas the secondary camera or the depth-sensing camera back the primary one while capturing the portrait images. On the front, there is an 8MP camera for the selfies. Nokia 7.1 also possesses “bothie” feature in its camera with which the phone will be capable of capturing images from both the front and back cameras in a single frame.  Like all the new Nokia phones, the 7.1 is also the product of the Android One program. So this handset also comes with the stock version of Android. The phone initially runs on Android Oreo (v8.1) out of the box and it is promised with the Android Pie (v9.0) update in November. The phone will also receive other regular updates for two years and security patches for three years.  Fueling the processes inside the phone is a 3060mAh battery. The battery on the phone also supports fast charging feature with which the phone gets charged from 0 to 50% just in 30 minutes.   The Nokia 7.1 will come in two colors: “gloss midnight blue” and “gloss steel.” The phone will be available in a 32GB variant in the UK for €319 and the 64GB will demand a price of €349. However, the US will only receive the 64GB variant, which will demand a price of $349.

['Samsung Galaxy A8 Star Review: Does the Star shine bright enough?'],"['Android', 'Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['October 4, 2018']",2018-10-04 14:56:49+00:00,"['The A-series has always been a gateway from mid-range devices to the flagship smartphones in Samsung smartphones. They pack in some of the features from the mid-rangers while some they share with the flagships. This has been the case for a while now with Samsung’s long line-up of smartphones of the A-series, and that is continued with this device here. This is the  Galaxy A8 Star  which is Samsung’s answer to the growing number of cheaper high-end Chinese phones. So, is this device a star of the smartphone galaxy? Well, let’s find out.  Samsung Galaxy A8 Star Specifications   Display : 6.3-inch Super AMOLED display  Resolution : 1080 x 2220 pixels @ 392 PPI pixel density & 18.5:9 ratio  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 660  CPU : Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Kryo 260 & 4×1.8 GHz Kryo 260)  GPU : Adreno 512  OS : Android 8.0 (Oreo) with Samsung Experience 9.0 UI on the top  RAM : 6GB  Storage : 64 GB (expandable up to 400 GB, Uses SIM 2 slot)  Rear Camera : Dual- (24 MP, f/1.7, CAF) + (16 MP, f/1.7, PDAF), LED flash  Front Camera : 24 MP, f/2.0 aperture  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:\xa0 Dual Hybrid SIM with 4G  Battery : Non-removable Li-Ion 3700 mAh battery, supports fast charging (9V, 1.67A)  Price: \xa059,990    Display  The Samsung Galaxy A8 Star follows the trend of Samsung’s display being top-notch, even though there is no notch here. The front has a tall 6.3-inch full HD+ display with shredded top and bottom bezels just like the  Galaxy A8+ .         I like everything about this display, it is bright outdoors and with the Super AMOLED panel, it is well saturated, pleasing to the eyes and colorful. It certainly gives other smartphones a run for their money. If you compare it against the  OnePlus 6 , which is available in a similar price tag in some countries, they look quite similar to the eye. However, the bezels could have been a little shorter to make the phone look even more attractive.  Design   The Samsung Galaxy A8 Star has followed the trend of smartphones sporting minimal bezels and a glass back. This device is an addition to the popular A8 series. What we get with it is a boxy design that has sharp edges all around. These sharp edges make the phone a little bit difficult to use. I know some of you might like this, but at a time when most of the smartphones are focused on better looks and on-hands feel, Samsung has gone old school. But still, the device has a heft to it and feels premium. The shiny glass back looks quite good don’t you think? But yes, like every other smartphone of the present time, it attracts fingerprints, so I carried around a microfiber cloth at all times.   Sandwiched between the two glasses is a metallic rail that helps with better gripping. On this rail rest a few buttons. There is a power button on the right with the volume rockers and the infamous Bixby button on the left.  For me, the worst feature of this device is definitely the placement of these buttons. Just look at it. I don’t understand why Samsung has cut corners in the user experience. The buttons are hard to reach and whenever I thought I had pressed the volume button, it turned out to be the Bixby button and trust me it gets quite annoying when it happens quite a lot of time during the day.  Battery   The other area where the Samsung Galaxy A8 Star didn’t live up to my expectation is on the battery front. With the 3700 mAh battery at its helm, I had expected it to last for more than a day. However, that was not the case as it gave me a screen-on-time of around 5 hours – 5 hours and a half. Now running for all that time is good, but for that size and for what its worth, maybe it’s not good enough. Also, this device still has full HD+ resolution, so it should be working for a long time right? There is a fast charging tech embedded inside though with the default charger which is Type-C enabled, so that’s good!  Security   The Samsung Galaxy A8 Star, like every other smartphone of 2018, comes with dual security options – a fingerprint sensor and face unlock. The fingerprint sensor gets unlocking right every time and is a little faster than some of the Samsung devices. The face unlock, on the other hand, takes just a second to unlock the device, so you have that.  However, the disappointment here is the placement of the fingerprint sensor. Samsung and fingerprint sensors! Something that never goes together. I had praised Samsung for improving the fingerprint position on this year’s devices the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 9, but yet again Samsung has fallen short of making the fingerprint easy to reach. And when you have to constantly use your phone every now and then, well, it definitely gets annoying.  Performance and Software  On to the performance, the Samsung Galaxy A8 Star features the Snapdragon 660 chipset with 6 GB of RAM. I had no issues what so ever with the CPU of the device. It performs all your basic task flawlessly and lags are already the things of the past in Samsung smartphones. It has been able to handle my day-to-day usage efficiently as well. However, you can only play pubg in medium settings, which is kind of a bummer since we can play it in high settings in the similar priced OnePlus 6.   Samsung Galaxy A8 Star vs OnePlus 6 Antutu score  Infogram  \xa0  \xa0   Infogram  So, the talking point here is definitely the price. The A8 Star is surely expensive and compared against the OnePlus 6, the latter certainly outperforms the former with its Snapdragon 845 chipset. Yes, you get a flawless processor with the A8 Star with 6 GB of RAM, but if you’re paying a high price for it, you should definitely get the best. It should at least be equipping the Snapdragon 710 since even the cheaper Mi 8 SE has the same chipset. And if you talk about RAM & ROM, it doesn’t feature DDR4X RAM or UFS storage, so, does the pricing justify everything?  One the software front, the device comes with Android 8.0 Oreo with Samsung’s Experience UI 9.0 on top. The software is fluent and everything, and it is free of any sort of stutters if you are wondering. And if you are curious about when Android pie will arrive on the A8 Star, well we don’t know that yet.      Samsung A8 Star | Software UI   1  of 5                                                                    Camera   The Samsung Galaxy A8 Star follows the dual camera bandwagon by equipping a dual 16- and 24-megapixel cameras, both with f/1.7 aperture. The pictures come out great, and they are well detailed and sharp.      Samsung A8 Star Back Camera Samples    1  of 6                                                                              They are saturated as well but if you compare it against some of the other devices of its price range, you will see where it shines and where it falls behind.   The best part of the images I shot is certainly the details captured. The OnePlus 6 loses a lot of details when you zoom in.   However, if you see the golden colored plates on the images (below), you will notice how artificial it looks. And even though Samsung’s phones shoot oversaturated images, the OnePlus 6 certainly outperforms it with the saturation and colors front.   Also, the OnePlus 6 retains a high dynamic range whereas the Samsung Galaxy A8 Star falls only a little behind in that aspect.   There is also the Live focus mode on the phone which lets you toggle the intensity of the blur. The fake blur is indeed good, but if you zoom in you can easily notice the areas around the head where it hasn’t been able to blur out properly. Compare it against the OnePlus 6 and you will notice the 6 doing it better right away.   The rear cameras on this device are capable of shooting FHD and 4K videos at 30fps. Now I tried full HD videos on this device, and even without stabilization engraved, it takes stable videos with good colors and zoom capabilities. And yeah, it shoots slow-motion videos as well, but the quality is just about average.  During night time is where things get interesting. Although the pictures are noisy and slightly grainy, they are well saturated and retain the colors quite nicely if you ask me. If you zoom in the pictures, you will notice the loss in quality, but for what it’s worth, it definitely takes some decent pictures.

Samsung has definitely taken this step to vie against the phones from Oppo and Vivo among others. Take a look at some of the samples here. All of these images have good details and they have captured a natural skin tone. You also can apply a lot of stickers on your selfies if you want to. There is also a night mode for selfies, but I didn’t see any major difference here. So, all in all, Samsung has finally felt the necessity of focusing on selfies as well.      Samsung A8 Star Front Camera Samples   1  of 3                                                To check out all the images in high resolution,  click here .\xa0  Call Quality, Speakers, and Storage    In terms of call quality, I had no issues with this phone. The callers on the other end never complained about the call and the earpiece gives off a pretty loud sound.  The A8 Star has packed in a bottom firing speaker. This speaker is alright to fill up a small room. It is nowhere close to the dual stereo speakers of the  Galaxy Note 9  or the  Galaxy S9  though. And if you play pubg or watch a lot of videos, you will have to be extra careful not to block it.  Storage wise, the Galaxy A8 Star has 64 GB of storage with up to 400 GB of expandable storage.  Conclusion  To conclude, the Samsung Galaxy A8 Star is a good device with a crisp display, a well-performing CPU and a good set of cameras both front and back, and it packs in almost everything you want in a smartphone. However, it all comes down to the pricing. A lot of smartphones from the companies like OnePlus, Huawei and Xiaomi are giving a tough competition to Samsung if the price point is considered. While the flagship smartphones may be worth a fortune due to the features they have, the price tag of the Galaxy A8 Star is a little expensive. The mid-range smartphone battle is getting tougher day by day and Samsung should focus on price if it wants to stay up in the game.      Pros  Cons    – Great Display  – Pricey    – Good Cameras  – Battery life could have been better    –\xa0Top Quality Build  – Still no signs of Android 9.0 Pie']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/samsung-galaxy-A8-star-review.jpg']
['LG V40 ThinQ launched with whopping five cameras'],['LG'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 4, 2018']",2018-10-04 12:00:33+00:00,"['A set of three cameras on a side of a phone is still a huge thing in the smartphone world.  Huawei P20 Pro  and  Samsung Galaxy A7 2018  are one of the popular handsets that come with three cameras at the back. Before the concept of triple turns a mainstream feature in a smartphone, LG took the concept seriously and brought a new smartphone, namely known as the LG V40 ThinQ. That’s not all, LG also tried to hit hard on the part where Samsung and Huawei missed. Alongside the setup including three cameras at the back, LG has also provided dual selfie camera on the front. This makes a total of five cameras altogether and LG V40 ThinQ is the first smartphone to achieve this head-turning feature. But what more features does the LG V40 ThinQ pack inside? Let’s find out.   Design and Build  LG V40 ThinQ comes in four color options: Aurora Black, Moroccan Blue, Platinum Gray, and Carmine Red and all of them looks equally appealing. The handset looks sleek and is really thin with a mere thickness of 7.6mm. The phone has got a Military-grade build and features IP68 certification to withstand the adverse effects of dust and water on the inside.         Display  On the display front, the smartphone comes with a 6.4-inch P-OLED display. With this size, the smartphone looks comparable to the  Samsung Galaxy Note 9  and the  iPhone XS Max . In its already vibrant OLED display, the smartphone features Quad-HD+ resolution in a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. This contributes to the pixel density of 537PPI. So the contents on the display will look really sharp.  The phone also has a notch on the top to accommodate the dual selfie camera, earpiece, and various sensors. However, unlike the iPhones, the notch is narrow on the size.  Performance  Since it is a flagship phone, it also features  Snapdragon 845 chipset  like all the flagship Android smartphones of 2018. There is also a 6GB LPDDR4X RAM and 64GB of UFS 2.1 storage alongside. So with this setup, we can expect a top-tier performance from the phone. The phone has also allocated a dedicated SD card slot if the provided internal storage turns out insufficient.  Camera  As mentioned earlier, the phone has five cameras in total. So the camera is the unique selling point of the phone. LG V40 ThinQ embraces a triple camera setup at the back aligned in a horizontal configuration. Among the three, the normal or the standard one comes with 12MP resolution, f/1.5 aperture, 3-axis OIS, PDAF & Laser autofocus. The second camera with a 16MP resolution features ultrawide lens, which increases the field of view to 107-degrees. The third one or the telephoto camera comes with a 12MP resolution, f/2.4 aperture and features OIS for the stabilization. The telephoto lens on the phone is also capable of capturing images with the lossless zooming up to 2x.   A new Triple Preview feature is also available on the LG V40 ThinQ. With this feature, the users will be able to take three simultaneous shots from the three rear cameras at once. After taking the shots, users can pick the best among them according to their preference. The rear camera setup also comes with Dual Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF), HDR, and an updated AI Cam mode. The third-gen AI Cam mode recognizes up to 19 subjects and recommends 4 optimized filter options.  Similarly, on the front, there are two cameras residing meticulously in the notch. The camera pair on the front is the combination of 8MP and 5MP sensors. Among the two, the 8MP camera is the normal or standard one with an 80-degree field of view. Users can make use of the secondary 5MP camera if want to take ultra-wide selfies. Triggering the ultra-wide selfie mode, users can obtain a 90-degree field of view. That’s not all, the dual camera on the front is also capable of capturing portrait selfies with blurred backgrounds.  Audio  Audio is another aspect, where the LG V40 ThinQ shines. The smartphone comes with an improved Boombox speaker, 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad-DAC audio, and DTS:X 3D surround sound to fill the users’ mood with loud and immersive audio.  Battery  LG V40 ThinQ seems to have nailed it on almost every aspect but it seems lacking in the battery department. The phone is equipped with a non-removable battery, which only has a 3300mAh capacity. However, it supports Quick Charge 3.0 for fast replenishment of the battery. With Quick Charge 3.0, the phone gets refilled from 0 to 50% in just 36 minutes. There is also wireless charging feature for those, who think plugging the smartphone to the wall charger too mainstream.   LG V40 ThinQ Price, Release date  The starting price of the LG V40 ThinQ is $899.99 (roughly equal to NPR 104,500 and INR 66,100) in the US. But since it depends on the mobile carrier, it can go as high as $1000. Aurora Black, Moroccan Blue variants of the phone has already been announced in the US and will go on sale starting from October 18.

"['Microsoft Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2, Surface Studio 2, Surface Headphones Launched']",['Microsoft'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 3, 2018']",2018-10-03 09:11:43+00:00,"['At a recent event in New York, Microsoft unveiled its new and refreshed lineup of Surface devices. In the event, the tech giant not only showed off its upgraded laptop lineup but also announced a new product. The new product to be launched in the event was the headphones, which is dubbed as the Surface headphones. The new announcement of such wide varieties of products is really commendable. But are these devices really interesting in terms of features? Let find out.  Microsoft Surface Pro 6  After one and half years, Microsoft finally unveiled its upgraded  Microsoft Surface Pro  laptop/tablet hybrid in the event. In the new Microsoft Surface Pro 6, the company has included the 8 th  generation processor and a new black color variant.  Wrapped in Black, Blue, Red and Platinum Grey colors, the aesthetics of the Surface Pro 6 is really appealing. But despite the refreshment in the internals, the design of the device hasn’t changed much. It comes with the same ubiquitous hinge, keeping the Surface Pen close by and incorporating the same aspect ratio of 3:2. In its 12.3-inch display size, the 2-in-1 convertible features 2736 x 1824 pixels resolution contributing to a pixel density of 267PPI. The display on this new device will also have a higher contrast ratio than its predecessor. So, the content on this newbie will possess deeper blacks and brighter whites.         On the camera front, the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 comes with an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front facing camera, which can be used for Windows Hello and video calls. On the performance side of things, this new device comes with the updated 8 th  generation Intel core CPUs and with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB SSD alongside. With this configuration, Microsoft boasted a 67% boost in performance on this newbie when compared side by side with its predecessor.  In terms of ports, the device has accommodated one USB port, a micro SD card slot, a headphone jack, and a port for Microsoft’s proprietary surface connect charging cables. But there is no USB Type-C port.  The best thing of the Microsoft Surface pro convertible is its portability and the ease in getting the work done anywhere. And this portability has remain intact in this new device as well. The device is really light in terms of weight weighing just 1.7 pounds. Despite is miniature stature and light weight, it is capable of providing 13.5 hours of backup.  In terms of RAM, ROM, and processor configuration, the device comes in three variants. The base variant comes with a core i5 processor, 128GB SSD, and 8GB RAM, which is tagged with the price of $899. Similarly, the higher variant (i7/16GB/512GB) has a price tag of $1899 and the highest end variant (i7/16GB/1TB) will cost $2299 on the purchase. The pre-orders for the devices have already started in various countries. These devices will go on sale from 16 th  of October.  Microsoft Surface Laptop 2  Alike the Surface Pro 6 convertible, the Surface laptop 2 comes with the new Matte color variant, Whiskey Lake processor and an improved performance over its  predecessor .  Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 has a slightly bigger display than the Surface Pro 6. The device features 13.5-inch PixelSense display and comes with a resolution of 2,256 x 1,504 pixels. The device covers 100% of the sRGB color spectrum in terms of color accuracy. The surface laptop 2 rocks with 1500:1 in terms of contrast ratio, which is really appreciable. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 is also the first laptop to feature the thinnest LCD panels in any laptop.   On the performance front, the Surface Laptop 2 comes with the 8 th  generation Intel Core CPU with which the company claims a performance enhancement of 85% over its predecessor. That’s not all, this device also excels at reducing the noises from the fans and keyboard. For the input-output interface, ports on the device are still limited to a single USB 3.0 and Mini DisplayPort. It means the users have to live without the USB-C.  In terms of price and cost, the laptop 2 demands $799 (£649, AU$1,099) for the variant with the 7th-gen Intel Core m3 processor. The laptops with 8th-generation cost $999 (£979, AU$1,499) for (Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD) and $2,699 (£2,529, AU$3,750) for (Core i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) respectively. And just like the Microsoft Surface Pro 6, this device is available for pre-order as of now and will go on sale from 16 th  of October.  Microsoft Surface Studio 2  The new Surface Studio 2 is the fastest Surface Studio Microsoft has ever made. However, the overall aesthetics and the design language has barely changed when compared to its  predecessor .  The Surface Studio 2 comes with the 28-inch display with a resolution of 4500 x 3000 pixels. The size and resolution are same as its predecessor. However, Microsoft did an extra job to make the display on this newbie better than the processor. The brightness on its display has been increased by 38% and contrast ratio has been enhanced by 22%. This has been possible because of the improvements in the transistor technology which lies behind the display.   The original or the previous generation of the Surface Studio had a 6 th -gen Intel core processor with 32GB RAM, 2TB HDD, and 128GB of SSD. And this time, there are more modern and improved components on this new device. Although the 8 th -generation CPU, which most of us like to hear is basically absent, the device has incorporated 7 th -gen Intel HQ-series CPU. This is surely disappointing but still, it offers a decent performance boost over its predecessor.  Even on the graphics side, RTX card is absent here. The company opted for Nvidia Pascal GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 graphics. Despite another disappointment here, the bump in graphics performance over its predecessor might console the users a little bit. In terms of storage, Microsoft cut down the HDD completely and provided up to whopping 2TB of SSD onboard. This could be a great advantage for the users as the read/write speed of the SSD happens to be way higher than the mechanical hard drives.  In terms of pricing, the base variant with Intel Core i7-7820HQ processor, 16GB RAM, GTX 1060 graphics card, and a 1TB SSD costs $3,499 (AU$5,499, about £2,680).  Microsoft Surface Headphones  In the event, Microsoft not just launched the computing devices but also brought the noise canceling headphones, which goes by name Microsoft Surface headphones.  The new surface headphone is an  over-ear headphone , which features a premium sound and adjustable noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation, users can completely cut off the outside noises and can hear the audio in an immersive way. To change the level of noise cancellation, users will have to turn the dial on the left ear cup. And to adjust the volume, there is a dial on the right side, which needs to be turned in a similar way.   The headphone also supports “Hey Cortana” command, which with the headphone pauses the music when removed from the ears. The headphone charges via USB Type-C port. There is also a 3.5mm headphone jack port, which can be used for wired audio output. By the way, the 3.5mm cable is detachable, so users don’t have to cling with it while listening to music through the wireless means.  “They slip comfortably over your ears to surround you with spectacular sound quality and 13 levels of ambient noise control,” Microsoft’s press release says. “Designed with collaboration in mind, there are 2 beam-forming microphones on each ear cup, 8 microphones in total, all helping you focus on the sounds you want to capture allowing for excellent call experiences.”  For the controls, Microsoft has also included touch buttons on the ear cups to play/pause the audio or skipping tracks. Battery life is rated at 15 hours over Bluetooth or 50 hours when plugged in via headphone jack, and the sound can be customized via an app that Microsoft will release alongside the Surface Headphones.  Talking about the price, the Microsoft surface headphones will cost you $349 on the purchase.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/microsoft-surface-pro-6-laptop-2-studio-2-headphones.jpg']
['Huawei Y9 2019 with Kirin 710 is official'],['Huawei'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['October 2, 2018']",2018-10-02 11:26:11+00:00,"['Huawei Y9 2019, which had very recently surfaced with leaked rumors and specs, is now official! The  Huawei Y9 2018  was a well received product in the mid-range section. And we can expect the same from the 2019 version of the phone. The new Y9 sports more or less the same specs with some upgrades.  Huawei’s  quad-camera setup  also makes it way here. The rear camera setup is a combination of  16 MP with PDAF  and a  2 MP depth sensor . Also, the front camera features a  13 MP sensor  with a  2 MP depth sensor . And both these camera setups feature Huawei’s AI photography technology. By the looks of it, it seems like Huawei is really focusing on getting good portrait images. But, with 2 MP depth sensors, how much of it will be possible? We will see that in time.         Moving along, the Huawei Y9 2019 features a large  6.5″ Full View Display  with 3D curved design. The display is a  Full HD+  one, with  1080 x 2340 resolution . This phone, too, sports the infamous notch, but knowing Huawei, the notch is a bit smaller than other devices. These models will also come in two-toned color variants.  Under the hood, an  Octa-core Kirin 710 SoC  powers the phone. The company claims integration of  AI Power 7.0  in the chipset to bring better user experience. Again, how will that fare in real life, we’re eagerly waiting to find out. This phone comes in two variants. The base model has a  4 GB RAM , with  64 GB of storage , while another variant has  6 GB RAM  and  128 GB storage . However, both the phones feature a microSD card slot which can expand the memory up to 400 GB.  It also has a large battery of  4000 mAh , and will run on  Android 8.2 Oreo , with  EMUI 8.2  on top. Another interesting feature about this phone is its  Fingerprint 4.0  technology. The company claims that it has fingerprint navigation, which helps users manage all notifications with one key.  Huawei’s Y-series phones are always a value for money. And this can also have good pricing. The phone will hit the market by mid-October. Now, that maybe a bit early for something with 2019 in its name. But with so many smartphone companies pumping out phones, I guess Huawei doesn’t want to be left out. However, there is no word on its pricing yet.   Huawei Y9 2019 Specifications:   Display : 6.5-inch IPS LCD display  Resolution : Full-HD+ (1080 x 2340 pixels), 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Processor : Octa-core Kirin HiSilicon 710  RAM : 4 / 6GB  Internal Storage : 64 / 128GB  Operating System : Android Oreo 8.1 with EMUI 8.2 on top  Rear camera : 16 MP + 2MP  Front camera : 13 MP + 2MP  Battery : 4000 mAh']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/huawei-y9-2019-official.jpg']
['ASUS Zenbook UX430U Review – Good things come in Small Packages'],"['Asus', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['October 2, 2018']",2018-10-02 08:25:38+00:00,"['In the ultra-portable laptops department, it has always been Apple and its MacBooks that have taken the cake. But, they do cost quite a fortune. However, the ASUS Zenbook UX430U proves that such laptops don’t have to cost you a kidney! Now, this laptop does cost some $1100 or Rs. 1 lakh 30 thousand in Nepal, but it is somewhat equivalent to the  Dell XPS 13  or the Macbook Pro 13”, while its price is considerably less than them. But how does this fare in real life? Find out in this ASUS Zenbook UX430U Review.   ASUS Zenbook UX430U Specifications:   Design and Build:  All-metal body, 13″ form factor, 1.3 kg  Display:  14″ Full HD (1920 x 1080), 100% SRGB & 71% Adobe RGB, 290 nits peak brightness with Anti-Glare  Keyboard:\xa0 3-step back-light (white), 1.4 mm Key travel  Processor: \xa0Quad-core 8 th  gen i7-8550U processor, Base-Clock @ 1.88 GHz, Boost Clock up to 4 GHz  RAM:  16 GB (2 x 8 GB, not upgradeable)  Graphics:  2 GB NVidia GeForce MX150  Battery:  50 Watt-hour (up to 7 hours of backup)  Storage:  512 GB SSD  Connectivity: \xa02 x 2 dual band 802.11 ac Wi-Fi  Ports:\xa0 SD-card reader , \xa0USB 2.0,\xa0USB 3.1, micro HDMI, Audio port, USB-C 3.1 (no thunderbolt)  Price:  Rs.130,000 ($1100 international)  Colors:\xa0 Royal Blue, Rose Gold, Quartz Gray, Shimmer Gold    BUY HERE  Design and Build         In terms of design, this is one sleek laptop! It is small and compact, and quite thin. In terms of thickness, it is just as thin as the Dell XPS 13 and the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Also, at  just 1.3 kg , it is really light. It is one of the thinnest laptops I’ve used, and personally, I think all notebooks should have a similar build. Given that it is an ultra-portable notebook, you won’t have any problems carrying it around, be it in your backpack, or even a messenger bag for that matter.   The UX430U looks very good from the outside. With an  all metal build  that makes for that cool shiny appearance, it also has a sturdy build. You do get a bit flex when you press on top of the keyboard, but I find that amount acceptable.Overall, it looks pretty durable, and, I’m confident that even if it falls, nothing serious is going to happen, except for some small dents here and there.   The back of the laptop body seems well constructed too. The back also houses the speakers on either side which are  1.5 W Harmon Kardon certified speakers . These speakers give a rich sound output, but having the speakers at the back does affect the sound a little bit. Maybe they could have positioned the speaker somewhere else, but this is not really a big deal.  The aesthetics of the laptop is quite appealing too. On top of the shiny brushed metal texture, you get some faint rings around the silver ASUS logo in the center. This may not be anything unique, but it does give off a pretty premium look and feel while setting it apart from the likes of Dell XPS 13 or the 13-inch MacBook Pro.  Keyboard and Trackpad   The keyboard and trackpad on this laptop are fantastic! The keyboard was fun to type on with a good amount of feedback. The  1.4 mm of keyboard travel  is decent, as we can’t expect more than that on a laptop this size. The arrow keys, however, are smaller than other keys, in fact, smaller than I’d like and be comfortable with. So, that’s something you’ll have to get used to.   The trackpad is also really nice, with a good feel. Scrolling and other tasks are smooth enough.It’s definitely better than the plastic ones, but this isn’t one of the best trackpads around. Again, the Dell XPS 13 has a slightly superior trackpad, with better accuracy. You cannot compare it to MacBooks, but you will definitely not be disappointed with this.  The  fingerprint sensor on the top right of the trackpad  is a bonus, and it’s also pretty fast for a scanner on a laptop.  Display  When you open up the notebook, you can see very thin bezels on the sides. The bezels are the only plastic you’ll see on the metal body of this laptop, which is a good thing. You’ll notice that the top bezel is a bit thicker than the sides, but that’s because of the webcam placement. The Dell XPS 13 has a thinner bezel up top. But it also has a weirdly placed web cam that captures your face at a weird angle during video sharing or calls.   The  14” display  of the laptop looks quite good and compact for its size. It’s a  Full HD resolution , that’s  1920 x 1080 pixels . It is a pretty sharp display as well as a  matte display , meaning that you won’t get a lot of reflection on your screen. And that’s actually a handy feature while consuming media, or just doing stuff.  Colors are vibrant, and also pretty accurate. The company does claim a  100% of Standard RGB  and about  71% of Adobe RGB  color accuracy. And that is also good enough for media creation or editing.  The one thing that disappointed me, is the brightness. With only about  290 nits of peak brightness , the laptop feels a bit dim. Yes, this is actually better than some budget gaming laptops like the Dell G7, for example. But the Dell G7 didn’t win any points for display, anyway. This laptop is less bright than the Dell XPS 13, and I wouldn’t even compare it to the 13-inch MacBook Pro! Low brightness level leads to very  illegible outside visibility , and is troubling when the display faces the window, making it unusable at a certain point.  Also read  Best Ultra Books to buy in Nepal  Performance  In the performance department, this laptop shines through and through. It comes with the latest  Quad-core 8 th  gen i7-8550U processor . Now this 15W processor is based on  14nm technology , and its  base clock is about 1.8 GHz , but it has been configured at 1.99 GHz in this laptop. \xa0It does go all the way  up to 4 GHz  when boosted, and combines a  16 GB RAM.\xa0 The RAM\xa0isn’t upgradeable by the way, but that much is enough to fly through most tasks. There are no lags or problems in performance whatsoever. Editing applications like Photoshop and Adobe Premier run pretty well. And even with some heavy sized files on them, it ran smooth enough for me.  Gaming Performance  We kind of know that ultra-portable notebooks like this one, aren’t meant for gaming. But it does come with a  2 GB MX150 graphics . Considering the size of the laptop, the MX150 is a nice graphic unit. It also helps with normal stuff like Photoshop and other Adobe suites.  As for gaming, you can play light games on this laptop, like CS: GO or DOTA 2. I also tried FIFA and they ran without any hiccups. Also, I tried PUBG for the sake of it, and it actually surprised me! Of course, I had to turn the settings all the way down to Very Low, FPS limiter at 30, and resolution set at 720, but with that, I was able to play the game through without much hiccups. Granted it’s not the ideal way to play games and this will create some disadvantages in games. But considering how this isn’t meant for gaming, I can’t complain.  However, if you want to play some other heavy set games like Battlefield or such, then, this is not the one for you. Or any kind of notebooks for that matter.  Thermals  Laptops of this size do face problems when it comes to heat management, especially, when they are this powerful. This laptop, too, has  a fan  and  one heat pipe\xa0 for heat dissipation, but it started to heat up after a few hours of usage. And to the point where I couldn’t keep it on my lap.  It gets very warm while gaming as well. The open hardware monitor temperatures showed thermals of above 90-degrees! They could be inaccurate, too. But nevertheless, this small laptop doesn’t do a good job at heat management.  Battery Life  The battery life on this thing is good, but not as good as the competition, like that of the Dell XPS 13. With a  50 Watt-hour  battery, it gives close to  7 hours of backup  under normal usage. With some heavy usage like having a few chrome tabs, word documents and Spotify running on the background, it pushes out over 5 hours of battery life. However, with the graphics turned on, you will face severe battery consumption.  Storage  As for the storage, you get a  512 GB SSD , which,  is NOT \xa0an  NVMe . But it’s still fast, providing about  550 MB/s of Read speeds  and up to  510 MB/s Write speeds  on our tests. If you want something faster, you can swap it out with an NVMe SSD. But, I think you won’t really need to, as this is pretty snappy.  Connectivity and Ports   As far as the connectivity goes, you have your regular  2 x 2 dual band 802.11 ac Wi-Fi.  It has a  720p HD webcam,\xa0 which is about the same as you’d find on other laptops, nothing remarkable.   In terms of ports, it has an  SD-card reader , and a  USB 2.0  on the right. On the left, you can find a Power connector, a  USB 3.1 , a  micro HDMI , an  Audio port  and a  USB-C 3.1  with NO Thunderbolt. Even though full-sized HDMI’s are a thing of the past, I would’ve liked a full sized HDMI port. It can make quite a difference in terms of office usage. I mean, it’s just another hassle to get a mini HDMI dongle! Also, if the USB-C could’ve supported Thunderbolt, that would’ve been immensely better.  Conclusion and Verdict  To conclude, this is a laptop for those who want lightweight portability along with a sturdy build. It also gives you really good performance, and all that, for the price of  Rs.130000 in Nepal  isn’t bad. Considering it  costs $1100 internationally , this is priced appropriately here too.  Now, I’ve been comparing this laptop with the Dell XPS 13 this whole time. And while that does outshine the ASUS Zenbook UX430U in quite a few aspects, the XPS 13 will cost you above Rs.150000 for similar specs. Also, on top, it doesn’t even offer a dedicated graphics configuration.  For 1 lakh 30 thousand, I think it’s a worthy purchase. Having said that, note that this one not having Thunderbolt support or full-sized HDMI could be a downside for some. You might also miss out on a laptop that runs cool, but can you really expect that from a laptop of this size? I think not.  Pros:   Good Design and Sturdy Build  Good Keyboard and trackpad  Great performance  Adequate battery life   Cons:   Low Brightness  Slower Storage (No NVMe SSD)  Quick Heating']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/asus-zenbook-ux430u-review.jpg']

['Samsung Galaxy J2 Core Review – An armlength away from Samsung'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['October 1, 2018']",2018-10-01 11:32:56+00:00,"['The Samsung Galaxy J2 Core is an “ambitious” smartphone from Samsung. The company is widely criticized for their lack of attention in the budget segment, which should have changed with the new Samsung Galaxy J2 Core. And it did, but they could have and should have done a lot more. When they released the previous  Galaxy J2 2018 , we highly criticized them for not optimizing the software of the device, which they did improve, thanks to the Android GO implementation. But while doing so, compromised on the specs and the display of the device. So how is the device overall? Let find out in this Samsung Galaxy J2 Core review.  Samsung Galaxy J2 Core Specifications:   Display : 5.0-inch qHD 540×960 resolution display  CPU : 1.4GHz Quad Core Exynos 7570 14nm processor  OS : Android 8.1 Oreo (Go Edition)  RAM : 1GB  GPU : Mali-T720  Storage : 8 GB  Expandable Memory:\xa0 Up to 256 GB (dedicated)  Rear Camera : 8MP F/2.2, Autofocus with LED flash  Front Camera : 5MP f/2.2  Sensors : Accelerometer, proximity, location  SIM:  Dual SIM (Micro-SIM) 4G Support  Battery : 2,600mAH removable battery  Price: \xa0Rs 11,690    Build and Design   As you can guess, it’s a  plastic build  with minimal design choices. The back is comprised of a removable plastic\xa0slab with a cut out for the rear camera and the loudspeaker. Other than that you get the Samsung logo and nothing else. The back is a fingerprint and scratch magnet, although it feels very sturdy.        The volume controls are on the left and the power button on the right. The top is completely empty whereas the bottom gets the MicroUSB port, a mic, and an audio jack. The front is mostly the qHD display, front camera, and a call speaker. Even though it is a 16:9 display, Samsung has decided to skip on its famous home button and replace it with another Samsung logo. I don’t have an idea why, but if you do, let me know too…  This design focuses more on functionality\xa0and durability rather than aesthetics. It doesn’t feel premium but does give you a healthy boost of confidence as it fits perfectly in your hand. The smartphone is pretty durable, and can handle a few drops and in general some rough usage.  Display   Samsung didn’t include their famous AMOLED technology\xa0this time around, thanks to which they managed to price it so low. Even though it’s a  TFT display , it still manages to provide a really nice viewing experience. There is very less shift in color even under extreme angles and the brightness is also not half as bad as on some other devices.  An HD display at this price is a luxury which the J2 core doesn’t offer. The  lack of resolution  does affect your usage a bit, like while going through your Facebook timeline or just watching a YouTube video, but I have seen much worse. To be fair I have seen much better as well.  Cameras  The cameras follow the same story as on previous J2 devices. They produce pretty nice photos under good lighting conditions but need very steady hands, to begin with. The  rear 8 MP camera  produced photos with a fine amount of details, ample vibrancy and overall usable photos for social media platforms.      Samsung Galaxy J2 Core Camera Samples   1  of 9                                                                                                            For more hi-res image samples,  click here .  The lowlight performance, however, is a different story, with grainy, blurry and pretty much some of the worst photos a phone can take. The flash helps a lot under low light situations, but nobody likes how a picture was taken with the help of a smartphone flash.  Finally, the  5 MP front camera  puts out some really really decent selfies, some of the best I might have seen in its category. But you do need really steady hands for any type of decent results and more importantly, lowlight selfies are a No No. You also get a beauty mode but I recommend you stay away from that.  Performance  It’s a  Quad-Core processor , with just  1GB of RAM  but it wasn’t really a bad performer. Most of it was thanks to the optimized user experience, so I didn’t even bother with the benchmarks. It’s a toned down version of Android Oreo meant to run of smartphones with relatively lower specs and it does.  It was a totally different experience compared to when I used J2 devices in the past. Even games run pretty well. I didn’t try games like PUBG (what’s the point?) or Asphalt, but smaller and less-graphics intensive games like Clash Royal or Knife hit worked well. Apps open fast and not once did the smartphone freeze on me.  I would recommend you not leave apps in the background as it hogs memory and makes the smartphone unusable.  Software and UI  If you made it this far of this review, you already know that this smartphone works pretty well. The software is very optimized and useless functions have been removed completely. It is still Android Oreo Go edition with Samsung’s own customizations on top. If you have ever used a Samsung device in the past you will feel right at home.\xa0That is until you start opening apps and actually start using the device.      Samsung Galaxy J2 Core UI   1  of 4               Lite Apps         Storage options         Ultra saving apps         Go apps                        Most of the apps are stripped down less functional but more responsive and less resource hogging version of the apps. You can recognize these apps as they come with words like “Go” or “Lite” right in the name. For eg., the Maps Go, Youtube Go, Facebook Lite, Twitter Lite, Messenger Lite and such. You can find these apps in the Play Store itself and will work a lot better than their full versions.  You also get Samsung Max Go with it’s what Samsung likes to call “Ultra Apps”. Basically, it’s a VPN paired with a lightweight browser that enables users to load apps quicker. All it does is opens the mobile versions of a website but mimics an app and is said to save data.  On a happier note, this one should get the Android Pie update in the coming few months.  Battery   It comes with a  2600mAh battery  which is also removable, pair that with a 14nm processor and a qHD display, seems like a perfect recipe for great battery life. It’s not great, but you can go up to a day’s usage without any problems. I also didn’t experience any type of severe without reason battery draining problems.  The charging isn’t fast either,  takes above 2 hours to fully charge  from 0%. I never once had to charge it in the middle of the day or worry about the phone not lasting a full days usage as long as I threw it in the charger every night.  Storage  Storage wise, you only get a mere  8 GB  which is expandable. The phone supports a  maximum of 256GB memory card  which should be adequate. On the plus side, the software allows you to move the apps to the SD card itself, which is a rare feature to have. All you have to do is go to “Settings” then “Apps and notifications” then select “All Apps”. Now select an app, there you will find “Storage”. Give it a light touch\xa0and there you will find a menu with “Storage Used” with a change option right beneath it. Select that and then select your desired location. Now, you might not find the change option, which could be due to two reasons.   You do not have an SD card inserted  The app does not support SD card.   Connectivity  You get the regular  2.4Ghz 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi ,  Bluetooth 4.2  and an  OTG support  while sensors include an accelerometer, proximity and location.\xa0The speakers are fine, which was a real concern for me. Distortion is pretty less and loudness is also of no concern. It lacks a few sensors and features like a second mic, gyro sensor, compass or an NFC chip.  The smartphone does come with dual-SIM support but with a few compromises. For one it’s a MicroSIM, so your regular nano-SIM will be a little too small for the holder. The phone does support 4G but only on SIM 1; SIM 2 will be stuck at 2G connectivity.  Conclusion  The Samsung Galaxy J2 Core is a great smartphone, a solid try from Samsung. Although the specs could have been slightly better. An AMOLED display could have also made things a lot better but at this point, I am asking a bit more. It still performs really well, thanks to the optimized stripped down version of Android Oreo.  I might recommend this smartphone to first-time smartphone buyers who are coming from feature phones. But for anyone who is already using a smartphone, you can look elsewhere. The Xiaomi Redmi 6A could be a better option for Rs 12,999, which does deliver on a bigger and better display, improved performance, slightly better cameras and much more.  You might also try your luck with online stores. They are providing better value for your money. For instance, the Xperia L1 is currently on sale at Sasto deal for just Rs 12,000. That offers immensely better performance and a lot better design language. You can also get the Gionee S11 Lite for a huge discount of on Daraz as well which is also a better option than the Galaxy J2 Core.

But now, you can also see  Xiaomi’s Online Store  selling the phone there. However, Xiaomi’s own official website doesn’t have any such listings. It is pretty complicated.   Besides that, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro is listed by plenty of sellers now. It was officially seen in  Xiaomi’s Thai Forum  first, but now, it’s there all over. And with this, the rumors about this phone having a variant with 6 GB RAM is debunked. This phone still comes in two versions, yes, but in the same manner as the Redmi 5 Pro. A  3 GB RAM / 32 GB  storage and a  4 GB RAM / 64 GB  variant.         Other specs still hold true, though.

Shipping time varies according to the sellers, ranging from 20 days to 60. This could be a red flag, but with so many sellers selling it, I guess, we don’t have to worry anymore. Also, with Xiaomi’s Thai Forum making it official on their  Facebook Page , it is closer to being authentic now.  Now, why Xiaomi’s doing this, we don’t know. Launching the phone in a not-so-well-known forum and not worldwide, even though the sellers are claiming it to be the global version. Plus, it is still early for the Redmi Note 6 Pro to be coming out, isn’t it? The Redmi Note 5 Pro only came in February.  Also read  Xiaomi Mobiles Price in Nepal  And all of this creates the question “Will it be available to the rest of the world?” It should, because, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro, or the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI  in Nepal, was a very popular.

The base model that comes with 4GB/64GB is priced at Rs 13,990. The slightly larger 6GB/64GB comes in at Rs 15,990 and finally, the full-fledged 8GB/128GB variant will cost you Rs 17,990.\xa0Although the more exciting news is that the smartphone will be made available outside India. Global rollout will be announced on October with a possible launch in Nepal as well.

And we do like such devices to come in Nepal.\xa0 So we had a brief conversation with the Oppo Nepal official regarding the Realme 2 Pro. And the good thing is that they were positive about bringing the product to Nepal. So when the Realme 2 Pro comes to Nepal, it won’t be a surprise.  Although they hesitated to give a solid date, the phone could launch in Nepal with 1-2 weeks. Even if the things do not go as planned, it may not cross the 1-month time frame. Talking about the price, we can expect the handset to come at the price close to the international pricing with the extra added tax. Nonetheless, even at the price, it would offer a great value for money.  Also Watch: Oppo F9 Full Review: After 1 month of use!   Also Watch: Vivo V11 Pro Review: After 48 hours!

['Xiaomi Pocophone F1 Review: Beauty lies on the inside'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Xiaomi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['September 27, 2018']",2018-09-27 09:13:11+00:00,"['When prime flagships are revolving around the price of some $1000, the  Pocophone F1  came out of nowhere and took the smartphone market by storm. A $300 phone having flagship specs got everyone intrigued and even raised a few eyebrows. And then came all the comparisons, even against those smartphones that cost three times its price. And yes, you probably have seen a lot of reviews on the Poco F1. But, here are my impressions on the Xiaomi Pocophone F1 after a month of usage.   Xiaomi Pocophone F1 Specifications:   Operating System : Android Oreo 8.0  Display : 6.18-inches IPS LCD  Resolution : 1080 x 2246 pixels  CPU : Octa-core\xa04×2.8 GHz Kryo 385 Gold & 4×1.8 GHz Kryo 385 Silver  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 845  GPU : Adreno 630  RAM : 6 or 8 GB  Storage : 64 or 128 or 256 GB  Rear Camera : 12 MP f/1.8 + 5 MP depth sensor, Dual LED flash, Panorama, HDR, etc.  Front Camera : 20 MP f/2.0  Battery : 4,000 mAh Li-Po non-removable with Quick charge 3.0  Connectivity : Wi-Fi 802.11 a/c/b/g/n, WiFi Direct, Hotspot, Bluetooth 5.0  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear- mounted), Accelerometer, Proximity, Gyro, Barometer, Compass, Infrared Face Recognition.  Price (6/64GB) : INR 20,999 (Rs. 33,600 or $300)  Price (6/128GB) : INR 23,999 (Rs. 38,400 or $343)  Price (8/256GB) : INR 28,999 (Rs. 46,400 or $415)  Price (Armoured Edition, 8/256GB) : INR 29,999 (Rs. 48,000 or $429)   Performance  Well, let’s start by talking about the most intriguing feature of this device, the  Snapdragon 845 chipset  with the liquid cooling system. With a flagship chipset and more than enough RAM at disposal, I played a lot of games on this phone and the performance was fluid. I did not face any sort of lags or stutter even while playing in high settings.        After my success with PUBG, I tried installing  Asphalt 8  and Asphalt 9 as well. However, the phone does not support these games. Although Jai Mani, the head of the product branch of Pocophone announced via tweet that the issue with the Asphalt 9 was resolved, I am still having some problems with it. I couldn’t find Asphalt 9 on the Play Store in the Pococphone. And when I tried to download it through my browser, it redirected to Google Play, which, simply mentioned that the device didn’t support it. So you have that.    Infographic Modern  Infogram  I also played other high-end games like Dead Trigger 2, Shadowgun Legends, and Dream League Soccer. And I enjoyed it. One thing that I really liked it how the phone stayed relatively cool during gaming sessions, which was quite great. All thanks to its Liquid Cooling technology, and also the plastic back, which dissipates less heat. This is a really cool feature for a smartphone available at $300.  We pitted the Xiaomi Pocophone F1 against the  Galaxy Note 9  and  OnePlus 6  for a PUBG session in HDR graphics and Ultra Frame rate settings.  Camera  Another good thing about this device is the camera setup. The Poco F1 offered me a pleasant surprise while capturing the images. I did not have much expectation from the phone since the Xiaomi phones had fairly disappointed us in the past on the camera department. But with the Poco F1, you can get images with plenty of details, decent color accuracy, and respectable dynamic range.        1  of 5                                                                    Under ample lighting conditions, you can get some amazing photos. However, the low light shots were not that impressive. The images contain noises and grains as you can see in these images.        1  of 4                                                          The pair of camera on the back is meant only for depth sensing. The portrait images do have great edge-detection and intelligent background blurring. And in most of the times, the portrait photos captured from the Poco F1 does look like they are shot from the premium handsets.        1  of 4                                                          Even on the video side, the Poco F1 is equally great. Although the phone lacks  Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) , there is an  Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)  to keep the shakes and vibration in the videos to the minimum. And the captured videos do have quite a stability to them. Subjects in the videos too possess sufficient amount of sharpness in them. So I don’t have complaints here. What I liked among all the features in the phone is the ability to shoot HD and Full-HD videos at 240fps. While this feature really comes handy when capturing slow-motion videos, the slow-motion is not as good as you’d find on other phones.  Talking about selfies, there is a 20MP selfie shooter. Selfies taken from the phone looks really great with abundant details in them. There is also a beauty mode to enhance your selfies for enhancing the skin tone and removing acne and facial blemishes.        1  of 5                                                                    On the Poco F1, you get portrait mode even on the selfies. This does take your mainstream selfies to another level but it is not particularly impressive. Since there is just a single camera on the front, detecting the edges and blurring the background is done entirely through the software. So, the portrait selfies are usually a hit or a miss. But, there are plenty of phones that manage to take better portrait selfies even with a single selfie camera.  Comparing the camera with the  Galaxy Note 9  and the  One Plus 6 , the Pocophone F1 holds its own against the beast. There are some differences in the pictures, as it falls short of the Galaxy Note 9 and One Plus 6 image quality, but that’s not very noticeable. The difference is justified by the difference in price among these phones.  To check out all the images in high resolution,  Click here .  Design and Build  The other thing I am not particularly impressed with on this device is the design and build. The design of this device is nothing exciting. With a thickness of 8.8mm, it really looks bulky and kind of unattractive. And it has a polycarbonate back, which is just a fancy name for plastic. The plastic back has surely cut down the weight and made it lighter, but it feels cheap on the hold and on the use.   Xiaomi is known for providing metal backs even on their budget phones. Yes, it’s technically not Xiaomi, it’s the sub-brand Pocophone, but this compromise on a so-claimed “flagship killer” does not seem like a plausible step for me. But it’s here, if you don’t like it you can apply a case as well.   There are some advantages with the back as it does not attract fingerprints, so, I did not have to clean it like some of the other flagships. Also, flagship phones with glass usually slip through my hands but since it has a sturdy polycarbonate back, even after the falls, damages were pretty minimal. You can see it for yourself, even after I have dropped it a few times, it still looks good as new.  Software  And talking about something that is NOT new here is the software experience. Xiaomi has added its custom skin MIUI 9.6 on top. MIUI has always lacked an app drawer all these years. But this time, they provided an app drawer in this one, due to which, browsing through apps is relatively easier.   But still, it has not given up on the bloatware. Putting the bloatware issues aside, the Poco F1 is also being criticized for having the DRM or the digital right management Security level of L3 and not L1. This means that you can view contents on Amazon Prime and Netflix only at the maximum resolution of 540p. Streaming HD and Full-HD videos is not possible when the security level is at L3.   The reason for the lockout is that these services are protected by digital rights management (DRM) to prevent the copying and unauthorized redistribution of these kinds of video files.  Most of the smartphones like the OPPO F9, VIVO V11 still have that issue and many people are cool with it. On a small screen of the smartphones that is not quite noticeable. And in the countries like Nepal and India, where the internet is not so fast to stream even the 540p videos, users can barely notice the difference. There are also rumors about fixing the issue with a software update, and I really wish it to be true.  However, this phone is also susceptible to advertisements. What I mean by that is, if you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network, you will see various ads even when you open File Manager or settings. As annoying as that can be, these are one of the reasons the Pocophone is cheap. So, this is something you have to get used to if you have the Pocophone.  Speaker  On the Poco F1, there’s a speaker on the right grill and the earpiece forms a stereo speaker setup. With this setup, the sound output from the phone is quite loud and clear. Now it may not have the depth in sound for various genres of music like the flagship phones do but is not that disappointing either. And while playing games, even if the bottom-firing speaker gets obstructed, the sound makes its way to you through the earpiece.  Connectivity  Even on the connectivity side, I have no complaints about the Poco F1. Wi-Fi connectivity and download speed are really great. There was appreciable voice clarity in the phone calls and I did not face any call drops using both the NTC and Ncell SIM cards.  Digging deep into the connectivity side, I found that the phone lacks NFC feature. It might be another aspect where Xiaomi made a cut. Although the absence of the NFC is not a huge deal in the countries like Nepal and India, users in US and European regions may not be able to get along without the feature.  Security  The area where Xiaomi has been generous is in the security. This phone comes with a Fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock feature as a biometric authentication tool. The fingerprint on the phone is really fast. It unlocks the phone almost instantaneously. And for the Face Unlock feature, the front camera and IR sensor come into play. With this setup, the facial mapping is accurate and unlocking the handset with this feature is abrupt as well. Even on the pitch-dark condition, the unlocking speed was somewhat similar. And there was no additional problem whatsoever. So I must say the Infrared sensor has done a really good job here.  Display  On the front, you get a 6.2-inch IPS Panel. Although the IPS display does fail to reproduce pitch black and inky colors like the Super AMOLED displays, I was not disappointed with the color accuracy on the phone. I was fairly impressed with the viewing angle, contrast ratio, and the color saturation. However, the thick bezel at the bottom and a wide notch on the top are definitely something you need to live up with.   Xiaomi has squeezed an earpiece and various sensors including the IR sensor in that notch whereas, the chin houses a notification LED. It is really a weird place to put a notification LED and it took a lot of time for me to get used to it. Whether it be in a weird place, having one is definitely better than having none. So I was ok about it after spending some time with it.   Continuing with the display, the Poco F1 features Full-HD+ resolution and looks sufficiently bright. It has good sunlight visibility. So, even on a bright sunny day, I did not have any problems while viewing the contents on the phone. The phone is also said to come with an old gen Gorilla Glass 3 protection. But since I am absolutely careless with my phone, I put on a tempered glass before I started using it.  Battery  Now, I had mentioned earlier that the phone looks bulkier with a thickness of 8.8mm, and the battery is one of the reasons for it. Poco F1 sports a massive 4000mAh battery, which backed me for more than a day on the normal usage. At the end of the day, I always ended up with 25% to 30% on my phone. So I was fairly satisfied with the backup. Charging the battery is also quite hassle-free on the phone. Unlike the iPhones, the smartphone comes bundled with a quick charger Version 3, with which the battery is refilled in around 1 hour and 45 minutes. The phone does support Quick Charge 4+\xa0 but availability is an issue here in Nepal.  Conclusion and Verdict  The Poco F1 has made some compromises to keep the prices low. And the plastic back is one of them. However, it is not a huge deal and users can surely live with it by putting a premium case. Since the phone is targeted to the Asian users, the absence of NFC is not that noticeable as well. And talking about the Digital Right Management, I believe that the Poco F1 was pushed forward as a scapegoat. A lot of popular phones are still running with the DRM Security level of L3. So nitpicking that flaw on Poco F1 might have been intentionally brought to kill the hype of the Poco F1.  To sum it up, Poco F1 is a great phone, which costs one-third the price of  iPhone XS  or the  Galaxy Note 9  and nearly half the price of the “flagship killer”  OnePlus 6 . So needless to say, the Poco F1 offers a great value for money. Except for a few downsides, Poco F1 is obviously one of the best smartphones on the market for the money. We do not deny that there are plenty of rooms for improvements on the phone. And we hope that Xiaomi will come with all the issues fixed and with better hardware & design on the Poco F2.  Unfortunately, as great as this phone is, its availability is pretty limited. It doesn’t cater to markets like US, Canada, or such. And even though it goes on Flash sales in India, as of now it’s not available in Nepal. For now, we can only rely on Xiaomi Nepal to make it available here soon.

['Microsoft launches Office 2019 for Windows and Mac'],['Microsoft'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['September 26, 2018']",2018-09-26 09:09:28+00:00,"['Microsoft recently released Office 2019 for Windows and Mac operating systems. After the Office 2016, this is the first time the company’s flagship software received such a huge update. This new Microsoft Office 2019, however, has been targeted at the consumers, who have not yet chosen the Microsoft Office 365 service with the monthly feature updates.  Over the years, Microsoft seems to be obsessed with luring the consumers to its cloud-based services. However, this time the company stepped up and showed that it has forgotten about those who want a one-and-done purchase. So the company with high hopes and utter generosity has rolled out the Microsoft Office 2019 for Mac and Windows, providing a subset of upgrades that used to be in the Office 365 in the past three years.  “Office 2019 will be a valuable upgrade for customers who feel that they need to keep some or all of their apps on servers on-premises,” the company said in a press release.  It is worth noting that the new software will run only on Windows 10 and not on Windows 7, 8 or 8.1. Also, the software is available for Microsoft’s Commercial volume license (trusted) customers as of now. And for all the consumers who do not fall on that category should have to wait for few weeks to use the software.        Microsoft Office 2019 and Office 365: What are the differences?  Since most of the features in Office 2019 and Office 365 are the same, it has created quite a lot of confusions on the consumers’ side. So let me clear it out for you.  Here is a major difference: MS office 2019 is software, which requires a one-time time purchase. After the purchase, the consumers can use it for eternity without paying further for the same services. And in this kind of purchase, the users won’t receive any sorts of feature updates after making the purchase. You can receive quality updates and security patches, but no new tools or functionality will ever be added into the software.  In contrast, the Office 365 is a subscription-based service. And unlike the Office 2019, the Office 365 is powered by Microsoft cloud. So it includes more up to date and collaborative features than what the regular MS office or the Microsoft’s perpetual software offers.  All or most of the features in the Microsoft Office 2019 will mostly be present in the cloud-based Office 365. The major intentional of bringing the new update with improved features is to lure the customers, who like to pay only for one time for the service and doesn’t really require access to new tools and functionality.  New features in Microsoft Office 2019  1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Advance presentation features  PowerPoint is one of the most popular solutions for the presentations. And still, it has been a go-to feature for most of the people. However, with the development of advanced options for the presentations, PowerPoint seems to be dated in the recent days. So to stay more relevant in the presentation games, Microsoft has brought some advanced features in this new update. The new features added in the software are enhanced Morph and Zoom capabilities to help the users to create a more sophisticated and dynamic presentation.  Although this feature was already existent on the Office 365 ProPlus, it was not available in the Office 2016.  2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 More Powerful data analysis  In the matter of data handling and management, Excel is still on the acme. And this time, the company has injected some new features to set a new benchmark for the data management software.   With the new version of the software, users will be able to access new and more powerful features like new formulas, new charts (like funnel charts and 2D maps), the ability to publish from Excel to\xa0Power BI\xa0(Microsoft’s own business analytics service), and enhancements for\xa0PowerPivot\xa0and\xa0PowerQuery.  3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Improved inking features  We have seen S-pen on the  Samsung Galaxy Note 9  and the  Microsoft Surface devices . Such digital pens quite sophisticatedly allow the users to draw, note, and doodle directly onto the device’s screen. This feature not just look fancy, it also gives the opportunity to the users to use the software interactively.   And Microsoft has adopted the feature in Office 2019 to encourage maximum productivity. It has introduced the new inking capabilities across all the apps—such as pressure sensitivity, tilt effects that adjust the ink’s thickness depending on the angle of the pen, and even a roaming pencil case, which allows users to store and organize their favorite pens, pencils, and highlighters to roam with them across their different devices.  4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Easier Email management  Microsoft has not yet forgotten its Outlook users. In this new update, Microsoft has brought several new features to make the email management tasks easier and hassle-free. And Microsoft is quite hopeful that, with the new features, users will now able to manage their emails effectively and efficiently.  According to Microsoft, these include things like:   Updated contact cards  Office 365 Groups  @mentions  Focused inbox  Travel package cards']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/microsoft-office-2019.jpg']

['OPPO F9 Full review: A water drop above the competition'],"['OPPO', 'Reviews']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['September 25, 2018']",2018-09-25 11:15:54+00:00,"['The competition among mid-range smartphones is intriguing. These phones are trying their best to come add something new. Some bring out 4 cameras while others give us an in-display fingerprint scanner. And some give us top-notch specs in a small price tag. And there still seems to be a lot to see. These smartphones companies are battling it out, but as long as we, consumers get new and interesting stuff, it’s quite alright. We have the  OPPO F9  in for review. This phone features something called a water- drop display. Does the OPPO F9 surpass its competition? Let’s find out in this review!   OPPO F9 specifications:   Display : 6.3-inch Full HD+ LTPS IPS LCD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 6  CPU : Octa-core MediaTek Helio P60  OS : Android 8.1 Oreo with ColorOS 5.2 on top  RAM : 4/6 GB  GPU : Mali-G72 MP3  Storage : 64 GB  Expandable Memory:\xa0 Up to 256 GB (dedicated)  Rear Camera : Dual 16 + 2 MP lens with f/1.8 aperture and f/2.4 aperture, PDAF, LED flash  Front Camera : 25 MP front-facing camera, f/2.0 aperture  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:\xa0 Dual SIM with 4G  Battery : 3,500 mAh with VOOC Flash Charge  Price (4 GB): \xa0Rs. 41,590   Price (6 GB): \xa0Rs. 45,590   [Note: Prices last updated on December 6, 2018]        Design:  The F9 is quite an appealing device. The design is such that it gives off a shiny appearance of a glass body. At first glance, you might not even notice its plastic construction, but you will certainly feel the difference in your hands. The  Huawei Nova 3i (Read review)  takes the lead when it comes to premium feel, but I like what OPPO has done with the gradient back color and the diamond patterns. If only this was a glass body, I wouldn’t have wished for any improvement on the design front. I have the red version which is named ‘Sunrise Red’ by OPPO, but if you are not a fan of this color, there are other options available too.   As for aesthetics, the power button is placed at the right with the volume rockers as well as the SIM/memory card slot just above it. The button placement is quite convenient and though the device is large, it’s very comfortable to reach all of them. Similarly, at the bottom, there’s a single speaker grill with the Micro USB port beside it, a noise cancellation mic and not to miss, the headphone jack. The back houses nothing but the dual cameras, an LED flash, a fingerprint sensor, which is easily reachable, and the OPPO branding just below the sensor.   The OPPO F9 feels very light on hands and is also very comfortable to hold. While the Nova 3i felt slippery, this one gives you quite a grip. But since the device is huge, one-handed use is a struggle, especially for someone with small hands like me.   Display:  A water drop display. Sounds fancy? Well, actually, it’s called so, because the tiny notch on top looks like a drop of water. And it is the smallest notch we’ve seen since the Essential phone. The small notch houses nothing but the selfie camera and very cleverly hides the speaker grills right above it. Well, there is no fancy Dual cameras on this one, but again, the question is, do you really need one?   Moving on, the device has a 6.3 inch IPS LCD FHD+ display panel. And as I already said in my hands-on review, it’s quite vibrant, has nice colors, and good viewing angles which pretty much accounts for a good display experience overall. The sunlight legibility is also excellent as the display is very bright. Also, While watching videos or playing games, the small notch is less obstructive and same is the case with Instagram stories. The F9 gives you a 19.5:9 aspect ratio with very thin bezels. So, viewing content on this one has been a pleasing experience. Another welcoming trait of this device is it’s one of the very first to feature  Gorilla Glass 6 , which in my opinion, is very ambitious for a mid-range device.  Cameras:  OPPO claims itself as the ‘Selfie Expert and Leader’, which is why we have to do a thorough camera test. The selfie camera definitely impresses you. It’s a 25 MP shooter with f/2.0 aperture. The selfies are bright, vibrant and pack in a good amount of colors.   You have a lot of effects for selfies too, like, Selfie Portrait effect, which is purely software. The result is however of average quality with slightly inaccurate depth sensing. Having said that, I liked the HDR feature which makes the pictures look good in bright environments too. There’s also a super Vivid mode which helps make the pictures more colorful, but sometimes, makes photos look a little too over-saturated.      OPPO F9 Selfie Camera Samples   1  of 3                                                There is a beauty mode which functions okay in the first levels, but after that, you start looking like a doll.      OPPO F9 Selfies| Normal Vs Beauty   1  of 4               Beauty Level: OFF         Beauty Level: 1         Beauty Level: 2         Beauty Level: 3                        Night selfies are surprisingly well if there is enough light, but as the surroundings get darker, you will notice grains and loss in detail.\xa0The AR stickers are there too, like its predecessor OPPO F7. But this time there are a lot more choices among stickers and they are quite fun to use. I compared the selfies of the F9 with that of the Nova 3i and found the F9’s selfies to be better in aspects like color and vibrancy. But details are slightly better preserved on the Nova 3i. However, pictures on the 3i look a bit pale when put side by side with OPPO F9. Overall, I must say that I quite like the selfie experience on this device.  Moving on to the rear cameras, there is a 16 MP primary sensor and a 2 MP depth sensor on the dual camera setup. Apart from the pictures having slightly inaccurate color reproduction, other aspects seem covered quite well by OPPO. The pictures appear to be full of life. Details are well preserved too.      OPPO F9 Back Camera Samples   1  of 8                                                                                                  However, in the portrait images, you cannot turn off beautification which sets me off a bit. You do have various lighting options for portrait, which sounds fancy but are not very impressive. Most of the times, portrait images loose details and the edge detection is not very proper either.      OPPO F9 Portrait Samples   1  of 2                                      The camera does identify various objects, which, again is a form of AI that almost all the smartphones seem to have these days. Upon recognizing the objects and scenery, a small icon appears on the top-right corner, indicating that the AI has successfully identified the object. It will, then, tweak some settings thereafter, adjusting the colors and so. It is not very accurate though.      OPPO F9 | Normal Vs Super Vivid Mode   1  of 2               Normal Mode         Super Vivid Mode                  Like with the front camera, there’s a Super Vivid mode on the back that acts to add saturation to pictures, but I liked the normal images better. The HDR feature does work but I didn’t find a lot of difference with the HDR on. Similarly, like the Vivo V11 Pro, there is Google Lens built in the cameras which is an added feature. Likewise, night time shots are okay at best.      OPPO F9 | Non-HDR VS HDR   1  of 2               Non-HDR         HDR                  Like the Nova 3i, there is a Pro mode, which is here called the ‘expert mode’. This gives you options to change things like ISO levels, White Balance, etc. Talking about other features, the output from the Slow- Mo feature is just average and results in loss of quality. Also, you don’t have a 4K recording feature and videos can be recorded either in 1080p or 720p only at 30fps and there isn’t any kind of stabilization in them as well which is, very disappointing to say the least.  All in all, the pictures from the F9 are pretty good but there’s a lot of room for improvement, especially in the portrait department and video recording.  To check out all the images in high resolution,\xa0 click here  Performance:  Moving on to the performance, the  Helio P60 chipset  underneath, impressed us in the  OPPO F7 (Read review)  and the same has been used in the F9 as well. So, the performance is about the same. I did not experience any stutters while navigating, multitasking or gameplay for that matter. But, what I did, is compared the gameplay between the Huawei Nova 3i and OPPO F9 and found the F9 to have a slight edge over its rival. Regular performance between these devices is more or less similar.  However, the storage department is where the Nova 3i beats the F9 as you get 4+64 GB version here and the 3i offers you 4+128 GB version for a lesser price tag. Sure, you can expand the memory using the dedicated micro SD card slot too.  Adding on to the performance side, there is something in-built called the “Game Space” feature, which comes in handy while gaming. With this feature, you can choose to play games without any disturbances from calls and notifications. OPPO also claims that it boosts the gaming performance, but, I didn’t feel anything of that sort.   It’s fair to say that OPPO phones always have good and fast facial recognition, but, since there is no IR sensor, it’s not as reliable. But you can always rely on the Fingerprint sensor which is also one of the fastest and it’s really nice to see that it’s in a comfortable position.  The single speaker at the bottom is decent with fewer distortions, but, at loud volumes, you can feel the distortions. The audio from the 3.5mm headphone jack has an average dynamic range and response. As for call quality, I used the NTC and Ncell SIM during my review period and had no problems. Similarly, Wi-Fi connectivity is not an issue in this device and it supports 5 GHz network too.  Software:  Software-wise, you get the Android Oreo 8.1 topped with heavily customized ColorOS 5.2. I have said it already and will say it again, I am not a fan of the UI in OPPO phones or even Vivo phones for that matter. The most annoying is having to slide and delete the notifications. I mean, you either have to erase them all at once, or go one by one sliding and deleting. But unlike Vivo phones, at least, you have the search option in the settings menu.   Also, there is no app drawer and you have all your apps lying on the home screen. As for the large icons, you have different themes that you can set for your preference. Similarly, you have an option to enable or disable navigation keys. I like it when companies provide options and let us be in control. But, the absence of LED notification lights is disappointing. It is something that I need and sadly, the F9 doesn’t have it. I guess the water drop display has its own shortcomings. There are also gesture features like many phones have, so nothing new in that department.      OPPO F9 | Software & UI    1  of 5                                                                    Battery:  The OPPO F9 has a 3500 mAh battery paired with its own custom VOOC charging support. You get a 5V 4A charger that helps you gain a charge of 55% in around 30 minutes. The battery endures pretty well. There are various power saving modes that help you make your battery life better but I haven’t had the necessity to use one as the battery is very enduring in itself.   During my normal usage, which includes social media and gameplay along with work stuff and a lot of making calls, the battery gave me a full day’s support with some charge left even after. So, for normal use, the battery lasts for a little more than a day. The presence of a Micro USB is definitely a bummer here, but I think fast charging support covers for it anyway. Although a USB-C would have felt nicer.  Conclusion:  The OPPO F9 is definitely a good value for money, at least for Nepal. In India and other parts of the world, you should, however, get the  Poco F1  or the Honor Play for less price. But since none of these devices are available in Nepal, the Oppo F9 is a nice package overall with good performance, excellent battery life, a decent set of cameras, good enough design and trendy notch display. Yes, the UI is something I didn’t like but I think it’s a small sacrifice you have to make.  If you are looking for a better design option, or maybe one with a more storage capacity, you may also consider the Nova 3i. Otherwise, what you get more in the F9 is faster charging, Gorilla Glass 6 protection and 5GHz Wi-Fi connectivity. Other aspects are more or less the same.       Pros    Cons     Pleasing display  Plastic Build    Unique patterned design  Poor AI functioning in cameras    Good selfie and back cameras in ample lighting  Average low light camera performance    Satisfactory gaming performance  Inconvenient UI features']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/oppo-f9-full-review.jpg']

This budget smartphone has just received a whopping discount. The phone now lies on the shelf of Sastodeal with a 40% off in its original price.  In terms of display, the Sony Xperia L1 comes with the 5.5-inch display. The display on the handset features HD (1280 x 720 pixels) resolutions packing 267 PPI in every inch. To shield the display from the scratches, the display has also been provided with the scratch-resistant glass on the top.  Sony smartphones are greatly renowned for their cameras. And the Sony Xperia L1 is one of the capable camera phones at its price. The phone boasts a 13MP camera at the back with f/2.2 aperture. And up front, there is a 5MP, f/2.2 selfie shooter. Both the cameras promise to deliver some amazing photos with a great amount of details.        The Xperia L1 is powered by the MediaTek MT6737T chipset. There is also 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage. The storage on the phone can be further expanded up to 256GB via SD card. On the software side of things, the phone features Android Nougat out of the box.  In terms of battery, the phone is equipped with a 2620mAh non-removable battery. But given the specs, we can expect a decent battery life from the smartphone.

Although the Nokia 2 (price Rs.11,499) comes with the whopping 4100mAh battery, it comes with a mediocre chipset, less storage, and below-par cameras. The Huawei Y3 2018 (price Rs.11,400), on the other hand, features a low-res (480 x 854 pixels) display, less storage, very average cameras, and a smaller battery. Similarly, the Moto C (price Rs. 10,900) also have low-res (480 x 854 pixels) display, less RAM, very average cameras and a smaller battery.

['Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Review: Worth every penny!'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['September 24, 2018']",2018-09-24 10:00:52+00:00,"['The first thing that you will want to do when you get your  Samsung Galaxy Note 9  is pop out the S-Pen and start scribbling on the screen. At least, that’s what I did. This is a device that is a lot more fun to use than your regular phones. With the S-Pen, you will start to become the artist you never were, or start to jot down things you never thought necessary.  But, the Note 9 is not just a toy! It is a powerful beast of a phone for power users. And yes, the best phone that money…well, a lot of money can buy right now. But the thing on everyone’s mind is “Is it worth a $1000”? And after full month of usage, I say, yes. Yes, it is worth every penny.         Specs Overview:   Display :6.4-inch QHD+ (1440 x 2960) Infinity display with 18.5:9 aspect ratio and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection  Build : Aluminum Frame and Glass Body with IP-68\xa0 Water and Dust Resistance  Processor : Octa-Core Exynos 9810 processor with Mali-G72 MP18 GPU  RAM : 6 GB RAM with 128 GB storage, expandable memory up to 512 GB with microSD  OS : Samsung Experience UI based on Android 8.1 (Oreo)  SIM : Dual SIM (nano + Hybrid slot)  Back Camera : 12 MP primary camera with variable aperture (f/1.5 + f/2.4) and secondary 12 MP telephoto lens with f/2.4 aperture with Optical Image Stabilization and Dual Pixel PDAF  Front Camera : 8 MP front-facing camera f/1.7 aperture and Auto Focus  Security : Fingerprint Sensor, Face Unlock and Iris Scanner  Dimensions : (161.9 × 76.4 × 8.8) mm; Weight: 201 grams  Connectivity : Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, GALILEO, NFC  Battery : 4000 mAh Li-Ion battery  Price in Nepal :  Rs. 109,900  Rs. 95,599   Design   The design of the Galaxy Note 9 is pretty much the same to last year’s Note 8. It is a very  well-crafted  but not much has changed except the placement of the fingerprint sensor, which is now at a more convenient spot. The phone is quite large, and for those with small hands, it’s going to get quite a lot of getting used to. I am just stating what it is, but, if you’re going to get a Galaxy Note device, you shouldn’t complain about the size!   Other than that, nothing much has changed. You still get a headphone jack, which is good. And this is the first Galaxy Note device to have  stereo speakers . It is  IP68 Water and Dust Resistant , but that is not new for Samsung. The glass back looks pretty good, but it catches fingerprints very easily. There’s also the infamous Boxby button on the right, which was pretty much useless, but it’s very easy to mistake it for the volume down button. I don’t know about you guys, but I think Samsung should consider removing that…and by that, I mean the whole Bixby, not just the button.  Overall, the phone is tall, muscular and has got that premium factor to it – a classic Galaxy Note trait!  Display   A  6.4” Quad-HD+ resolution  on a  Super AMOLED display  makes for stunning visuals. The  Infinity display  with  18.5:9 aspect ratio  and sloping edges make everything appear superb! With OLED displays, you get perfect blacks and better colors. So, from pictures, to videos, to texts, everything is vibrant and punchy and colors are very accurate. There is no argument that Samsung’s displays are one of the best. And while everyone is giving their own version of notches to their phones, respect to Samsung for not jumping on the hype train.   The brightness levels are also pretty good, allowing good sunlight legibility overall. However, a small issue is that the edges reflect light and interrupt the display slightly. And this is actually a design trait on all curved Samsung phones. But, you will get used to it after sometime.  Also, you can adjust whether to use the QHD+ resolution or switch to Full HD+. Keeping it in Full HD+ will help you save battery, while the QHD is all about your viewing experiences.  However, the phone doesn’t have the latest Gorilla Glass 6 Protection. Instead, it settles for the Gorilla Glass 5, which works pretty well too! And that is a much needed element, as finding a good tempered glass on a Note 9 is a bit of a problem.  Camera   The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 inherits the same cameras from the Galaxy S9 Plus, with a few tweaks. The dual camera setup at the back combines a  12 MP lens with variable apertures (f/1.5 + f/2.4)  and another  12 MP telephoto zooming lens . The biggest feature, here, is the dual aperture. It lets the camera change depending on the environment to adjust to the amount of light in your surroundings to get good pictures in all kinds of lighting conditions.  The primary lens is able to give you stunning photo quality! It maintains color accuracy, focus, sharpness and the details. The only concern is Samsung uses its Live Focus for the Portrait mode and bokeh mode. And Live Focus really needs to work on its edge detection. Sure, you can manually adjust the background blur too, but this won’t be the best bokeh mode you will see on a smartphone.      Samsung Galaxy Live Focus Portrait Samples   1  of 3                                                The secondary rear camera allows for a  2x Optical Zoom , which means that even if you zoom up to two times, your pictures will still come out as sharp as the original ones. However, lowlight telephoto images do get considerable noise.      Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Back Camera Samples   1  of 9                                                                                                            Both lenses have Optical Image Stabilization  to deal with your shaky hands. The camera is already an excellent one overall .  The additional tweaks you will see is Samsung’s version of the AI cameras. Samsung calls it Scene Optimizer. The scene optimizer can identify about 20 subjects and supposedly, alters settings depending on what you are shooting. But it’s unlikely that you will notice that much of a difference in your photos. But no matter what, you will be getting good photos, and that’s what matters in the end, isn’t it?      Normal Vs Scene Optimizer    1  of 2               Normal mode         AI Scene Optimizer Mode                  Also, the scene optimizer is nothing new or groundbreaking. We’ve seen plenty of cameras with those features. But, this one also has the  Flaw Detection  feature, which comes quite handy. If the photo is ruined in any way, it will warn you about the scenario. For example, if someone blinks, or something disturbs the background, or if the lenses get dirty, the phone will prompt you to take the photo again. Now, this is a good way to make absolutely sure that your moments are captured quite well.  The front camera is an  8 MP shooter , and while we’ve seen pretty heavy front cameras, Samsung does just great with its 8 MP lens. You can also get the bokeh mode on your selfies with Selfie Focus. Also, many Samsung phones don’t have HDR pro feature in front cameras, but this one does. And it lets you take good selfies even in very bright conditions.      Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Selfie Samples   1  of 4                                                          Samsung also likes to fill its camera app with a lot of modes and options. You can also shoot  Super Slow Motion  videos at  960 frames per second @ 720p  resolution. There’s AR Emoji (a gimmick, just like the others), and a lot of filters in the camera itself. It’s one of the best camera apps in the business – with lots of features and still easy enough to use.  The videos on this one are also pretty great. You can record up to  4K videos in 60 fps  with good sound recording too. However, one thing it cannot do is record  4K HDR videos , as the Exynos 9810 chipset doesn’t support HDR video recording. Maybe the Galaxy S10 will support this feature .

It is very handy when you have to take a group selfie and fit everyone in.  Performance  The Galaxy Note 9 features the  Snapdragon 845 in US and China , and the  Exynos 9810 in other regions . Now, it is true that the Exynos 9810 is faster than the Snapdragon counterpart . \xa0So, the chip is very fast and  delivers super performance  in almost everything – from multi-tasking to gaming. You can play high-end games like Fortnite and PUBG in Ultra settings and get no lags whatsoever. Everything you throw at it, the phone can handle it. Even playing those games with the Power Saver mode on didn’t get any lags or stutters. That should give you an idea of its prowess.  Samsung may not have the fastest chip in the industry as the latest iPhones manage to get the highest Geekbench scores, but that doesn’t matter as long as it runs everything flawlessly and smoothly. Also, we only have the  6 GB RAM  variant here, in Nepal, and the  8 GB RAM \xa0variant may be a bit faster. But sadly, that is not available here.  The phone also has a  Water Cooling System . However, despite that, the phone does heat up considerably. While playing PUBG at Ultra Settings, the phone reached very close to  40-degree centigrade . That is normal for regular phones, but for something with a Water Cooler inside, it is concerning.  The  F ingerprint Scanner  at the back is a tad-bit slower than in other phones, which is pretty much noticeable. The Face Recognition and the IRIS Scanner face similar traits. And it won’t work very accurately in the dark either.  Also read: Samsung Mobile Price in Nepal  Software wise, the Galaxy Note 9 comes with  Android 8.1 Oreo  with  Samsung Experience UI  on top. Now, this UI is pretty refined and is much better optimized than the old TouchWiz. This UI has helpful cues to navigate the deep and seemingly complex operating system as well. And yes, there are plenty of Samsung bloat-ware you can’t let go, but we’ve all learnt to ignore them anyway. One thing I could do without is Bixby. It’s not as good as Google Assistant, and never will be. Which is why, I say, they should remove the whole thing.

And while it will last you the whole day on your Full HD+ display settings, you might be looking for the charger by the end of the day in QHD+ display mode .  I did expect more life from the battery, but maybe because the display is big and the phone has so many features, it didn’t live to my expectations. The  Fast Charge 2.0  can charge your phone in  about 1 hour 45 minutes , which is fast, but, not as fast as the Oneplus 6.  It’s battery saver mode can help extend battery life considerably. There’s also this  Maximum Power Saving  mode that can also extend your battery life by a day and half, but it tones down the display to HD+, disables biometric and also turns the phone dark. This feature will come handy when you’re away on a trip or so.  As for storage, the Note 9 has 2 options:  128 GB , which is the baseline model, and a whopping  512 GB  that also has 8 GB RAM. Both these models have a microSD card slot which can support up to 512 GB. Now, the concept of being able to get a massive 1 TB storage on your phone is intriguing, but that option is not available in Nepal. Even so, 128 GB is ample storage space, don’t you think?  S-Pen   A Galaxy Note 9 review wouldn’t be complete without talking about the S-Pen. The S-Pen is what makes the Note 9 a Note device! And with the added  Bluetooth Remote Control  feature, there’s quite a lot you can do with it .  Sketching and writing notes aside, the remote control function comes handy sometimes. But for the most part, its use feels forced in everyday life.  You can use the remote control to  open the camera , and  take pictures , which is the most you’ll use it for. It can also be used to scroll up or down in the web browsers. You can use it to  play or pause media , or use it during Power Point presentations, too, and some others. But these things aren’t exactly difficult with your hand either.  However, the  Air View feature \xa0in the S-Pen proves to be useful. When you take the pen out, you get quite a lot of options, which, by default are limited to Samsung’s own, but you can add or remove them according to preference.  Apart from letting you create and view your notes, there’s the  Smart Select  feature which can help you select require elements from the screen and use it as per your needs. The  Translate  function can help translate texts on the phone to many languages. There’s also this  Live Message  feature which can help create interesting doodled messages, but that’s too gimmicky, and hasn’t got much usage. Besides that, if you want some childhood nostalgia, you can also paint some pictures with the  Coloring  option.  Samsung DeX  The Samsung Dex, which enables you to use your phone as a desktop, is very much improved.\xa0Samsung has simplified the DeX experience in the Note 9. Now, you can get this “PC like experience” a lot easily, with just the HDMI to USB-C adapter. No need to get the Dex pod or anything else. Simply connect the cable, and you’re good to go!  Conclusion and Verdict  So, to conclude, the Galaxy Note 9, as I already said, is, right now, the best phone money can buy. Unfortunately, you will have to spend quite a lot of it, if you want this device.  The specs are top-notch. The design and build is close to perfection. Samsung displays are the best. The cameras need some more improvements, while the biometrics could have been a tad faster. A truckload of storage is another good point. This is a phone that offers you everything, and then some. And it will carry you easily for the next 2 or 3 years.  However, is there a reason not to get the Note 9? Actually, yes. This phone, no matter how many features it has, still lacks a “wow” factor. This is particularly more noticeable if you have a  Galaxy Note 8  or  Galaxy S9 Plus . If you’re coming from those phones, then, this phone will not provide you anything new. It is not worth a $1000 or Rs.110000.   But if you’re using anything below that, like the S7 Edge or Galaxy Note 5, then, this phone will appeal to you. It has a lot of improvements over those, and a lot of power. The ideal user for this kind of phone is someone who wants the best of everything and at their fingertips. You get a phone, a PC or a TV in your pocket, and if you’re a devout S-Pen user, that’s a bonus. You’re not likely to get anything better, until maybe the next Pixel arrives, or the S10 probably .   But it all depends on you. If you absolutely want everything that it offers right now, then, go for it. But, if you can do without an S-Pen, or all those bells and whistles, or on a budget, there are quite a lot of great options available.  Pros:   Top-notch specs  Stunning AMOLED QHD+ display  Bigger battery  S-Pen Remote  Great camera with Flaw Detection mechanism   Cons:   Very few innovations over Note 8 or S9 Plus  Old design to the Note 8  Camera’s Live Focus is not comparable to the Portrait mode  More bells and whistles than actual improvements']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review.jpg']
['Xiaomi holds its first official event in Nepal; Launches four new phones'],"['Android', 'Xiaomi']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['September 23, 2018']",2018-09-23 15:18:10+00:00,"['Xiaomi is officially here in Nepal, and the company held its first event today. It shared its plans and strategies from here onwards and also launched four new devices.  The  Xiaomi Mi A2 ,  Mi A2 Lite ,  Redmi 6  and  Redmi 6A , are the company’s new mid-rangers of various price ranges that were unveiled today. All these devices enter the saturated mid-range mobile phone market looking to emulate the success of their predecessor but with quite a competitive pricing.  From the event, we got to know that Xiaomi has opened an office here in Nepal to control the selling, and marketing of the Xiaomi phones and products. Beforehand, two different distributors had the sole authority to sell the company’s devices here.        With the new business model and strategies, we can expect Xiaomi to focus more on the customers by providing high-grade devices at a cheaper price tag. And we got to see the first demo of those strategies through the new smartphones.   We got to interview Mr. Sanket Agrawal and Mr. Saurabh Kothari, officials from Xiaomi, regarding the company’s arrival in Nepal and their future plans. They stated on how the company follows the customer-first model and how they will do the same here starting with the four new Mi and Redmi devices.  The officials also stated that Xiaomi will now be more aggressive with the pricing and is working to bring in new devices according to the needs of the customers. And for those waiting for the Poco F1, well the device is launching soon, probably after Dashain  Here are the four new devices that were launched today:  Xiaomi Mi A2   The Xiaomi Mi A2 is the direct successor to the widely popular  Mi A1 . The A-series of Xiaomi comes under Google’s Android One project out of the box. This device is 5.99-inch tall and has an 18:9 aspect ratio. It features a metallic unibody design with a vertical camera compartment. The  dual rear cameras  measure 12- and 20-megapixel and are capable of capturing 4K videos. On the front sits a 20-megapixel selfie camera.  The Xiaomi Mi A2 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset and has 4 GB of RAM. It has a 3,000 mAh battery that is supported with Quick Charge. However, it lacks the headphone jack due to its slim design.  Also Read:  Xiaomi launches MI A2 and MI A2 Lite in Nepal  Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite   The Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite, like its name suggests, is the lite variant of the Mi A2. Unlike the Mi A2, this device has followed the trend of sporting a notch on the  IPS LCD display  that is 5.84-inch tall. It has a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor aided by 3 or 4 GB of RAM which has 64 and 32 GB storage respectively.  On the optics front, this device comes with dual 12- and 5-megapixel cameras. There is a 5-megapixel selfie shooter on the front. Like the Mi A2 and the older Mi A1, this smartphone is also an Android One device. It has a large 4,000 mAh battery with no fast charging technology.  Xiaomi Redmi 6 and Redmi 6A   The Xiaomi Redmi 6 and Redmi 6A are the cheapest phones launched today by Xiaomi. Both the devices come with a 5.45-inch HD+ IPS LCD display. The Redmi 6 is powered by the MediaTek Helio P22 chipset whereas the Redmi 6A has the MediaTek Helio A22 chipset. Both the devices have a 3000 mAh battery.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 is more expensive among the two and features a dual camera setup. It has more storage than the Redmi 6 and comes with 3 and 4 GB of RAM.  The Redmi 6A is the successor to the  Redmi 5A  and the  Redmi 4A . It is the cheapest device launched today. This device has a single 13-megapixel rear camera with a 5-megapixel selfie camera.  Also Read:  Xiaomi Redmi 6 and Redmi 6A launched in Nepal  Xiaomi Mi A2, Mi A2 Lite, Redmi 6 & Redmi 6A Price in Nepal  The Xiaomi Mi A2 was expected to be priced above Rs. 35,000. However, Xiaomi has priced the 4 GB + 64 GB variant at Rs. 30,999. Likewise, the 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage variant of the Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite is priced at Rs. 20,999. The higher-end 4 GB and 64 GB version will sell for Rs. 24,499.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6’s 32 GB and 64 GB variants are priced at Rs. 16,499 and Rs, 18,499, respectively. The cheapest of the devices launched today, the Redmi 6A will be priced at Rs. 12,999. All these devices will go on sale starting 30th September 2018.  Verdict  For a couple of years now, the Nepali consumers have asked for well-performing smartphones in a cheaper price tag. But that has not been the case for a long time. Even the smartphones that are available for cheap in the international market come at a costlier price. Due to the profit margins, the marketing and business model for selling products, and tax, the prices of phones skyrocket.  However, Xiaomi looks to change all of that with its new business model. A lot of Nepali customers had expected the Chinese giants to take this step in the past. But better late than never right?  According to Xiaomi Nepal, the company will receive only 5% profit margin on its devices just to make the price competitive. This is the perfect example of a company thinking only about the customers.  Today’s event was an example of how Xiaomi is going to do its selling here in Nepal. And it has definitely set an example for other smartphone companies in terms of pricing!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/xiaomi-mi-a2-lite-redmi-6-6a.jpg']

['Xiaomi MI A2 and A2 Lite launched in Nepal with Stock Android and Dual camera setup'],['Xiaomi'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['September 23, 2018']",2018-09-23 07:40:07+00:00,"['MI Nepal recently organized an event in Kathmandu. In the event, the Chinese tech giant unveiled four of its products for Nepal. Among the four, two of them are  Xiaomi MI A2  and  Xiaomi MI A2 Lite . Both of them come with the stock version of Android in them and dual camera setup at the back. But how good are the smartphones in terms of specs? Let’s find out here.  Xiaomi MI A2 Overview  Last year’s  Xiaomi MI A1  was a huge hit, not only in Nepal but also in the global market. Xiaomi smartphones are often criticized for its heavily customized MIUI. And in the Xiaomi MI A1, the brand ditched its beloved UI and adopted the pure or the unadulterated stock Android. Since Xiaomi smartphones are always feature-packed, the inclusion of the stock Android in the MI A1 added an extra aspect to love the handset. Continuing with the stock Android, Xiaomi had brought the successor the MI A2, which was launched a couple of months back in the global market. Better late than never, Xiaomi brought this handset finally in Nepal after two months of its launch in the global market.  The smartphone looks sleek and slim with a mere thickness of 7.3mm. It is also light in terms of weight as it weighs just 168 grams. On the display front, Xiaomi has provided a 5.99-inch LTPS LCD display, which is said to have better color accuracy and viewing angles than the mainstream IPS display. This display is shielded by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the top for the protection. On the resolution side, Xiaomi MI A2 features Full-HD+ resolution in an 18:9 aspect ratio and with the pixel density of 403 PPI. So the content on the display can be expected to look sharp and crisp.         As mentioned earlier, the phone features stock Android since the device is the product of the Android One program. It originally comes with Android Oreo (v8.1) out of the box but will receive all the regular updates and software patches from Google for two years.  On the performance front, the MI A2 got a substantial upgrade. The phone comes with the  Snapdragon 660 chipset  over the Snapdragon 625 on its predecessor. It comes coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. But unlike its predecessor, the MI A2 does not have a micro SD card slot for the memory expansion. So users have to be satisfied only with the internal memory of the phone.  The camera was the standout feature on the MI A1. And by looking at the specs, MI A2 seems to possess similar trait when looked into its specs. The phone features a dual camera at the back, which is a combination of 20MP and 12MP sensors. Both of the cameras feature f/1.8 aperture. In terms of the selfie, MI A2 embraced a 20MP shooter on the front. The selfie shooter also has soft LED alongside in order to capture images even in the low light settings.   Most of the specs in the MI A2 look appealing. However, there are also some aspects, where the smartphone disappoints quite heavily. The phone features a small 3000mAh battery and there is no 3.5mm headphone as well. Not to forget, there is no SD card slot either.

But in 2018, the brand produced two smartphones under the Android One program. And  Xiaomi MI A2 Lite  is the second Android One phone of Xiaomi this year after the MI A2. And as the name cues, the MI A2 Lite is cheaper among the two when it comes to price.   In the smartphone market flooded with the notched display, MI A2 Lite is the Xiaomi’s take on providing a notched display on the Android one phone. The phone features a 5.84-inch IPS display with a narrow notch on the top. The similar also comes with Full-HD+ resolution in a 19:9 aspect ratio packing 432 pixels in every inch.  Since the Xiaomi MI A2 Lite is also an Android One phone, it also comes with a stock Android version of Android lacking all sorts of bloatware.

The handset comes with the Snapdragon 625 chipset backed by 3/4GB RAM and 32GB/64GB of onboard storage. There is also a facility to expand the storage further up to 256GB via SD card. And a dedicated SD card slot has been provided for that very purpose. In terms of camera, there is a dual camera setup residing meticulously on the back. The combination of 12MP and 5MP sensors is said to be capable of capturing excellent portrait images. On the selfie front, there is a 5MP front shooter, which comes with f/2.0 aperture.   Despite being low on price, the A2 Lite is better than the A2 in terms of battery. Xiaomi MI A2 Lite can surely provide a prolonged battery backup with its humongous 4000mAh battery.

And while the other phones took the spotlight quite easily, the X8 kinda went under the radar. Now, the reason behind that could be Meizu X8 employs a notch on the display, while others don’t. And this is a bigger issue because Meizu was all about that no-notch displays since the beginning.  But now, the mid-ranger device, Meizu X8 carries the infamous notch on its display.

Even with its massive popularity among people from different parts of life, the company has been failing to make sales. The various market strategies it had in place for the Hero 6 didn’t work as the company failed to achieve profit margins. However, it’s looking to change all of that with its new product – the GoPro Hero 7.  GoPro Hero 7 Specifications  The major talking point about the GoPro Hero 7 is definitely the HyperSmooth stabilization feature which makes sure you get the smoothest of videos even without a gimbal. GoPro has demoed this feature on a video, and it looks quite interesting, to say the least.         The GoPro Hero 7 is available in three different variants, and the numer features you get definitely increases with the increasing price. The higher-end version of the three, the Hero 7 Black, has all the features crammed into one. The 12-megapixel camera of this device can record 4K videos at 60fps. It has the HyperSmooth video feature and you can even live stream your video content directly to your Facebook page. This Hero 7 variant also captures HDR contents.  The Hero 7 Silver lacks a few features the Black version possesses. It is able to shoot 4K videos at 30fps with the 10-megapixel camera. It doesn’t have the HyperSmooth stabilization, so you definitely have to pay to play! The Silver also lacks live streaming service and comes with WDR instead of HDR.  \xa0   The GoPro Hero White is cheapest among the bunch and lacks GPS and WDR in addition to the live streaming feature and HyperSmooth video feature. Its 10-megapixel camera is only capable of capturing full HD videos at 60fps.  All three of the devices are water resistant for up to 10m and have the voice control feature as well.  GoPro Hero 7 Price  The GoPro Hero 7, as I mentioned before comes in three different variants. The highest-end variant, the Hero 7 Black, goes on sale for $400 while the Silver sells for $300 and the low-end Hero 7 White will run for $200. It will go on sale internationally starting September 27 th  and the USA will receive it starting September 30 th .  With all the features at its helm, the GoPro Hero 7 is definitely an interesting action camera. It has a lot of features which could definitely uplift GoPro.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/gopro-hero-7-price-specs.jpg']

['Dell G7 Gaming Laptop Review: Cuts to the Core'],"['Dell', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['September 19, 2018']",2018-09-19 13:29:56+00:00,"['When  Dell  did away with its entry-level Inspiron gaming laptop line and introduced the\xa0 Dell G-series laptops , we didn’t know what to expect. However, we’ve come to expect nothing but close to best, if not the best from Dell laptops. And with the  Dell G7 , it introduces something that is all about the core performance!   Design  The Dell G7 has a fresh design of its own. And while we were in a sea of those plain silver or black or black and red colors, it provides a new look to your laptop with its two colors:  White & Blue  and  Black & Blue  versions. While the White and Blue looks stunning and seems to be everyone’s hot favorite, we decided to go with the Black & Blue version. It might not look equally good, but it’s a nice one, nonetheless.         The aesthetics of the laptop give you a “gaming” vibe. With sharp edges all around and vents at the back which looks like the hood of a sports car, it has a sporty design overall. It is built out of plastic but is quite durable. It is also bulky due to the  large fans  at the back that blow out hot air. But the large fans do a good job of keeping your laptop cool. It is also considerably heavy at  2.6 kg . However, it’s still portable, but you might have problems carrying it around all day long.  Display  The display is where the laptop falls short. It has a  15.6” Full HD (1920 x 1080) display  panel. The quality is pretty decent, but you will notice it is missing something. It has a  60 Hz refresh rate , but, you can also over-clock it up to a 100 Hz. However, that has to be at your own risk, as it has a chance of damaging your screen in the long run. Also, the color reproduction is just okay. It can reproduce only  73% standard RGB  and about  56% Adobe RGB color space . The numbers are disappointing, and gameplay is also somewhat affected. But even so, it won’t make that much of a difference as you’ll be too busy shooting down enemies to notice such subtle differences.  Also, the brightness level on this laptop is also not that commendable. It can get  250 nits of peak brightness levels,\xa0 which are admittedly,\xa0quite low for multimedia viewing. But it is good enough for gaming. Also, gamers kinda tend to play a lot of games at night, and low brightness levels is kinda just right for them. It’s almost as if every part of this laptop seems to be made for gaming.   Another thing that is off-putting is the huge bezels around the sides. Even with a large form factor, the screen doesn’t appear as big as it is. The 15.6-inch screen is definitely big, but with the large bezels, the screen appears small and is also quite distracting. So, your movie experiences might not be good enough. Overall, the display seems to be intended for gamers, and if you’re looking for something to create content like a lot of video editing, or designing, this one is not for you.  Performance  In terms of hardware, the laptop has an  8 th -gen Intel i7-8750 6-core processor  with  clock speeds of up to 4.1 GHz  with Turbo Boosting. Now, this one is a very capable processor, and there is no doubt about its performance. It is supported by  8 GB of RAM , which is good enough for everything else, but you might want to consider expanding it to 16 GB for a sweet gaming experience. The standard model does come with a 16 GB configuration, but the one we got only had 8 GB of it. With only 8 GB, there will be some stutters with heavy games. You can  also expand this to 32 GB , but I don’t think that is really necessary.   But the worst part about upgrading the RAM is that it has  two slots with two 4 GB RAMs , and if you want to upgrade it, you either have to get a new 16 GB unit or replace both of them with 8 GB units.  As for graphics, you get a 6 GB NVidia GTX 1060 Max-Q, which is a respectable graphics card. It gives you  better performance than the 1050Ti  but falls short from the regular GTX 1060. Maybe they could have fit in a regular GTX 1060, but I actually have no complaints about this whatsoever. You can still play all the modern games in Full HD and Ultra settings and still get good frame rates. And the  GTX 1060 Max-Q actually heats less  than the regular 1060, which makes the choice of graphics card a good one!   There’s less thermal throttling, and the laptop doesn’t heat up that much. This is the good thing about those large fans, and they are also quiet enough to let you game without getting annoyed. This laptop also packs enough power to let you use any kind high-end video editing or designing software, but its display is not suitable for such.  Storage and Battery  Now as it is with laptops, there are multiple configuration choices. Our particular unit features an  M.2 256 GB SSD storage . And I don’t know why but in our tests, it was only able to provide  500 MBPS of read and 300 MBPS write speeds  on our tests. Now, these are very disappointing figures from the last generation, as the last ones had really good SSDs with read speeds up to 2800 MBPS and write speeds of 1200 MBPS.  The speed on this one is comparable to that of Dells’ 2 nd  – gen 7567 model’s SSDs. Now, I’m just comparing the speeds with the other SSDs in numbers. You will not actually feel it suffer from slow speeds in normal usage. Actually, you might not even be able to tell the difference, except feeling a tiny bit of sluggishness.   On the battery front, it only has a  56 Watt-hour battery , which is adequate, but for a gaming laptop of this size, it feels small. Looking at its size, it should be able to fit in a larger battery, but it doesn’t. I got around 4 hours of battery life in average usage, which is similar to that of the Inspiron 7577.  Keyboard and Touchpad  The keyboard gives you a good typing feel. It has only 1.4 mm key travel, but it is comfortable enough. The keyboard feels good, but it misses out on the tactile feedback. So, you will find that it’s not as good as some other gaming laptops. It’s got this blue backlight with blue colored fonts, which adds to its cool serene looks. But it also puts a bit of strain in your eyes during prolonged usage, especially at night.   The 4.1 x 3.1 inch trackpad is large and comfortable. And with Windows Precision Drivers, it works much better than other proprietary trackpads. However, its plastic build does affect the precision somewhat in overall usability, sometimes not being able to detect certain gestures like pinch-zoom, three-finger touch, and flick, etc. But it worked most of the time, and for me, it was good enough.  Ports, Audio and Webcam  The large laptop body features all the ports you could want in 2018. You get  three high-speed USB 3.1 Type A ports ,  an HDMI 2.0 port, a headphone jack, a 2-in-1 SD card slot, a Noble-lock security slot , and a  Gigabit Ethernet RJ-45 port . This laptop even features a  USB-C port with Thunderbolt 3 support , and it’s actually a pretty nice feature to have.   The speaker audio quality is above average. The front-facing speakers do a good job of providing you a loud and clear sound. And it can also catch those subtle sounds of footsteps or such while gaming.   However, the  webcam is pretty bad . It captures noisy pictures and videos, and you wouldn’t probably live stream with this webcam. But it is good enough for other social media usage.  Conclusion and Verdict  All in all, the Dell G7 gives you what it advertises, and that is  core performance.  The processor and graphics provide a good gaming experience, even though the RAM is not quite enough. And the worst part about this laptop is the dual RAM channels. This makes upgrading it’s RAM quite expensive, and frankly, a hassle.  Also, the display is not quite good for the multimedia creation or viewing. And the wide bezels add more to its woe. The Dell G7 cut corners with the display mostly, but, I have no complaints on any other aspect. It seems to me that Dell only focused on the gaming performance and didn’t put much emphasis on other aspects, but for the price that I got it for, it actually makes sense.  This unit came from the US directly, so, it  cost around Rs.1,26,000 . But the same model goes for some  145,000 in the Nepali market . Considering the 1,26,000 price tag, this is a good deal, but for 1,45,000, there are some other options you can explore like the MSI’s 8 th  gen offerings or from Acer as well. Overall, The Dell G7 is a good buy for budget-conscious gamers, but I’d recommend you to  get the 16 GB RAM variant  as the 8 GB won’t really be enough and it’s pretty hard to upgrade.  Pros:   Good price to performance ratio  Ample power  Good thermals  Great design and aesthetics  Gaming-centric   Cons:   Average battery life  Average display  Large bezels  Dual RAM slots making upgrading hassles  Heavyweight   Also Read:  Dell Laptops Price in Nepal']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dell-g7-gaming-laptop-review.jpg']

But this time, it’s nothing extraordinary. Just, two new “mid-range” phones added to the Galaxy J-series. This time, the newbies are the  Samsung Galaxy J4 Plus  and the  Samsung Galaxy J6 Plus . It is already confusing with Samsung pumping out so many devices. And these two, with their modest specs are the same – bringing nothing new to the table.  But anyways the two phones are now official. Both the\xa0 phones have a  6.0″ HD+ IPS LCD  screen. Note that it’s only  HD+ (720 x 1480 ) resolution , and the “Plus” means only larger screens, but the display resolution remains pretty much the same. Also, both the phones have a  3300 mAh battery .         The Galaxy J6 Plus features a Dual camera setup at the back. A  13 MP primary shooter  and an  5 MP depth sensor . Something new about this phone is that it has a  fingerprint sensor on the side . Under the hood, the phone runs on an underwhelming  Snapdragon 425 . It is available in two memory options:  3 GB RAM with 32 GB storage  and  4 GB RAM with 64 GB storage . I know, I know, a Snapdragon 425? Yes, it very much seems that way.

This phone is also available in two memory options:  2 GB RAM / 16 GB storage , and  3 GB RAM / 32 GB storage .  The prices aren’t official yet, as the launch date is set to September 25. But there’s a Dutch site that has listed the Duos version of the J4 Plus and the J6 Plus. They are priced as  189 Euros  and  239 Euros , respectively, which converts to some  $220 and $280 . And with smartphones like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro coming soon for similar price, these phones look like a bad bargain!  These “Plus” models offer nothing new except a slightly larger screen and bigger batteries. The J6 Plus does have a side mounted fingerprint sensor and dual cameras, but with such underwhelming processors, it just doesn’t seem enough. I don’t know when Samsung will start listening to us, but until then, we can all agree that Samsung’s mid-range phones are among the worse ones out there.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/samsung-galaxy-j4-plus-j6-plus-featured.png']

And all of that is getting better than ever with the plans Daraz has in stores. Now you may have a question on whether or not the company will change its name to Alibaba. Well, no. Not right now. However, Daraz Nepal is now developing some interesting systems and work plans alongside the Chinese company. It presented those plans in the Daraz Seller Summit 2018 held on 17 th  September 2018. At the event, over 650 Daraz seller and media personnel were introduced with quite a few strategies which will probably map Daraz Nepal’s future.  Read More:  Alibaba Group Acquires Daraz  Well first things first, Daraz is handing over the tools of its system to the sellers themselves en route to make the customer service better. And for that, Daraz will be using a three-step approach. The first step is to hand over the tool itself so that the sellers will sell the products themselves. They will also be able to create new campaign themselves and interact with their customers themselves.         The second step involves maintaining the quality and controlling the whole service transaction by the company itself. And the final step comprises of building a “seamless and foolproof Business Process”.  This new system will go online on the 29 th  of this month. According to Daraz, it will change the whole landscape of online shopping. Speaking at the event, Bjarke Mikkelsen, CEO of Daraz group said, “ Sellers are the heart of Daraz’s e-commerce ecosystem. Making it easy for small-and-medium-sized businesses to do business anywhere is our primary mission. ”  He later added, “ We believe that the best person to sell a product or a service is the seller himself – not Daraz. That’s why we want to give the sellers all the tools to do this independently. Our job is to build the tools and the control systems to ensure that the customer is always 100% protected in every single transaction .”  Another major announcement of the event was the coming together of the company and Nabil Bank. According to Anil Keshary Shah, CEO of Nabil Bank, the bank will now provide SME Loan to the Daraz Sellers and will be partnering with Daraz for the digital payment system.  Daraz Nepal also launched a new service called Daraz Express. This venture has introduced Daraz Hub for a faster delivery, products’ easy drop-offs, customers return and pickups.  Time and again, Daraz Nepal has introduced various offers and campaigns to its customers. And it will now be bigger than ever by the looks of it. In addition to the  Black Friday ,  Dashain Dhamaka  and  Mobile Week  campaigns among others, the company will introduce 11:11 sale offer on 11 th  of November.

But still, that hasn’t stopped companies to come out with more tablets and upgrading their previous tablets. And so, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5″ gets a 2018 version. While the international markets got it about a few weeks ago, it has also made it’s way to Nepal.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5 is a big tablet – well, of course, its name gives it away. The  10.5″ IPS LCD display  is not stunning, but good enough, nonetheless. It has a  Full HD+ resolution (1200 x 1920)  with a\xa0 pixel density of 216 PPI . That is actually nowhere near enough for a display that size, but as I said, tablets are kind of another market. For 2018, the bezels are still big.  It has a polycarbonate body, and design-wise doesn’t win any points. However, it back feels polished and textured, which feels really nice. It has got  4 speakers on the top and the bottom , which might be the best part about this tablet, really. It features an  8 MP camera  on the back with f/1.9 aperture and a  5 MP camera up front . Cameras on this thing are pretty tablet-ish, nothing special about them, just regular cameras.         Under the hood, it is powered by a low-range  Snapdragon 450 chipset  and supported by  3 GB of RAM . Now, I feel like this isn’t enough power at all, for a tablet and it’s price, but that’s what we get. Also, there’s  32 GB of internal storage , which is expandable up to 512 GB with a microSD card. This tablet runs on Android 8.1 with Samsung Experience 9.5 UI on top. Also, it gets 4G LTE support as well. It has got a large battery of  7300 mAh , and can take up to 3 hours to fully charge.  It’s priced internationally at about  $450 , and it costs  Rs.54,490 in Nepal . The pricing is actually appropriate for what it costs around the world, considering it costs about  30000 in India . But with all that it packs, the price seems a bit too much everywhere.  First, I don’t understand why this doesn’t pack enough power. I mean, it’s easier to play games on a tablet, so, why not a more powerful chip on it? Looking at the hefty price to features ratio, you can see why tablets are a dwindling market. However, this thing is big, and with 4 speakers, it is a good entertainment package for consuming media. And it is now here in Nepal as well.  Specs Overview | Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5 2018   Display : 10.5″ IPS LCD Full HD+ (1200 x 1920) with 216 PPI and 16:10 aspect ratio  Processor : Snapdragon 450  RAM : 3 GB  Storage : 32 GB (expandable up to 512 GB with microSD)  Cameras : 8 MP primary + 5 MP front  Battery : 7300 mAh  OS : Android 8.1 Oreo with Samsung Experience 9.5  Price : Rs.54490   So, what do you think about this tablet?

['Samsung Galaxy A8 Star launched in Nepal with FullView display and Dual camera setup'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['September 13, 2018']",2018-09-13 17:06:37+00:00,"['Samsung has created its own Galaxy with a number of J-Series, A-series, and S-series smartphones. And this time, to expand its already vast Galaxy, the tech titan had added a star, namely known as  Samsung Galaxy A8 star . The smartphone was launched in the international market a short time ago. And in around two weeks, Samsung Nepal brought the smartphone here in Nepal.  Samsung Galaxy A8 Star Overview  On the display front, the handset comes with the tall 6.3-inch FullView display. As it is the Samsung’s product, the smartphone has got the Super AMOLED treat. So, one can view the contents in the screen enjoying deeper blacks and brighter whites. This display, which is already bright, vibrant, and immersive also comes the “Always On display” feature. So, there won’t be any hassle of unlocking the phone or clicking the power button every now and then to check the time or to view the notifications.  Looking at the past, Samsung had fairly disappointed the users with the inclusion of mediocre chipsets on its mid-range handsets.  Samsung Galaxy A6 ,  Galaxy A6+ , and  Galaxy J8  are the good examples to present here. But this Samsung has shown really remarkable generosity and has added the  Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset . The chipset is coupled with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage for better performance. There is also an SD card slot, which may come handy to the users, who are not satisfied with the internal storage provided on the phone. Users can expand their storage up to 400GB using an SD card. However, the SD card will occupy the SIM 2 slot so you can only insert a SIM card when the SD card is onboard.         When it comes to the camera, Samsung always strives to provide capable cameras on its smartphones. And the A8 star does not seem like an exception. The Samsung Galaxy A8 star boasts a  dual camera setup  at the back. The camera pair on the phone encompasses a 24MP shooter backed by a 16MP sensor. Both the lenses have an aperture of f/1.7 to provide better performance even on the low light settings. And since there are two cameras present on the phone, users can take Portrait shots with Bokeh effects as well. And the interesting thing is that there is a feature to adjust the focus area and blur intensity before and even after capturing the images.   Even on the front side, Samsung has not made a compromise. The Korean giant has included a 24MP sensor, which comes with a lens of f/2.0 aperture. Although the phone does not have multiple cameras on the front, users can still take portrait selfies. The phone is capable of doing so because of its software intelligence.  If you ask about the device’s battery, I will say that the smartphone is rich with 3700mAh battery. With this battery and specs configuration, the A8 star can easily give two-days backup on the normal use. On the top of that, the handset has a fast charging feature, which helps the device to replenish its battery really fast. On the software front, the smartphone comes with Android Oreo (v8.0) out of the box with Experience UI on the top. And talking about the price, this whole package costs Rs. 59,990 on the purchase.  Also Read:  Samsung Mobiles Price in Nepal  Samsung Galaxy A8 Star Specifications   Display : 6.3-inch Super AMOLED display  Resolution : 1080 x 2220 pixels @ 392 PPI pixel density & 18.5:9 ratio  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 660  CPU : Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Kryo 260 & 4×1.8 GHz Kryo 260)  GPU : Adreno 512  OS : Android 8.0 (Oreo) with Samsung Experience 9.0 UI on the top  RAM : 6GB  Storage : 64 GB (expandable up to 400 GB, Uses SIM 2 slot)  Rear Camera : Dual- (24 MP, f/1.7, CAF) + (16 MP, f/1.7, PDAF), LED flash  Front Camera : 24 MP, f/2.0 aperture  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:\xa0 Dual Hybrid SIM with 4G  Battery : Non-removable Li-Ion 3700 mAh battery, supports fast charging (9V, 1.67A)  Price:  59,990   Verdict  The smartphone does come with appealing design, capable processor and remarkable cameras. But when looked into its price, the handset can suffer competition with its own\xa0 Samsung Galaxy A8+  smartphone. The Galaxy A8+ has a good processor, dust and water resistant body (IP68 certified), remarkable setup of cameras with dual camera setup on the front, and the fancy FullView Super AMOLED display. And talking about the price, the Galaxy A8+ comes with the price tag of Rs. 54,990. So that can be tough to make a choice.   If you can add Rs. 10,000 more, you can get the company’s last year flagship, the  Galaxy S8 . Since it is a flagship phone, you can enjoy its fancy features and shouldn’t have to worry just because it is a year old device.   There is also the  OnePlus 5 (8/128GB)  available at Rs. 58,500 and  OnePlus 5T (6/64GB)  at Rs. 64,900. So, if you can manage the price, they are still a good phone despite being a year old at the age.  Well, that’s not the only competition, the A8 star will be facing. There is  Huawei Nova 3 , which comes with quad camera setup; two on the back and two up front. The phone also features Kirin 970, which is the company’s last year flagship chipset.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/samsung-galaxy-a8-star-nepal-launched.jpg']

The latter offers an  in-display\xa0fingerprint sensor  and will cost you somewhat a premium amount. The Vivo V11 does not support any new features like that, but is still a really nice smartphone and can easily compete with the likes of  Huawei Nova 3i  or the  Oppo F9 .  Overview:  The Vivo V11 features a 6.3″ IPS display with a resolution of 1080 x 2280 pixels. Sadly this one doesn’t feature the much-hyped in-display fingerprint sensor.

The Vivo V11 Pro comes with a 6.41″ inch 1080 x 2340 pixels AMOLED display with an in-display fingerprint sensor.

Speculations were being made on how the CEO of a trillion dollar company could tweet something he was supposed to message. But to everyone’s surprise, this was all part of Apple’s plan to catch everyone’s attention for the event that was starting several minutes later.   At the event held in the Steve Jobs Theatre, Apple unveiled four new products yesterday – the Apple Watch Series 4 and three iPhones.        Apple Watch Series 4 Specifications  Apple Watch has been around for some time, and it’s turning out to be one of the most popular smartwatches. And the Californian company released a new variant of the device yesterday which comes with a few upgrades out of the box.   The smartwatch has a bigger 30% display that has a few new interfaces to choose from according to a user’s choice. It has also undergone a slight design change with the display and the finishing looking more refined than before. In terms of battery, the device provides a similar battery life like its predecessor.   The Series 4 now comes with a speaker that’s 50% louder and has a Ceramic and Sapphire back. This step will now help radiowaves pass through easily from the top and the bottom, making the networking side of things better.  However, the major new feature that this device comes with is that it can measure Electrocardiogram through the digital dial on the side. This is the first consumer electronic that provides this service over the counter.  Apple Watch Series 4 Price and Availability  The new variant of the Apple Watch will be available for pre-order starting tomorrow, i.e. September 14. The base model with GPS will run for $399 whereas the cellular version is priced at $499.  iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR  The major talking point of the event was definitely the new iPhones. Apple released new smartphones yesterday, three new iPhones to be precise. Two of those, the iPhone XS and XS Max, are the direct successor to the  iPhone X  while the XR is ‘comparatively’ a cheaper model.   The iPhone XS and XS Max (whoever came with this name!) don’t have that many differences except for the display and battery size. The XS has a 5.8-inch Super Retina display with 2436 x 1125 pixels resolution while its maxed out sibling sports a tall 6.5-inch Super Retina display that has 1242 x 2688 pixels resolution.   Now there aren’t that many major upgrades the  iPhone XS  has over the X. According to Apple, its new flagship has 60% greater dynamic range in the display and provides a richer stereo sound with a better Face ID. The display now has 120Hz touch-sensing rate for better touch detection and the batteries are slightly bigger. And you can now change the depth of field of an image from the gallery itself. These devices will support dual SIM cards (Nano + eSIM) as well.  However, the major difference lies in the internals. The new iPhones (all three of them) are powered by Apple’s Hexa-core A12 Bionic chip which is the industry’s first  7nm  chipset. This CPU is coupled with an octa-core Neural Engine that will aid in machine learning and various operations. Apple claims that the new phones will be much faster with all the features at the helm. The Neural system also helps in recognizing the scenes of a picture and applying the necessary effect, something we have already seen on quite a lot of devices.  The iPhone X is available in a variety of colors.  The iPhone XR is Apple’s take on a cheaper iPhone, although you could definitely classify it as an expensive smartphone. The device comes with a 6.1-inch LCD display that has a lower 828 x 1792 pixels resolution which is definitely a bummer if you take its price for consideration. The XR won’t even feature Apple’s 3D touch and it is IP67 rated against the IP68 certification of the XS and XS Max.

And Nepali smartphone enthusiasts were not an exception. We were frequently asked about the launch and availability of the phone in Nepal on our social media accounts. It was its appealing specs and the budget price tag, which made it the focal point of attention at that time. However, the wait for the Nepali customers has finally been over. After so much of anticipation, the interested ones can finally lay their hands on the  Nokia X6 AKA Nokia 6.1 plus .  Nokia 6.1 Plus AKA\xa0 Nokia X6 Specs Overview  On the display front, Nokia X6 sports a 5.8-inch IPS panel. The screen features Full-HD+ resolution flaunting a 19:9 aspect ratio. With the pixel density of 435PPI, the content on the screen looks sharp. And on the top, the display has been shielded with the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 to evade the vulnerabilities of cracks and scratches during the falls. The handset also has a small notch on the top and it is the first Nokia phone to put a cutout on the display. With so much brand going after the trend of the notch, Nokia 6.1 Plus might have been irresistible in that respect.         For a smooth performance on the phone, the smartphone has been provided with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset alike the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI . This fairly capable chipset is backed by an ample 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. And talking about the storage, users will also have a privilege to expand the internal memory on their will. Using an SD card slot, users can expand the device’s memory up to 256GB. However, the memory card will occupy the SIM2.  On the optics department, the handset enjoys  dual camera setup  at the back and a single selfie camera on the front. The camera duo on the back comprises of 16MP primary sensor backed by a 5MP depth sensor. The secondary sensor or the depth sensor comes into action while taking portrait shots. With this setup, we can expect it to produce some excellent photos. Also, there is an inclusion of  EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization)  to avoid shakes and vibrations in the videos. Talking about the front camera, there is a 16MP selfie shooter, which comes with a f/2.0 aperture.   In terms of OS, the phone boots on Android Oreo (v8.1). Since the phone possesses the stock version of Android users can fairly enjoy the absence of bloatware. On the top, the phone will get all the timely software updates and security patch. When we look into the sensors, we can feel the generosity of Nokia. The handset is equipped with all the basic sensors like fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, and compass sensors. The phone has 3060 mAh battery to fuel the processes inside the phone, which also supports Quick Charge 3.0 for the fast charging.

DxOMark , a website that tests DSLRs, lens and smartphone cameras have ranked the Note 9 in the second position with  103 points , right below Huawei’s triple camera beast  P20 Pro . For reference, Huawei’s flagship received a score of 109, the highest in any smartphone camera as of now.  The  HTC U12+  also shares the same scores as the Note 9. Although the scores for both smartphones is 103, HTC has an upper hand in video whereas the Note 9 excels in Photography. Following these three smartphone cameras is  Huawei P20  with 102 points and finally the  Galaxy S9 Plus , which makes it’s way to the top 5 with a score of 99.

Looking at Samsung’s\xa0history of putting some of the best cameras on smartphones, it’s no surprise that the Note 9 got such a huge score. Let’s look at the specs of the camera before going in-depth on its strengths and weaknesses.  Specs of Samsung Galaxy Note 9’s camera   Dual cameras  Primary: 12MP (1/2.55-inch sensor, dual-pixel\xa0PDAF, f/1.5-2.4 variable-aperture lens)  Secondary: 12 MP (f/2.4 lens, 1/3.6-inch sensor, AF)  OIS\xa0on both cameras  Single LED flash  4K video at 30/60 fps   Still Photography  Starting off with still photos, the Note 9 has really good autofocusing capabilities. The camera does really well with noise reduction, the zoom quality is excellent and the bokeh effects are pretty realistic. According to\xa0DxOMark’s review of the smartphone, the Note 9’s camera was the best they had tested under good lighting conditions.

It’s capable of capturing high contrast scenes with deep shadows and bright highlights. The images itself are also bright, vivid with accurate white balance and good color rendering. Noise levels\xa0are also minimum with a good balance between noise and texture with “a tendency to smooth fine details a little more than some rivals” – DxOMark.  The second camera’s 2x zoom factor shows good levels of details with a realistic bokeh mode, under outdoor and indoor lightings. Below is a list of all the scores that the Galaxy Note 9 got in every aspect:  Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Photography      Aspects  Score    Exposure and Contrast  91    Colour  81    Autofocus  96    Texture  68    Noise  76    Artifacts  67    Flash  90    Zoom  66    Bokeh  55      Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Videography  Samsung Galaxy Note 9 scores a very respectable 94 in their video tests.

With a fast and accurate autofocus, a wide dynamic range, convincing bokeh, low noise reduction, and vivid & vibrant colors the Note 9’s cameras are hard to beat. But with inconsistent white balance with flash, details that get lost in dark, haloing, ghosting and loss of visible sharpness, the Note 9 falls slightly short of the title, ” the best camera on a smartphone”.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Galaxy-Note-9-dual-camera.jpg']

Be it a gadget, clothing, furniture, the price drop always encourages the consumers to push their budget. And this time, the smartphone to receive the price drop is none other than the  Samsung Galaxy J6 . The smartphone was quite liked by the Nepali customers so the phone created quite a buzz in the Nepali smartphone market. Now that fan-loved smartphone has just been cheaper. Just a day before Teej, Samsung announced this price drop in its Facebook Page. So if you were waiting to buy the Samsung Galaxy J6, this time, you have been quite lucky.   The  Samsung Galaxy J6  enjoys a 5.6-inch Super AMOLED, which features an HD+ (720 x 1480 pixels) display. The display comes in an 18.5:9 aspect ratio and bezels around the display is slightly narrower than the conventional smartphones. Because of these features, Samsung likes to call it an infinity display.        On the performance front, there is an Exynos 7870 chipset from which Samsung never gets fed up. There is also 3/4GB RAM and 32/64GB of onboard storage coupled to it. On the top, there is a dedicated SD card slot, which gives a privilege for the memory expansion without sacrificing the SIM 2 slot.   Talking about the camera, the Galaxy J6 does not have a fancy  dual camera setup  like many of the smartphones in the same price segment. However, it has a decent 13MP single camera, which performance is somewhat on par or better than its competitors. On the front, there is an 8MP sensor, which shoots some appealing and social media ready selfies. The selfie shooter is accompanied by an LED flash. So you don’t have to panic to take selfies in the dark environment or in the low light settings.  On the sensor side, the J6 possesses a rear-mounted Fingerprint sensor, accelerometer, and proximity sensor. Like more of the budget and mid-range Samsung phones, it too does not have an ambient light sensor and a gyro sensor. As the ambient light sensor is absent on the phone, the users have to adjust the brightness level manually when moving from one light setting to another. And because of the absence of the gyro sensor, you cannot watch the VR content on this smartphones. That’s quite a downside.   When looked into the software, the smartphone welcomes the users with an Android Oreo in the first boot. The OS has been spiced up in the Samsung’s flavor with the Experience UI. A 3000mAh battery has also been provided to fuel the entire processes inside the phone.

['Huawei Nova 3 Review: Pretty Close to a Home Run'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['September 9, 2018']",2018-09-09 11:51:26+00:00,"['The  Huawei Nova 3  and  Nova 3i  are both getting a good response from the market. Both these phones feature a FullView display and four cameras. While the Nova 3i is the successor to last year’s Nova 2i, the Nova 3 is Huawei’s take on the premium mid-rangers. By this time, you might already be familiar with what they offer. But let us dive down to the depths and find out if the Nova 3 is really worth the money.   Specs Overview:   6.3-inch (1080 x\xa02340 pixels) 18:9\xa0FullView 2.5D curved glass display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection  Octa-Core HiSilicon Kirin 970 processor with Mali G72 MP12 GPU  6 GB RAM with 64 GB storage, expandable memory up to 256GB with microSD  EMUI 8.2 based on Android 8.1 (Oreo)  Dual SIM (nano + Hybrid SIM)  16 MP primary camera and secondary 24 MP monochrome camera with f/1.8 aperture, PDAF and AI capabilities  24 MP front-facing camera and 2 MP depth sensor with f/2.0 aperture with HD Pro  Fingerprint Sensor and IR Face Unlock  Dimensions: (157×73.7×7.3) mm; Weight: 166 grams  Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, NFC (PAR-LX1 model)  3750 mAh Li-Po battery  Price in Nepal: Rs. 59,999 (US$520)   Design         The glass back feels very nice on the hands. It is slippery, but the 3D curved design with the metal frame counters the slipperiness, making it easy to hold. However, I’ve had my fair share of the phone falling on my face, so, as much as I didn’t want to, I had to put a case on it. Also, the back, being glass, will attract a lot of finger smudges, and hence, you won’t go wrong with a case here too.  Also, this phone still has the headphone jack, which is a very good thing, as the P20 Pro didn’t have one.   Overall, the Nova 3 has a small form factor and is aesthetically as well as visually pleasing. I’m sure you will agree that the design really is one of the best things about this phone.  Display  On the display front, the  6.3” FullView Display  with minimum bezels looks pretty good. Yes, there is the infamous notch, but considering it houses two cameras, an IR sensor and speaker, it’s actually pretty small, unlike those of the Xiaomi Mi 8! Still, apps aren’t optimized to embrace the notch, so, that kind of gets in the way of your viewing experience.   Like most other phones, you can turn it off, too. However, that doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. The notch is small, but, due to that very reason, the LED notification rests behind the speaker grill. And at most times, it is not even visible when you get notifications. It totally defeats the purpose of those LED lights!   The  IPS LCD display  with  Full HD+ resolution  portrays vivid and sharp colors – for both texts and pictures. With an  aspect ratio of 19.5:9  and  pixel density of 409 PPI , everything on the screen appears pleasing to the eye. Brightness levels are good enough to allow good sunlight legibility too.  I would’ve liked the phone to have the Always-On display feature, as the Face ID can be quite annoying at times when you only want to look at the time. It is really fast, and if you just want to glance at the time, it will unlock immediately, and you have to go that “extra mile” of having to lock it before putting back in your pocket.  Overall, the Nova 3 features a great display. Sure, it cannot outshine the flagships of 2018, but it gets pretty close!  Cameras  The Nova series is known for the quad camera setup. The dual camera setup at the back consists of a  16 MP primary sensor  with Phase-Detection Auto Focus and a  24 MP monochrome sensor , both with  f/1.8 aperture .   \xa0  And yes, it lacks a depth sensor on the back, but the bokeh effects on this phone come out quite good. You can tell by just look at the images – sharp edges and good amount of blur on the background. However, in low lighting conditions, it’s edge detection seems to be a bit off, and you get quite the amount of noise. Also, auto-focus is a bit slow in low light, and gets some motion blur.      Monochrome Samples   1  of 2                                      But, if you are taking pictures of low-lit places, the HDR effect comes into play, and tries very hard to get a good picture. However, considering all factors, it’s safe to say that most low-light images won’t be very appealing.      Back Camera Samples   1  of 5                                                                    The Nova 3 also flaunts  the AI camera , which you can turn on or off, that can distinguish between various elements, and change the picture accordingly. It can distinguish between over 20 different things, and while it does help out in certain scenarios, amping up color levels and HDRs; it’s more of a hit and miss. Mostly, it  over-saturates  greens, yellows and reds, so, sceneries come out unnatural, with more brighter colors than there really is. However, food photography will look very appealing for the same reason. But again, if you’re taking overlay shots, for example, the weather or sky or clouds, they will come out very pleasing to look at. It actually comes down to preference whether you prefer natural colors or ones that please you visually.      Normal Vs AI    1  of 4               AI OFF         AI ON         AI OFF         AI ON                        The  24 MP + 2 MP front camera  takes outstanding selfies. The 2 MP depth sensor helps produce quite good portrait selfies, and the  HDR Pro feature  will also allow you to take good pictures even with bright/sunny backgrounds.      Front Camera Samples   1  of 2                                      There’s also a beauty mode on it, and it does a good job of hiding the blemishes and lightening your face if you use it with the right levels.      Normal VS Beauty   1  of 2               Normal         Beauty                  The rear camera can record  4K videos @60fps  while the front can record 1080p videos at the same frame rate. Videos are decent in daylight with good audio recording as well. You can also shoot  short bursts of 480 fps Slo-Mo  videos, but the quality is strictly average.  However, the  lack of any kind of Image Stabilization  in these cameras is a downer. And this is more annoying in videos! They shake quite a bit and the slightest bit of movement can spoil your video moments. At this price, Huawei could at least have implemented EIS, but it didn’t, which is a shame!  And there’s the AR Lens as well, with various effects for your photos and videos. You can definitely have some fun with it when you’re bored, but other than that…there’s not much to it. It’s there for entertainment purposes, and that’s it, a gimmick I’d say.  Overall, cameras on the Huawei Nova 3 are great, but the major factor that holds it back is the lack of Image Stabilization in them.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Performance  The Nova 3 features Huawei’s own  Kirin 970 chipset , which you get on Huawei’s flagship, the P20 Pro. Couple that with  6 GB of RAM , and you get a speedy device with zero lags and stutters! Everything works like a breeze. Multi-tasking goes on without a hitch, and I experienced no lags while gaming. I played a lot of Asphalt 9, which seemed to run without a single stutter! Heavy games like Injustice 2 runs smooth as well.  The phone does heat up fairly quick, though. In my experience, the temperature maxed out at 38.7 centigrade during some PUBG session in HD graphics and High frame rates. While there can be some thermal throttling, I think that’s actually normal with many phones.And since the Nova series have also received the GPU Turbo update, the gaming experience is a very good one.  The phone runs on  Android 8.1 with EMUI 8.2 . Like all other skins, it comes with some bloatware and pre-installed apps too. while the pre-installed apps can be rid of, bloatware stays. The EMUI skin will also need some getting used to. And there are also some customization options for you to choose from.      Huawei Nova 3i Software UI   1  of 8                                                                                                  Storage and Battery  The Nova 3 has  128 GB internal storage . While there’s also a  microSD card slot  which uses the SIM 2 slot, 128 GB of memory should be more than enough for everything you want to store in it.   Just like other phones in this price bracket, the Nova 3 has a large battery of  3750 mAh , with  Fast Charge feature . The battery lasts the whole day easily with sessions of gaming, videos, casual web-surfing and everything. The fast charge helps fully charge your phone in under 2 hours, but it is not as fast as OnePlus’ Dash Charge.  Conclusion and Verdict  I have no complaints on the Nova 3 in terms of design, performance, and battery. Both the fingerprint sensor and Facial Recognition is very fast. However, the display needs to be optimized for the notch and cameras would have been better if they could’ve added Image Stabilization. The AI still needs work, too, but it is a good camera, though.  The Huawei Nova 3, overall, seems to be a good phone. Since there aren’t many phones in the 50000 – 60000 price bracket, you might not exactly know what to expect. If you want something better, you have to add quite a lot of cash, for instance, the OnePlus 6. The phone  costs Rs.59900 , which is fair enough, considering it costs Rs.35000 in India. So, for that price, I think Huawei Nova 3 justifies its worth.  All in all, the Nova 3 has its share of shortcomings, but there are things that make it a worthy purchase. In the end, I would say that it is pretty close to a Home Run!  Pros:   Stunning design  Good cameras  Powerful processor  Good display with small notch   Cons:   Apps not optimized for notch  No Image Stabilization  Quickly heating up during gaming']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/huawei-nova-3-review.jpg']

The event will be happening in New York this time around, and of course, the company will be live during the event, if you want to see it.        However, there is very less excitement this time as the Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL have leaked (actually, rained down even) like crazy. It seems to me that we know almost everything there is to know about the Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL. However, a part of me is hoping that all those leaks will just be fakes, and the phone will actually feature something new in the event. I mean, it’s Google. I kinda don’t believe that the company let so much of its phone get leaked like haywire!  Whatever it is, the phone is sure to have a  Snapdragon 845 , a  single rear camera  and  Qi wireless charging . We’ll just wait if the other leaks are legit enough. I know, we’ve already seen enough, but I am still crossing my fingers.  Also, Google might also unveil a refreshed version of the  Pixelbook , new  Pixel Buds , and Google’s own  Smart Display . However, we might not be able to see the much rumored Pixel Watch at the event.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pixel-3-launch-date.jpg']
['Vivo X23 Launched with In-display fingerprint sensor and tiny notch'],['Vivo'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['September 8, 2018']",2018-09-08 08:57:50+00:00,"['After only 5 months of the unveiling of the  Vivo X21 , the Chinese smartphone brand launched the Vivo X23 in Chinese markets! The Vivo X21 was one of the first smartphones to feature the  In-display fingerprint sensor , and but the X23 combines that with a smaller notch. I, however, don’t know why everyone is making a big deal out of this “small notch”. The  Essential PH-1  did it first, but nobody’s talking about it.  Anyway, the Vivo X23 comes with a large  6.41″ Super AMOLED display  with  Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2340) . As aforementioned, the display also embeds a Fingerprint sensor and a tiny notch at the top. It also seems to have slimmed down the chin too. Vivo seems to be constantly taking bigger steps towards that “All-screen” module.         The Vivo X23 has a dual camera setup at the back, which consists of a  12 MP primary sensor  with f/1.8 aperture and a  13 MP ultra-wide-angle lens  with f/2.4 aperture. The little notch on the front houses a  12 MP selfie camera  with f/2.0 aperture. And as it is with Vivo, the cameras pack in all the AI bells and whistles like AI Portrait, AI Beauty, etc.  Under the hood, the Vivo X23 runs on the new  Snapdragon 670 chipset  with  8 GB of RAM . Now, that should be enough for quite a power-packed performance. But, the phone also features something called  Dual Turbo Acceleration Engine  for improved performance. As for the software, the phone runs on  Android 8.1 Oreo  with  Vivo’s FunTouch OS 4.5 .\xa0The phone packs a sizable  3400 mAh battery  with 22.5W Fast Charge and has a  128 GB inbuilt storage  option.  VIVO X23 Pricing & Availability  It is available in 3 color options: Phantom Purple, Phantom Red, and Midnight Blue. The phone has a  price of around 3500 Chinese Yuan , which converts to $511. There are also special variants of the phone with giant Vivo logos on the back in two different colors, Fashion Orange and Fashion Purple. The phone is already available for reservation in China, and will start shipping on September 14th. However, there is no word on international availability yet.

['Honor launches its mid-range Honor 8X in Nepal'],['Huawei'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['September 8, 2018']",2018-09-08 08:27:11+00:00,"['Compared to other smartphone brands, Honor is still is a new name in the Nepalese market and their range of offerings is not that big. One of the Honor devices that has actually landed in Nepal is the Honor 8X. However, since its successor has already landed in Nepal, will it be a good choice to go with Honor 8X given its price tag?  Honor 8X Overview  Internationally, the Honor 8X was launched alongside its bigger sibling the Honor 8X Max. These two devices come with pretty huge displays, equally big batteries, a nice set of specs.  Design and Display  The Honor 8X comes with a 6.5-inch display with a resolution of 1080×2340 pixels> The aspect ration here is the trendy 19.5:9 aspect ratio display. The display has a notch at its top which houses the 16MP front camera. As the other devices in this price range mostly come with a water-drop or dewdrop styled notch, the notch on this one does look out of place.        On the back, we get the usual gradient colors with shiny finish as with other Honor devices. There is a capacitive fingerprint sensor o the back. The two-camera are arranged vertically with an LED flash just below them  Processor and Memory  It gets the Kirin 710 processor that we saw on the  Nova 3i.  It is a processor based on the 12nm process and it is paired with the Mali-G51 MP4 GPU. The smartphone will be available in either 64GB/128GB version with 6GB of RAM or a cheaper 64GB storage with 4GB of RAM. However, only the 6/64GB and 4/64GB memory configurations are available in Nepal. You can expand the internal storage via the dedicated microSD card slot included in the smartphone.  Camera  The Honor 8X features a 20MP f/1.8 aperture lens guided by another 2MP depth sensor. The secondary camera adds background blur to your portrait shots. Sadly the cameras cap out at 1080p@30fps for video recording. The selfie camera included is a 16MP f/2.0 lens with, again, 1080p@30fps video recording.  Battery and Others  The device comes with a battery of 3,750 capacity. Honor has disappointed by not including support for any fast charging technology. For connectivity, the device supports WiFi 802.11 ac and Bluetooth 4.2. There is a capacitive fingerprint sensor mounted on the rear panel for biometrics.   Honor 8X Max Overview  The Honor 8X Max, on the other hand, is a mammoth of a smartphone. With a 7.12-inch\xa01080 x 2244 pixel 18.7:9 ratio display, the device is quite large. The phone sizes in at\xa0177.6 x 86.3 x 8.1 mm, and you get a 5000mAh battery inside. The smaller version has a 3750mAh unit.  The Honor 8X Max comes in two versions, one with the  Snapdragon 636 SoC  and 4GB of RAM, and the other with a  Snapdragon 660  with 6GB of RAM. The cameras receive a downgrade on this model, with a 16MP + 2MP sensor at the back and an 8MP selfie camera at the front.  Both smartphones run on Android 8.1 Oreo with EMUI 8.2 on top. The Honor 8X supports up to 10W charging whereas the 8X Max supports up to 18W fast charging. Seeing how big the battery is on the bigger version, the 18W fast charging does make sense.  Honor 8X Specifications   Display:\xa0 6.5-inches IPS LCD panel; Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection  Resolution:  Full-HD+ ( 1080 x 2340 pixels); 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Chipset:  HiSilicon Kirin 710; 12nm Mobile Platform  CPU: \xa0Octa-core (4×2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU: \xa0Mali G51 MP4  RAM:  4/6GB  Storage:  64/128GB (expandable up to 512GB)  Software & UI:  Android 8.1 (Oreo) with Huawei’s EMUI 9.0 on top  Rear Camera: – 20MP f/1.8 primary sensor, – 2MP depth sensor  Front Camera:  16MP, f/2.0 aperture (motorized)  Fingerprint sensor:\xa0 Physical (rear-mounted)  Connectivity:  WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, AGPS/GPS/GLONASS/BDS, USB micro USB 2.0, 3.5mm headphone jack  Battery:  3,750 mAh battery with 10W Charging  Colors:  Black, Blue, Red, Pink   Huawei Honor 8X Price in Nepal and Availability  Only the Honor 8X is available in Nepal and that too, in two memory configurations – 4/64GB and 4/128GB. The price of Honor 8X in Nepal is  Rs. 21,999  for the  4/64GB  variant and Rs.  30,500  for a  4/128GB  variant.

The  Redmi Note 8  provides more value for money than the 4/64GB variant. Even if you are in love with Honor’s design,  Honor 9X (6/128)  looks more promising with updated specs than the Honor 8X (4/128GB).

But they do not compromise on power and cooling, as far as we know. With that piece of information out of the way, if you can justify the high price tags of these laptops, you are in for some satisfying gaming sessions. The new releases include both the 17 inch R5 and 15-inch R4 versions, both available through online seller SastoDeal.  Dell Alienware 17 R5  The Dell Alienware 17 R5 is the biggest Alienware, if not the biggest laptop out there. Featuring a 17-inch QHD (2560×1440) TN display with a refresh rate of 120Hz. The same is capable of up to 400nits of brightness and Nvidia G-Sync support with Tobii Eye-Tracking. The display is also pretty color accurate covering 110% of the sRGB color spectrum.  Pushing the highly demanding display are a pair of Core i9-8950HK processor and a GTX 1080 GPU. This mobile version of the CPU is also capable of overclocking, up to\xa05GHz to be exact. The GTX 1080 also comes with a standard 8GB GDDR5X memory, making this laptop a very very capable one at gaming.        All this paired with a 16GB DDR4 RAM at 2666MHz, which should provide easy expansion as it’s a 1x16GB setup. It also comes with a pretty ample 512GB of PCIe M.2 Class 50 SSD and a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive.

The processor made it’s way to smartphones priced all the way to  $1000 , all the way from\xa0 $300 . The SoC made its way to almost every flagship that might be worth buying, and largely so as it was a very capable processor. Although now, the SoC is almost a year old, so it’s only fair we get excited about the next flagship processor from Qualcomm, most probably the Snapdragon 855.   Geekbench scores reveal a certain processor with a single-core score of 3697 (4200 on the  iPhone X ) and multicore scores of 10469, on par with  Apple’s A11 bionic SoC . Again, these scores barely compete with the capabilities of last year’s iPhone chip. We are also due for a new iPhone update, most probably the iPhone Xs and more importantly the new A12 chip, which should be far better than it’s predecessor.         This isn’t a surprising news since Apple has always been better at SoCs. Nonetheless, we still aren’t sure that this is the SD855’s benchmark scores, it’s just highly probable. All we know is the “msmnile” tagline, with 8 cores, and a base frequency of 1.78GHz running on a 6GB RAM, Android 9 based smartphone setup. We also know that the SoC will also be manufactured on the new  7nm FinFET architecture  and feature the new Snapdragon X50 5G modem.

Where did the V10 go…no one knows, but let’s not dwell on that. However, the  V11 Pro  is here, and it is already official in most markets. And this is actually the cheapest phone to features the  In-Display fingerprint sensor ! This mid-ranger phone also comes with a Waterdrop display and a large AMOLED screen.   The Vivo V11 features a large  6.41″ Super AMOLED panel  with  Full HD+ resolution , which is pretty impressive for a mid-range device. It is also protected by  Corning Gorilla Glass 6  and has a very small notch. The smartphone features the same cameras as of the Vivo X21 and Vivo NexS flagships. That dual camera setup consists of a  12 MP primary sensor with f/1.8 aperture  and a  5 MP secondary sensor with f/2.4 aperture . The  front camera is a 25 MP selfie shooter  with AI enhancements…which are kinda mandatory in 2018!         Under the hood, the V11 Pro runs on the  Snapdragon 660 chipset , supported by  6 GB of RAM . Now, that means it has a  2.2 GHz Octa-core CPU  and the  Adreno 512 GPU . The  internal storage rests at 128 GB , but if that’s not enough, you can always expand it via a microSD card. And another good thing about this is that, you won’t have to sacrifice your second SIM slot for that.   This phone also features Facial recognition, which Vivo calls  Face Access . And for a phone that managed to fit an in-display fingerprint sensor, the Face Access should be fast. However, the in-display fingerprint technology is not as fast as a regular fingerprint scanner, but the difference might be negligible. It sports a considerable  3400 mAh battery , but looking at its large AMOLED display, I think it is a bit small. Also, just like other mid-rangers, it  still has a micro-USB  and not a Type-C, but it does have  Quick-Charging support , though.  The Vivo V11 runs on  Android 8.1 Oreo , with its  FunTouch OS 4.5  on top. This new generation UI features something called the  Jovi AI Engine  for allocating CPU and memory resources for efficient usage and battery saving.

Amid all this, Huawei has added another one to the competition, the  Huawei Nova 3i . With this device, you get a very impressive spec sheet but does the device follow similar performance? Let’s find out in our Huawei Nova 3i review.    6.3-inch (2340 x 1080 pixels) Full HD+ 19:5:9 2.5D curved glass display  Octa-Core Kirin 710 (4×2.2GHz Cortex-A73 + 4×1.7GHz Cortex-A53) CPU  Mali-G51\xa0MP4 GPU  4GB RAM with 128GB storage, expandable memory up to 256GB with microSD  Android 8.1 (Oreo) with EMUI 8.2  Hybrid Dual SIM (nano + nano / microSD)  16MP rear camera with LED flash, secondary 2MP rear camera  24MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture, secondary 2MP camera  Dimensions: 157.6×75.2×7.6mm; Weight: 169g  Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock  Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, GPS + GLONASS  3340mAh battery  Price: Rs. 38990 (in Nepal)   Design  At sight, you get a premium look all over. If you look at it, there’s the shiny glass back, the rounded edges all of which look stunning. Adding to the pros is that the phone is quite slim and lightweight. Not only that, the metal frame around the edges help you have a good grip on the device. You get the vertical camera placement like the P20 pro and the fingerprint sensor at the back which is easy to reach and indeed is very swift. There is also Facial Unlock that uses the front camera and does a good job.         Downwards, you get a single speaker and micro USB ports and yes, the headphone jack. Well, high-end phones have started removing the headphone jack and it’s a relief to see that midranges are not following the trend.   On hands, the phone is a bit slippery but not to the point of frustration, so no issues. Meanwhile, you’ve got to do something about the smudges. Likewise, I already have a few scratches on the edges at the back so, you will definitely want to case it up.   Display  Talking about the disply, you get a 6.3-inch FHD+ screen with even taller 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The IPS display is sharp and the colors are vibrant. The sunlight visibility is average though. It’s a big screen and for those multimedia-hungry users, you have your device here.   But, as there is no display protection available on the phone, for careless people like me, we need to borrow some help from tempered glasses.  Cameras  Now moving on to the cameras! Like most of the Huawei devices, this too has a quad camera setup, two at the front and two at the back. The back houses dual 16+2 MP cameras and the notch in front carries 24+2 MP sensors.   Pictures from the rear camera are vibrant in terms of colors and they pack in good details. However, the edge detection in the portrait mode needs improvement.

The AI seems to have improved because other than greenery, other things seem to have been enhanced quite properly. Similarly, buildings seem nicer with AI on. But even without AI, the Colors are punchy and vibrant. However, I cannot quite say good things about the night time shots as they were grainy and disappointing. There is 3D Qmoji feature which is entertaining, but it needs a little reworking.

Likewise, there is no option for 4K video recording. So, if you are into mobile vlogging, with this device, you will certainly need steady hands. However, you can shoot 1080p videos at 60 fps which is good news.  Talking about the quality of selfies, you get quite nice ones. Detail- wise, color-wise, the pictures seem quite good. There is an HDR Pro mode that enhances colors. We also have the AI that helps enhance the pictures alongside the beauty mode that smoothens your skin and makes you look fairer.

Well, that’s again your choice. Like the rear camera, the dual cameras at the front do not detect edges properly. All in all, these samples are proof that the selfie cameras function very well. But all in all, I have liked the cameras in this device.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Performance  Now let’s get going with the performance side of things. This device is the first to feature the Kirin 710 processor which in real life is comparable with the SD 660. We have witnessed how good the SD 66O performs in the  Mi A2 , and now we have a similar hero with the 710 in the Nova 3i.  On use, I got lag-free performance every time, whether it be for multitasking or app opening; everything ran smoothly as expected. Memory wise, you get the usual 4 GB RAM but with a very impressive 128 GB onboard storage which can further be expanded through the hybrid SIM slot. With the hybrid SIM slot, you can expand your phone’s memory up to 256 GB but I guess 128 GB will be enough for most.  Now, let’s hear about gaming. Well, with the Nova 2i, we had an average performance in the gaming department. Now, with its successor, I have no room for complaints in this regard. I have played plenty of games in the process of testing this device, namely the Modern Combat 5, my current favorite Asphalt Legends and everybody’s favorite, PUBG along with some others. PUBG ran with slight lags in medium settings while Modern Combat 5 and Asphalt Legends ran smoothly. So, on a whole, I have had a very interesting and impressive gaming experience on this phone.  Software and UI  Software-wise, we get the Android Oreo 8.1 and EMUI 8.2 on top of it. For me, EMUI works just fine except for the onboard bloatware. As I said in the hands-on video, the unnecessary apps and games can be deleted, well most of them can be deleted. Apart from that Huawei gives a lot of customization options in the UI, like changing notch preferences, having an app drawer if you want, changing where the battery percentage shows, power saving options, well there are tons of it. The fact that all these features don’t make the phone slow is a really good thing.      Huawei Nova 3i Software UI   1  of 8                                                                                                  Battery  The 3,340 mAh battery capacity on this device is the same as the Nova 2i but this one has a longer lasting battery. This somewhat is also a result of the energy efficient Kirin 710 processor.   Despite not have fast charging, the phone surprised me by getting charged in 2 hours and some time. Likewise, talking about backup, the 3i lasted more than one day on my use. On a regular basis, my activities include, a bit of gaming, a lot of social media and work stuff and the Nova 3i has helped me get through all that without having to worry. Only, I felt a little disappointed on the device not having USB type C, I mean, it’s become sort of 2018ish having Type C on your phones.  Connectivity  I used this device as a daily driver and call quality on NTC and Ncell both is good. However, it lacks WiFi a/c so connecting to a 5GHz WiFi connection will not be possible. Also, there is a single speaker and the output from it is just average.  Conclusion  So, does the Nova 3i fare for the price being asked? I would say yes!\xa0 I mean there are little aspects that may not look good but overall the phone does well. It’s got this really nice design and a good display, good set of cameras, a very good battery backup and excellent performance with the new Kirin 710. The Nova 2i and 3e were considered weak in the performance front but the 3i seems to have got it covered. The Nova 3i, in my opinion, is a worthy purchase.

['Samsung Galaxy J8 Review: Suited up with fancy cameras'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['September 3, 2018']",2018-09-03 13:28:51+00:00,"['In the recent days, the rise of the Chinese smartphones has quite challenged the Samsung in term of sales. The Chinese brand with their ever-growing affinity to provide capable hardware in the budget handsets and Samsung’s reluctance to refresh the design somewhat backfired Samsung. So to regain its lead, Samsung started providing a refreshed design in its latest smartphones and the  Galaxy J8  is one of such lucky handsets. But how does this gorgeous looking smartphone fares in the real-life usage? Let’s find out in this Samsung Galaxy J8 review.   Samsung Galaxy J8 Specifications   Display:\xa0 6.0-inch Super AMOLED display  Resolution:\xa0 HD+ (720 x 1480 pixels), 18.5:9 ratio, 275 PPI pixel density  Chipset: \xa0Snapdragon 450  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A53  GPU:\xa0 Adreno 506  OS:\xa0 Android Oreo 8.0  RAM:\xa0 4GB  Storage:\xa0 64GB,\xa0expandable storage up to 256GB via SD card (dedicated slot)  Rear Camera:\xa0 Dual cameras: (16 MP, f/1.9) + (5MP, f/1.9), LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0 16MP, f/1.9 with LED flash  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity  SIM:\xa0 Dual SIM with 4G LTE  Battery:\xa0 3,500mAh  Price : Rs. 33,499   Design and Build  The Samsung Galaxy J8 looks good despite its plastic back. There is a metallic frame and the metallic coating on the back that makes it appear premium. Even while holding and during use, the handset gives the impression of a metallic build.         The phone also has curvy edges on the sides, which adds comfort in usage and offers a firm grip. The phone never slipped from my hands during my usage in the entire review period.   What’s unique here is the location of the speaker which is located in a weird place on the right. The audio quality from the speaker is average and it’s not very loud either. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back which is a little bit slow to my liking.  Display  On the front, you get a huge 6-inch display. It’s surrounded by narrow bezels on the top and bottom, but there’s no curved glass on the sides.  Samsung likes to call it “Infinity Display” since it comes with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, but I don’t get this whole Infinity Display concept. I mean, you get the Infinity Display on Galaxy Note 9 and the S9 as well. And you cannot compare the J8’s display to those at all…Maybe Samsung should call the displays on its mid-range phones something else.   Like with every Samsung phones, you get a Super AMOLED panel that has good color reproduction, deeper blacks, and brighter whites. So, I didn’t have any issues related to color accuracy and vibrancy.  However, I was disappointed to find out the resolution to be only HD+. Last year’s  J7 Max ,  J7 Prime , and  J7 pro  featured Full HD display, so I can’t understand why Samsung is including an HD display in 2018.  Since Samsung uses quality panels, I had no issues whatsoever, while watching videos, playing games and surfing the web. To my surprise, I did not notice any pixelation in the display or any lack in sharpness. However, FullHD panel would have served well especially considering the price tag.  The smartphone offers good brightness levels. I had no problems while viewing the contents even on a bright sunny day. Turning the outdoor mode on amplifies the display illumination to a maximum value so I could easily view the display even in a flooded light situation.   However, the absence of the ambient light sensor is another aspect where Samsung likes to compromise. You need to manually adjust the brightness level every now and then and it could be annoying at times. I mean, come on Samsung, the ambient light sensor is not a feature you should skip on a midrange phone.  Software  Software-wise, the Galaxy J8 runs on Android Oreo 8.0 out of the box. \xa0Like always Samsung’s own Experience UI comes with tons of bloatware. I found most of the bloatware flimsy so uninstalling or disabling them was the first thing I did when I got the review unit.  However, I grew quite fond of the S-Health app. Since I don’t have any smartwatch or a fitness tracker to monitor my daily activities, I trusted the S-Health app to monitor the number of steps I walked or the number of calories burned in any given day. It’s not a hardcore exercise regime, but this is good enough.      Samsung Galaxy J8 Software UI   1  of 10                                                                                                                      The inclusion of game launcher, Dual messenger, Blue-light filter, Multi-window feature, Ultra Power Saving and Ultra Data Mode are some other welcome additions in the UI. So, except that cluttered bloatware, I was fairly impressed with the Samsung Experience UI.  I also noticed that all the games installed on the phones stores in the Game launcher Folder. It is an interesting feature as the user can manually make a gaming profile, which gives them an option to mute the notification while playing. In the game launcher, the user will also have the option to play the games by setting the performance to normal or to play the games with the power saving option. And the great thing is that it applies to playing every game inside that folder. Furthermore, while running the games, two special icons add to the navigation bar. Between the two, one locks the gaming screen pausing the game whereas pressing another icon unveils some more features like taking a screenshot of the gaming screen or making a gaming video. I found this feature pretty handy as it allowed me to share the gaming experience with my friends and my siblings.  Camera  Samsung always had the best camera on a midrange smartphone. This time, Samsung has included a  dual camera setup . The camera pair comprises of 16MP primary lens backed by the 5MP depth sensor. The sole purpose of the two cameras on the back is to capture portrait images. So, I tested the portrait images first. And I was thoroughly impressed by its capability. It has an excellent edge detection, due to which, the Bokeh effect looks more natural than what you’d get from software tweaks. And like always, Samsung has also added the feature to adjust the amount of blur and focus area after taking the shots.      samsung galaxy J8 Rear Portrait camera samples   1  of 4                                                          In addition, this time, Samsung has included the feature to change the blurred backdrop from normal to Crystal, Pixel, Time Slice and Crumbled options. I found this feature really handy as it adds new taste in the mainstream Bokeh effect. Furthermore, there is also the Portrait Dolly feature, which basically creates the 3 seconds videos from the portrait images where the subject is zoomed in or zoomed out with the segregated background.  Talking about normal shots, the device captures images with substantial details with a good amount of color reproduction. Even on the HDR side, the smartphone does a fine job. It captures HDR shots preserving the details of the highlights and shadows quite well and I have no complaints here. However, low light shots were not that impressive. They invite quite a lot of noise and grains, so, the images do not look so good. But when compared side by side with a more expensive Nova 3i, the J8 does a better job in low light shots.

The beauty mode also works quite well by removing the facial blemishes and acne.      Selfie: Normal Vs Beauty   1  of 2               Normal Mode         Normal Mode                  But its Selfie Focus is the most exciting feature. With this feature, it captures the portrait selfies with blurred backgrounds. Although it’s not as good as the rear camera since there’s only one camera at the front, and the background blurring is done with software effects, but it looks fine when captured under ample lighting.   As for videos, the J8 captures Full HD videos at 30fps from both the front and the rear cameras. Videos from the phone look okay at best. Since the phone lacks Image Stabilization, captured videos look kinda shaky. Also, the jittery autofocusing is also really unpleasant.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Performance  The J8 is powered by Snapdragon 450 chipset backed by 4GB of RAM. The presence of the mediocre chipset bugged me since Day 1. The chipset is usually found in budget phones these days, and Samsung’s decision to opt for this chipset in a midrange phone is not a good choice at all.  However, since the chipset only has to power an HD+ display, the performance of the phone was not that bad. Using multiple apps and multitasking ran smoothly and there were no lags while switching between them. Even while playing low end to mid end games, there were no any stutters and drop in frame rates. I played Asphalt 9, Dead Trigger 2, and Shadow Gun legends, all of which, ran with good frame rates at medium settings. But at high settings, you will notice every now and then. And, when you compare its performance with say the  Redmi Note 5 AI  or the  Oppo F7 , its evident that the J8 falls short by a good margin.  On the storage side, the J8 packs an ample 64GB inside. Also, you can expand the storage up to 256 GB with a dedicated microSD card slot as well.  Battery  A generous 3500mAh battery coupled with low power consuming hardware and internals, the J8 easily provided me more than a day under normal usage. So during the review period, I was thoroughly impressed by the battery performance. And since there are various power saving options, I could even prolong the backup. So, with the J8 as my daily driver, I never had to bother about charging the handset very often.   Despite that impressive backup, charging was a\xa0pain in the neck. The stock charger of the smartphone is rated 5Volt, 1.5Amp, which takes slightly over three hours to get the battery fully charged. But with the 5Volt, 2Aamp charger, it took just around 2 hours and 15 minutes to refill the battery.  Conclusion  To sum it up, The Galaxy J8 has an impressive camera – both front and back. They’re comparable to those of pricier  Huawei Nova 3i  and  Oppo F9 . The battery is good enough and will easily last you for a day. The build quality is sturdy despite a plastic back while the AMOLED display offers great colors and brightness levels.  However, the choice to put in a Snapdragon 450 is just not right. If they’d gone with the Snapdragon 636, or the Exynos 7885, it would’ve been much better. Also, I think a 1080p display is mandatory for the price of the phone.  With all that it packs, I think the phone is mainly focused for general users who want something of everything. As it doesn’t have anything, in particular, to make it stand out, it is just for the average users, and not for someone who wants power performance. So, that was the Samsung Galaxy J8 review.

The new laptop (ASUS G703GI) runs on a Core i9 at its heart. A full-fledged\xa045W 8th Gen six-core  i9-8950HK  boasting a maximum Turbo frequency of 4.8GHz. The same laptop also comes with a GTX 1080 GPU and costs Rs 531,250.  If the Core i9 or the overclocked GTX 1080 didn’t impress you, well you might as well stop here. The price tag won’t help much either, because we ourselves think it’s an overkill anyway. If you invest the same on a desktop, you can get a far better i7-8700k, a 1080Ti, and a 4k display, all for less money. But at the end of the day, if you want a laptop, I can’t help you.  Either way, the laptop does come with a few other features like 32GB of RAM, 2TB of SSHD and 256GB of NVMe SSD. We also haven’t mentioned the 17.3″ FHD display on board. We hope that it’s the same 144Hz 3ms G-Sync enabled display, which the post fails to mention because if it’s not, this is truly an overpriced piece of a laptop. They are giving away a free gaming backpack, a gaming mouse and a headphone which is a nice touch.

['Xiaomi MI 8 Review: A flagship that plays hard to get'],"['Reviews', 'Xiaomi']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['September 2, 2018']",2018-09-02 13:55:30+00:00,"['Launched in the occasion of Xiaomi’s 8 th  anniversary, the Mi-series did away with Mi 7 and named their flagship  Mi 8 . This flagship landed quite some time some 2 months but unlike many of its phones, it didn’t quite make news headers. Probably because it’s only available in China for some reason. You can buy it online in other parts of the world, though, which is, again, shipped from China. Even so, we got our hands on the Xiaomi Mi 8 and this is our full review of Xiaomi’s latest flagship.   Xiaomi Mi8 Specifications:\xa0   6.21-inch (2248 × 1080 pixels) Full HD+ 18:7:9 AMOLED display, DCI-P3 color gamut  2.8GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 845 64-bit SoC with Adreno 630 GPU  6GB LPDDR4x RAM with 64GB / 128GB\xa0 / 256GB (UFS 2.1) storage  Android 8.1 (Oreo) with MIUI 9, upgradable to MIUI 10  Dual SIM (nano + nano)  12MP rear camera with 26mm wide-angle lens, 1/2.6″ Sony IMX363 sensor, f/1.8 aperture, 1.4µm pixel size, dual-tone LED flash, 4-axis OIS, Optical zoom, 4K video recording, secondary 12MP rear camera with\xa0 Samsung S5K3M3 sensor,\xa0 f/2.4 aperture, 1.0µm pixel size, 2X zoom  20MP front-facing camera with real-time AI portraits  IR Face unlock, Fingerprint sensor  Dimensions:\xa0154.9×74.8x 7.6 mm; Weight:\xa0175g  Dual 4G VoLTE, WiFi 802.11ac dual-band (2×2 MU-MIMO ), Bluetooth 5, Dual-frequency (L1+L5) GPS/GLONASS/Beidou, NFC, USB Type-C  3400mAh\xa0battery with Quick Charge 4+ fast charging (Mi 8)   Design\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0   At first look, you’ll immediately know that it resembles the iPhone X uncannily. It is kinda huge, and not really easy to hold. The phone is light and has curvy edges, which helps the grip somewhat, but for someone with small hands, it’s not going to be easy.         The back is Gorilla Glass 5, and as it is with glass, they’ll attract finger smudges. But, it looks and feels quite premium on the hands, as expected of a flagship. I personally loved the design! The only thing is, it lacks is Water or Dust resistance but I’m not complaining. The phone is priced accordingly. It’s well built, better compared to last year’s Mi 6, has some sturdiness to it, while being a bit light at the same time.        1  of 5                                                                    Display  The Xiaomi Mi 8 decided to go with an AMOLED panel this time from IPS LCD, and this has made a huge difference. I really, really liked the display! The AMOLED panel alone makes it a huge improvement over the Mi 6, but there are also some other improvements.  I am against notches, on screens, but you actually start getting used to these after a time. However, the notch is a bit big, while it only sports one front camera, speakers and an Infra-red sensor. I think Mi could’ve shrunk the notch by a bit, though.  The phone’s screen is big at 6.2 inches and the FHD+ display is pretty good as it is! The resolution does the screen justice. Again, you cannot compare it to Samsung’s flagships or even of Huawei’s but at this device’s price point, this is a good display. However, the brightness is not as satisfactory. In the sunlight, it’s just usable – nothing much.  Another good thing about the display is it’s got an always-on feature, which is quite handy. You can easily get the time and notifications on it, and it’s pretty necessary too, as its Facial recognition is quite zippy and will unlock in a fraction of a second, which is a bit troublesome if all you want is to look at the time. But there’s also an option to turn it off to save battery as well.  Performance  The Mi 8 sports the Snapdragon 845 processor that lives up to its name. With 6 GB of RAM, I have no complaints about its performance. It’s zippy fast, and can handle all the multi-tasking you throw at it. My games like Asphalt 9 or the Dead Trigger 2 didn’t even stutter once! No, I’m not kidding, and it didn’t heat up either. You can feel the rise in temperature, but it’s a lot less than other phones! And with an Adreno 630 GPU, the gaming experience is just great.  However, there were times when the phone heats up for some weird reason. And I wasn’t even gaming on it then. In fact, no heavy applications, but it was heating for a while, though. Maybe that is a software problem, but I can’t really say.  Software and UI  On the software front, it runs on Android 8.1.0 Oreo, with MIUI 9.5 skin on top. As with all Xiaomi phones, it does have bloatware and proprietary apps. You can remove almost all bloatware, so, that won’t really stand in your way. I have always been a stock Android person, so, I found the UI and navigation only okay. But yeah, if you have been using Xiaomi’s phones and used to MIUI, then, you’ll like it.   Storage, Audio, Sensors  The phone is available in three storage options: 64 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB. But since there isn’t an expandable memory option, do choose your storage wisely! It has got good speakers…loud and clear, and better than I was actually expecting. Plugging in earphones developed good sound quality too, and the overall audio experience was good.   The fingerprint sensor at the back is quite fast too. Just a tap at it, and it will open up. The fingerprint sensor and the facial recognition feature seem equally fast to me. And both of these sensors are faster than some other phones I’ve tested.  Camera  The Mi 8 packs a dual camera setup at the back; a 12 MP with f/1.8 aperture and OIS and another, a 12 MP telephoto lens with f/2.4 aperture.   Now, the camera setup is basically the same as that of Xiaomi’s Mi Mix 2S. Nothing new, here. I find the cameras decent. Pictures are sharp and detailed, it maintains color accuracy and usually, photos come out great.

They sometimes tend to be a bit noisy, but overall, pretty usable. HDR mode, however, does take a second to process. Portrait mode does a good job too, with both faces and objects, as edge detection is pretty decent.   The selfie camera has been bumped to a good 20 MP sensor from 8 MP, which is a welcome change. Selfies are detailed with nice skin colors in good lighting conditions. Even with a single lens, it can take pretty great portrait selfies with that background blurring effect we all seem to want so much.      Xiaomi Mi8 Front Camera Samples   1  of 3                                                As for video recording, the Mi 8 can record 1080P and 4K videos @ 30 fps, No 6fps here. The 1080P videos are stabilized and have excellent color, but the 4K videos lack stabilization, so do shoot in 1080P for the best outcome.  Also, you can’t take zoomed in videos very well, as it doesn’t switch to the telephoto lens even in the 2X zoom. Another disappointing factor is the poor audio quality while video recording. Still, whatever videos it takes, it does a great job at it, if you can get around its lack of stabilization in 4K.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Now, the MI 8 has a score of 99 on DxO Mark’s ratings, but I really have mixed feelings about this. Of course, I am not the camera expert here, but compared to Samsung Galaxy S9+, which has about the same score, I feel like the Mi 8’s camera falls behind.  Battery  With a 3400 mAh battery capacity, the battery capacity is quite good on it. In terms of its display size, it’s not that big of a battery, but in my experience, it is quite good actually. I got above 5 hours of screen-on time during my usage, and is comprised of all kinds of intense gaming, surfing my social media and also watching videos. So, I’d say that is pretty good.   The phone boasts that it supports Quick Charge 4.0, but there aren’t any chargers that support that yet. Even Mi 8 itself comes with a Quick Charge 3.0 charger which says it can get your battery from empty to full in about 1 hrs and 40 minutes, and it actually does that. It is still a bit slower than OnePlus 6’s dash charge, so, I would very much like to see it charge with a Quick Charge 4.0.  Verdict  Overall, after some usage of this phone, I can say that this is a flagship material. Sure, it looks like the iPhone X, it did away with the headphone jack and without Water and Dust resistance, it might not be able to compete with some particular flagships out there. But with its price, it will give them a run for their money! I have no complaints about its build, display, speaker, performance, and battery. They’re all excellent. The camera, however, doesn’t live up to my expectations. Also, the absence of the 3.5 mm headphone jack and lack of an expandable storage is a bit of a letdown.  The Xiaomi Mi 8 starts its international pricing at $490, with a minor difference in price in various online sites, probably because you have to ship them in from China. You can get the best deals from Gearbest right now. If it does make its way here to Nepal, and it the price is around 55000 to 60000, I think it would be a great buy! But that still remains to be seen. What are your thoughts on Xiaomi’s latest flagship? Would you buy it if it were to come here? Or do you think there’s better value for your money? Do let us know.  Pros:   Affordable price for a flagship  Good gaming experience and doesn’t heat up that much  Good selfie camera  Great display apart from the notch   Cons:   Large form factor and big notch  Rear camera is not as good as expected  No water or dust resistance']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Xiaomi-Mi-8-review.jpg']
['Huawei AI Cube redefining Smart Home and Geometry'],"['Huawei', 'IFA 2018', 'Router']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['September 2, 2018']",2018-09-02 10:42:01+00:00,"['The IFA 2018 in Berlin showcased a lot of tech – from downright crazy to some innovative ones too. And for Huawei, the exhibition was a perfect arena to unveil it’s Smart Home Speaker. Now, we have plenty of smart speakers, but Huawei sets its smart speaker apart with some aspects, including its name. First, Huawei calls it the  AI Cube . While you may understand a cube as a 3D block of six square sides, Huawei means a cylinder! And that too, with a broader base narrowing as it moves upwards. It actually resembles the  Google Home . But with the smart speaker incorporating the  Alexa digital assistant and a 4G Router , the Huawei AI Cube is redefining Smart Home…and geometry too!   I won’t hold anything against Huawei for naming its smart speaker the AI cube. But it kinda eats me a little. Anyway, the “cube” is powered by Amazon Alexa. So, you can access all that the digital assistant has to offer. And with numerous developers working on Alexa to make it better, I guess it will improve continuously. The Chinese giant doesn’t have its own digital assistant, but maybe, that’s all well. It would take quite a lot for a new digital assistant to compete with the likes of  Google Home ,  Apple’s Home Pod  or other Amazon Echo devices.        The Huawei AI Cube also serves as a 4G router, which is the very feature that sets it apart from the crowd. This smart speaker has an  LTE Cat 6 modem  with an  802.11 ac WiFi adapter  inside, which makes it a pretty good home router. Also, with Huawei’s expertise in making connection devices, I would believe the router is on point.   On the speaker front, the AI cube has four microphones for input but only  a 15W mono speaker . That won’t make for any crazy stereo sound, but with Huawei’s own proprietary tech, Histen, the sound quality should be actually pretty good.  Histen  features things like  virtual bass ,  adaptive gain control , and  linear phase   equalizer , which should make for a pretty good speaker.  Huawei hasn’t revealed any other specs like the battery, nor is there any word on pricing. But the smart speaker is set to  release into European markets at the end of 2018 . It won’t make it to the US, and not even China itself. So, I doubt its availability on Asian markets too. However, the Huawei AI Cube, although not a cube, seems to be a pretty compelling smart speaker.

According to sources, the phones so launching are the Prime models of the  Galaxy J4  and  J6  launched some time back in 2018. So, we may be expecting the Samsung Galaxy J4 Prime and the Galaxy J6 Prime to be launched very soon.  The J4 and J6 featured Samsung’s own Exynos chipsets but the upcoming Prime models is expected to feature processors from  Qualcomm . Similarly, the phones will come with Android Oreo 8.1 out of the box, unlike their predecessors that came with Android Oreo 8.0. News of the devices coming to the market soon has been released on the company’s Vietnamese website.  Sources also reveal that these prime models of the J4 and J6 will most likely be released this fall in Vietnam\xa0and Netherlands before other markets. As far as other specifications go, we are currently unclear about what the devices will be like and how much they will cost.        The Samsung Galaxy J4 featured a 5.5- inch SuperAMOLED display and the  Exynos 7570 chipset.  Similarly, it came with a combination of 2+16 GB storage alongside having a 3,000 mAh battery capacity. In terms of cameras, we had 13 and 5 MP shooters at the back and front respectively. It did not have a fingerprint sensor though!  The Galaxy J6, on the other hand, had a 5.6- inch SuperAMOLED screen with the internals being handled by Samsung’s  Exynos 7870  chipset. It came in two memory variants, 3 or 4 GB with 32 or 64 GB internal storage. Similarly, it came with a similar 3,000 mAh battery like the J4. The cameras were 13 MP shooter at the back and an 8 MP camera at the front. The J6 did come with a fingerprint sensor at the back.   Both the J6 and J4 had average performance when we put it to test. With the prime versions of both the phones, we have put our hopes for better performance.

['JBL Go 2 Review: A Portable Bluetooth Speaker on a budget'],"['Bluetooth Speaker', 'JBL', 'Reviews']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['September 2, 2018']",2018-09-02 08:46:57+00:00,"['Gone are the days when the bulky and high power-devouring speakers used to be installed for amplifying sound. These days, speakers are available in small form factor, which intensifies the sound level to a great extent without major compromises on the sound quality. And adding to the list, there is the JBL Go 2 Speaker, which comes at a portable size and promises a superior audio quality. But how does this device fares in real life? Let’s find out in this review.   JBL Go 2 Specifications   Dimensions : 71.2 x 86.0 x 31.6 (mm)  Weight : 184 grams  Connectivity Options : wireless (Bluetooth), 3.5mm headphone jack  Bluetooth Version:\xa0 Bluetooth 4.1  Controls : activate Bluetooth, power on/off, volume  Battery : Lithium-ion polymer (3.7V, 730mAh)  Recharge Time : 2.5 hours  Battery Backup (Up To) : 5 hours  Frequency Response :\xa0180Hz – 20kHz  Output Power : 3W  Transducer : 1 x 40mm  Signal to Noise ratio :\xa0≥80dB  Protection : Waterproof (IPX7 certified), water resistant up to 3.3 ft  Speaker Channel Type : Mono  Intelligent Assistant Compatible : Google Assistant, Siri  Hands-Free Function : Yes  Audio Amplifier : Integrated  JBL Go 2 Price in Nepal : Rs. 4,500 ( Evostore )   Also Read:\xa0 Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers under Rs. 10000 in Nepal        Build And Design  On the design front, the JBL Go 2 may not look all fancy and eye-catching but it definitely looks sophisticated in its rectangular shape and rounded corners. Wrapped with the rubberized housing and with only the speaker grills on the front, the speaker surely looks sturdy and durable. On the top, the rubberized wrapping with an IPX7 certification also acts as a waterproof jacket, which prevents the speaker from getting damaged or destroyed in the time of drizzle and downpour. So even in this rainy season, I didn’t have to worry about carrying the speaker outdoors to listen to music.   And as you can see, we have the Deep Sea Blue color variant of the speaker as our review unit, which definitely looks stunning. But even if you don’t like this color, you don’t have to worry about. Since the speaker comes in a staggering 12 colors, so you can surely pick one that best represents your tastes.  In its miniature size and with its punchy sound, the speaker looks perfect. It is also light in terms of weight. It just weighs 184 grams, just as heavy as my phone. In addition, it fits perfectly on my palm and carrying around in my pocket haven’t been a problem for me at all. However, there are no any sorts of straps or clips to hang it on the backpack or on the belt loops. I definitely prefer a strap like on the  Bose soundlink micro  or a clip like that on the  JBL Clip 2 . So I did find this absence disappointing since it is not fun to walk around listening to music with a speaker stuffed in a pocket or inside a backpack.   Buttons and Controls  Talking about the buttons, all the buttons on the speaker is placed on the top. And on the right of the speaker is a rubber door that hides the micro USB charging port and 3.5mm auxiliary jack for legacy devices. You could see power button, pairing button, volume rockers, and a multifunctional button aligned meticulously on the top. The multifunctional button works as a playback controller and it can also be employed to access the voice assistant on the phone and managing the phone calls.   The speaker also has a mic embedded to it In order to command the voice assistant and to use it as a speakerphone. However, I was not quite pleased with the performance of the mic as it is not particularly sensitive. And during the review period, I ended up using my phone most of the times to complete the tasks, especially while using the Google Assistant.  Performance  The speaker has a grille on the front through which the sound projects outward. There is also the JBL logo on the grille and right on the top of the logo, you can see a tiny LED indicator, which glows white when the speaker is on. The indicator starts glowing red in the case of low battery and in the time of charging.  On the performance front, I didn’t have much expectations from the Go 2 given its small size. But to our surprise, it turned out to be a great performer when it comes to sound. The speaker filled my room with crisp and balanced sound and my mood with euphoria. The speaker can crank any kind of music, from jingles and tunes to metal and rock songs. The treble and mids sound perfect with absolute frequency response and smooth amplification. However, Bass is just ok. When it comes to bass, the speaker couldn’t produce sufficient beats to rock my room. And Deep bass….. Deep Bass seems to be non-existent as the speaker only amplifies sound from 180Hz frequency onwards.   Also when I tuned the volume up to higher values, I noticed the increase in distortions with the upsurge in volume. The harsh audio output at higher volumes is quite fatiguing. So I don’t suggest amplifying the sound to higher volumes. And since there is just a single speaker facing forward, you won’t be getting any stereo output or a 360-degree sound. The absence of the multidirectional audio can be felt as any shift from the speaker’s path results in the muddier and less intense sound. This had been absolutely displeasing when I played songs through the speaker in a group hangout.   Despite the minor displeasures, I did find the device as a decent speaker for music listening. Not just on listening to music, the device is also a great companion speaker for watching movies and streaming any sorts of video content. I watched a few of the How I met your mother’s episodes and the experience had been legendary. The audio sounded smooth and clear and I didn’t encounter any audio/video syncing problems.  Battery  In terms of battery, the device comes with the 730mAh battery, which provided me four hours of back up when I listened to music with my phone’s and speaker’s volume at maximum. But on the lower volumes, the battery backup tends to increase. I also tried listening to the music at around 60% volume and the battery accompanied me for slightly over six hours. Frankly, I was not satisfied with the backup the battery provided and wished for more. But given the size and price of the speaker, that was understandable.  Verdict  Even in its small stature, the JBL Go 2 packs plenty of punch. With the amplification it provides and the audio quality it delivers, the JBL Go 2 is certainly one of the best portable Bluetooth speakers at its size and price. Yes, the device cannot produce 360-degree audio and battery backup is not so satisfactory. But that’s the compromise you have to make while buying small and inexpensive speakers.   If you are strictly into the audio quality,  Bose Soundlink micro  will be an ideal choice for you. The amplification is amazing and the quality of sound it delivers is really soothing. However, the speaker costs four times more than the JBL Go 2 on the purchase. For a multidirectional sound,  Alloccacoc Audio Cube portable  is a fine choice, which offers 360-degree sound and delivers a punchy 30-watt output. However, the speaker is rather big in size than the JBL Go 2 and is twice as much as expensive.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jbl-go-2-speaker-review.jpg']

And in that eye-catching tech event, Huawei is surely one of the show stoppers. The Chinese tech giant, which has already stunned us with its three-camera setup in the  Huawei P20 Pro  this year has something different on its shelf this time around. This time, the tech titan has showcased its brand new Huawei HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset, which is the world’s first SoC (System-on-Chip) to feature a 7nm architecture. And this is not the only area, where the chipset has pioneered. There are plentiful of sectors, where the SoC flagged to be the first but we will get into that later.  Also Read:  Understanding nanometer (nm) technology  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset  was adopted by most of the Android smartphone manufacturers in the year 2018. And this chipset was better than Huawei’s last year’s chipset HiSilicon Kirin 970. So, Huawei seems earnestly rivaling against the SD845 chipset\xa0this time. And the keynote on the IFA 218 seriously cues that. When the advancement introduced in the chipset is properly acknowledged, one can certainly find its superiority over the SD845.        On the memory front, the Kirin 980 has 20 percent better bandwidth and has 22 percent lower latency when looked side by side with the SD845. This implies that apps can now launch faster and users will not have to experience any sorts of sluggishness. In terms of gaming, the Kirin 980 promises to produce 22 percent higher frame rates than the SD845 but keeping the power consumption level 32 percent lower.  Also Read:  Things to consider while choosing a smartphone SoC  In the photography arena too, the chipset has got some handsome upgrades. The chipset features Dual ISP (Image Signal Processor), making use of which, the chipset delivers 46 percent faster camera processing over its predecessor, maintaining a 23 percent improvement in power efficiency while recording. There is also an improvement in latency by 33 percent.  Since Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used as a buzzword lately in every technological scenario, Huawei has given quite serious attention towards it. The tech giant had already provided the NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for the AI processing in the last year’s Kirin 970 chipset. And this time, Huawei doubled its AI processing aspirations has taken a huge leap by providing dual NPU in its newest chipset. This made the Huawei HiSilicon Kirin 980 chipset the first of its kind to feature Dual NPU inside it. With this setup, the SoC can perform an AI-assisted image recognition at the rate of 4500 images per minute. Huawei also showed that, by the same measure, the Snapdragon 845 could only reach up to 2,371 whereas the Apple’s A11, which enjoys performance leads in other categories, trailing far behind with only 1,458.  You might be interested in:  Understanding smartphone processors’ Cores  In terms of architecture, the Kirin 980 uses a new octa-core architecture (4 x Cortex A-76 + 4 x Cortex A-55) that mixes big, little and medium cores for more efficiency. The two big cores run at 2.6GHz and get triggered when demanding tasks like gaming is on the progress. The two middles cores are clocked at 1.92GHz, which comes into play when less-intensive processes are going on. Browsing, texting, etc. can be taken for an instance. The four little cores, which are clocked at 1.8GHz kicks in when there is not much of a task. These cores are best used for the background processes or playing music since they demand less energy juice.  Also debuting in the new Kirin chipset is\xa0the Mali G76 GPU, which promises 30 percent more efficiency and lets the devices run high-end and graphics-demanding games with maximum fluidity. Also, there is chipset enjoys 1.4Gbps Cat 21 LTE modem, which promises to deliver faster cellular data transfers. In addition, the chipset supports ultra-fast 2133MHz LPDDR4X RAM, which will ensure speedier performance while multitasking. Furthermore, the Kirin 980 will offer the world’s fastest smartphone Wi-Fi speed, clocking in at 1,732Mbps. With this speed, this newbie has surpassed the SD845 by huge margins since the best speed of SD845 is 866Mbps with a Qualcomm modem and 1083Mbps with a third-party modem.

The production of Vespa Electtrica will start this September and will go on sale in Europe in October. However, it will be available in the US and Asia from early 2019.  According to Piaggio, the initial sales will be limited, and later expanded in November to coincide with EICMA 2018, also known as the Milan Motorcycle Show.  Features of Vespa Electtrica         The new Vespa Electtrica has a retro Vespa design similar to the first one released back in 1946. Vespa claims that it has a maximum range of 62 miles (100km) and performance like that of a standard 50cc scooter. It takes about 4 hours for the silent, battery-powered scooter to fully charge. Maintaining the 4hr session charge every time will serve 100 percent of the battery capacity up to 10 years of use.  The top speed of the Vespa Electtrica has not been confirmed. The scooter has an Eco mode which limits the speed to 19mph for battery preservation. The Vespa Electtrica will feature a DC motor having a power of 2 kW (2.7 hp) continuous and 4 kW (5.4 hp) peak power.   The Vespa will also have an advanced AI functions that Piaggio Group is developing for its robot Gita. Piaggio claims that the artificial intelligence system will enable the vehicle to sense potential risks or accidents. It will also be able to recognize their operators and provide an alternate route if there is a bad traffic and use navigation services.  With the AI functions, the scooter can also detect pedestrian and vehicles near a certain radar. It allows the riders to access the digital dashboard, and connect phones with the scooter using Bluetooth.   The Electtrica X, a hybrid version, is also in work. It will have a total range of 124 miles. However, it will have a shorter battery life with the power of 31 miles. And when the battery levels get low, it uses the gas-powered generator.

Staying in the mid-range section, it’s mostly known for its affordability in Nepal. And so, another one in the lower-mid-range category is the  Oppo A3s . Costing about Rs.19,490, this phone is really an affordable option. But is it really worth the price? Find out on our Oppo A3s review.  Latest Price: Rs. 19, 490 (2/16GB) | Rs. 24,590 (3/32GB) [Last updated on December 6, 2018]         Specs Overview:   6.2-inch (1520 x\xa0720 pixels) 18:9\xa0FullView 2.5D curved glass display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection  1.8GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 450 14nm Mobile Platform with Adreno 506 GPU  2GB RAM with 16GB storage, expandable memory up to 256GB with microSD  ColorOS 5.1 based on Android 8.1 (Oreo)  Dual SIM (nano + nano + microSD)  13MP rear camera with LED flash, f/2.2 aperture, secondary 2MP camera with f/2.4 aperture  8MP front-facing camera, f/2.2 aperture,\xa01.12μm pixel size  face unlock  Dimensions: 156.2×75.6×8.2mm; Weight: 168g  Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS +\xa0GLONASS, USB OTG  4230mAh battery   Design and Build  Upon first look, the phone  appears quite attractive . Its big, bright and glossy design catches your eye instantly. It has a  plastic build  but it appears premium due to its glossy finish and sturdy construction.   The glossy finish means it’s prone to finger smudges, but it comes with a soft rubber case in the box. And the phone is big, and quite so, which might be due to its large battery. It sometimes bothers you that you can feel it in your pocket while walking or sitting down. And if you snap on the case, it becomes even bigger!   However, since the phone’s curvy edges give it some grip, it is easy to hold despite it’s size. The location of the speaker is a bummer, though. It’s located in a place where you can very easily muffle it while gaming or watching videos. I had to hold it very awkwardly to prevent muffling the speakers while gaming, which is very unsettling. Also, the lack of a fingerprint sensor is another downer. Plus, there is  no LED notification light , which invites its own set of inconveniences.  On the design front, it has its bright color, glossy design and its sturdy construction going for it which is good enough.  Display  The large  6.2” IPS LCD display  with a  19:9 aspect ratio  looks good too. The  HD+ resolution (720 x 1520)  can produce good vibrancy and accurate colors without much pixilation. It also has good brightness levels allowing you to use your phone quite well in the sun. But for a large screen such as this, I felt like the resolution wasn’t enough. Pictures aren’t that sharp or detailed, but I guess that’s what we get for the price. And if you can get over that, watching multimedia on the large screen is actually fun!   Of course, like every other phone of today, there is a notch. But the  apps are not optimized for the notch experience . If you play games in full screen, it will cut out some parts of it, making it somewhat inconvenient to play. And it’s similar with the videos. You will get an option to watch them in either 16:9 or 19:9 aspect ratios, but choosing the latter intrudes the content quite a bit. If the apps were optimized for the notch, like the OnePlus 6, then, it wouldn’t be as bad. Oppo should consider this in their other upcoming phones.   Cameras  Following the industry trends, Oppo A3s, too, put  dual cameras  at the back. A  13 MP primary sensor with a 2 MP depth sensor\xa0 is what you get\xa0for that Bokeh effect in your pictures. While the phone does a decent job with the portrait mode, its  edge-detection needs some work . It’s not the best depth capture, sometimes, feeling like its more software than the hardware at work. But most times, it will do a good job.   As for regular images, the cameras are capable of capturing good photos in well-lit conditions. There are enough details but colors come out a bit off, and aren’t accurate enough to make it true-to-life. It mostly  over-saturates colors , which sometimes can look pleasant and other times, not so much. And even the  Auto-focus is quite slow , making the objects blurry with even the slightest movement. And as for low-light photos, it’s even worse. Photos get quite muddy with a considerable amount of noise, highlights are blown, shutter speed lags, and a bunch of other issues. The cameras are just not good at all!      OPPO A3s Back Camera Samples   1  of 5                                                                    The  8 MP selfie camera  is also not something to be proud of for Oppo. The selfie camera can take  artificial portrait shots , which is better than expected. Similar to the rear cameras, selfies come out decent in good lighting conditions, but in low-light, it’s the same story. Also, there’s beauty mode in there as well, which can do a pretty good job of beautifying your face.      Normal Mode Vs Beauty Mode   1  of 2               Normal Mode         Beauty Mode                  As for videos, the phone is capable of capturing  1080p videos @ 30 fps . Still shooting can produce good results, but with no  Image Stabilization , they tend to shake a lot even with the slightest amount of movement. Focusing, too, is very slow in videos.  Ironically, for a “selfie leader”, cameras, on this thing, are actually a hit and a miss!  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Performance  With the\xa0 Snapdragon 450  chip powering the phone, the phone should be powerful enough, but there are things holding it back. It can handle some heavy applications well enough. Playing Asphalt 9 was smooth enough, after some good amount of loading time. Also, PUBG is playable smoothly in low graphics and low frame rates. But  multi-tasking on it is a bit stuttery  as the  2GB RAM  on the device is just not enough, considering the  heavy ColorOS 5.1 skin on top  of the Android 8.1.  Out of 2GB, only  about 800 MB is usable  for multi-tasking, which is enough for small apps. But if you try doing that while playing games, you will start noticing the lags between transitions.  Even launching YouTube with some apps open in the background takes a while .      OPPO A3s Software UI   1  of 8                                                                                                  I mostly blame the heavy ColorOS skin for this. There’s a lot squeezed in the software and also plenty of bloatware on it. It runs deep into the UI and you will need a lot of getting used to with it.  Multi-tasking tray shows only the icons of the app running in the background and not their windows. But the thing that annoyed me most was  not being able to swipe and remove the notifications . You have to swipe left and delete them, which is very unsettling. Now, Oppo users must be used to this, but for me, it made for a not-so-good user experience.  However, the software does have some noteworthy features. Take  Game Space  for example, which is very useful while playing games. It  tweaks the graphics and offloads memory  wherever it can, so that you can play heavy games like PUBG on it without much glitches. But even so, some stutters can occur, as the small RAM can only do so much.  Storage  As for the storage, Oppo A3s  only has a 16 GB memory onboard . But there is a dedicated microSD card slot through which you can add up to 256 GB of storage, which you will need. Because if you just add a few games on it, you’ll begin to get low storage notifications. And moving those apps to your SD card is another hassle too.  Battery  This phone packs a huge battery – a humongous  4230 mAh unit ! It is probably the highlight of the device. With normal usage, I was even able to get two days of usage on it with a full charge. And with heavy usage, the battery still lasted the whole day and then some. Not having to keep peeking at the battery percentage while playing is actually great.   However, with the micro USB and  no Fast Charging feature , the phone  takes over 3 hours to fully charge!  With a huge battery such as this, there should have been a Fast Charging feature, but then again, it is unfair of me to ask all that for the price of this phone. So, I just stuck to charging it overnight.  Conclusion and Verdict  All in all, I have mixed feelings about this phone. It is well built with good design and features a satisfactory display. There’s  Face Recognition , which, even though it’s software, does a pretty good job, even in low-light. Although, I would’ve preferred a fingerprint sensor over that.  The big battery is the major highlight of the phone. Everything else is either just average or even lower. The Snapdragon 450 processor is held back by the small RAM, considering its heavy skin on top. Gaming is okay, but multi-tasking is satisfactory at best. The cameras are also nothing worth mentioning. And it may be just me talking, but I really didn’t like the UI. Also, while the display looks attractive, the lack of optimization of the apps for the notch kind of bugs you. Yes, many aspects of the phone are only average, but then again, I get reminded of its price!  If only they could’ve included 3 GB of RAM, the performance would’ve been commendable, but it might also have increased the price as well. However, due to the lack of good competition for this phone in the price segment, the Oppo A3s might be a good deal.  Pros:   Elegant design  Large display  Large battery  Good processor for the price   Cons:   Average camera  Small RAM and on-board storage  Speaker location  Heavy ColorOS UI  No LED Notification lights']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/OPPO-A3s-Review.jpg']
"['HTC U12 Life announced with Snapdragon 636, Dual Cameras, Splash-resistant']","['HTC', 'IFA 2018']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['September 1, 2018']",2018-09-01 03:43:24+00:00,"['There was a hype about HTC launching  a new “U” device  a week back. We already guessed it to be the HTC U12 Life, and it turned out to be true. While the Taiwanese smartphone company made an impact with its devices like the HTC U11 and the HTC U12 Plus. But even so, the company is in a downward spiral – and the U12 Life could very well be the last Life-series smartphone, i.e. if it doesn’t perform well.  However, that remains to be seen. As for now,  HTC unveiled the HTC U12 Life at IFA 2018  in Berlin. And HTC seems to have done quite a bit of addition, and subtraction with the phone. Getting the right mix of specs on a mid-range smartphone is a tricky business after all.         So, the U12 Life shares only its screen size with the premium U12 Plus. It sports a  6.0″ LTPS LCD display without a notch . The screen resolution is  Full HD+ (2160 x 1080)  with an  18:9 aspect ratio . Instead of the notch, it has noticeable bezels, but that is the trade-off we have to settle for. The acrylic unibody  doesn’t have any IP67  water or dust resistance, but HTC says it’s Splash-resistant, just like the OnePlus 6. Also, the design somewhat  resembles the Google Pixel , with two-tone colors at the back. In addition, it has brought back the  3.5 mm headphone jack !   There are dual cameras at the back: a  16 MP primary shooter  with a  5 MP secondary camera . The front camera is  a single 13 MP sensor . The phone is capable of recording 4K videos @30fps, but settles for  EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) instead of OIS .  Under the hood, a  Snapdragon 636  powers the phone backed by  4 GB of RAM . Also, it features  64 GB of on-board storage , with a hybrid microSD card slot. A considerably large  3600 mAh  is on board with Fast charging.  All in all, we can see that HTC is trying hard to cater to the customer wants. It brought back the headphone jack, has expandable storage, etc. but it cut some corners with the display resolution, removed HTC Edge Sense, and there’s no IP rating. And all that comes at a price of 279 pounds, which converts to  around $360 . Will the exchange pay off for HTC, or will it be last “Life” of HTC? With so much competition with the likes of Pocophone F1, we’ll have to see. The HTC U12 Life will go to sales starting late September.

Well, there were many rumors around already quite a while ago. Leaked specs and pictures were in full circle, and there were talks that the Motorola P30 in China was Motorola One for the global market, while Motorola P30 Note was supposed to equal the Motorola One Power.         \xa0  But, even if the One and One Power share their design and hardware with their Chinese counterparts, they’re separate entities on their own. The Motorola One Power seems to be a blend between the P30 and the P30 Note. The Motorola One looks like a new venture entirely. But the best thing about these phones is that  they run on the clean Android One . Hence the names, Motorola One and One Power.  The  Motorola One  features a  5.9″ IPS LCD display  with  HD+ resolution  and 19:9 aspect ratio, and a notch. The phone sports a glass back with a dual camera setup. It features a  13 MP primary sensor and a 2 MP depth sensor . Also, the front camera rests at an 8 MP sensor. Under the hood, a  Snapdragon 625 chipset  powers the phone with  4 GB of RAM . There’s also 64 GB of storage on board and  3000 mAh of battery .   The more premium of the duo, Motorola One Power has a slightly larger of everything. It features a  6.2″ IPS LCD display  with Full  HD+ resolution  with the same 19:9 aspect ratio. It’s pretty similar to the Motorola One in terms of design. Its dual camera rests at a  16 MP primary sensor with a 5 MP secondary lens . The front camera seems to be the same 8 MP lens.

I would be perfectly content watching a Full HD video (1080p) or even an HD (720p) one. I never realized how great these hi-res videos would be…until I watched a movie in 4K in one of those 4K TVs! For those of you, like me, who don’t think these hi-res stuff don’t matter…you are wrong! You don’t know what you’re missing until you experience it. And now, we’re moving past 4K. The future of TVs realized with  Samsung 8K QLED TV !   Samsung had been working on 8K televisions for quite a while, and we saw the result at the IFA 2018 in Berlin. Samsung and LG unveiled their 8K TV sets. But while LG thinks the public is not quite ready for such technology, Samsung is putting its 8K QLED TV for sale next month. Samsung coined the term themselves.  QLED means Quantum-dots-infused LED , which is supposed to have enhanced performance. Also, QLED’s are capable of achieving brightness levels never possible before.        Also Read:  Samsung TVs Price in Nepal\xa0  Samsung’s QLED TV is named  Samsung Q900R . It’s capable of achieving  4000 nits of peak brightness , which has never been possible before! The highest amount of brightness we’ve seen until now is only 2000 nits in LCD TVs. This will offer you punchier colors, better highlights, and redefine your definition of vibrant pictures. Also, the  Q900R is supporting HDR 10+ , which means it can also recognize and display certain highlights in pictures. The TV optimizes the brightness levels, so that the contents don’t appear darker than intended. In addition, the 4000 nits of peak brightness means you’ll be able to watch TV quite well, even in flooded light situations.   While there is no 8K content available out there to watch on this thing right now, the Q900R is also  capable of upscaling low resolution contents  to make it fit to watch on the bigger screen. For that, it has a special  AI upscaling software  that analyzes videos frame by frame and enhances the quality and sharpness. How cool is that? One thing is for sure, the Samsung Q900R will make an impact on our viewing experience. And why not? This is the television of the future. Now the only thing to do, for us, is to wait when the content creators will come up with 8K content.  The Samsung Q900R will  come out in sizes of 65″, 75″, 82″ and 85″ . While bigger is definitely better for a thing such as this, pick one that fits in your living room. Of course, right now, with the lack of 8K content, you don’t quite have a reason to get this TV right now. But Samsung has it out there, at it will start selling these sets next month, probably by October. There’s no word on the pricing yet. But we are sure, it will be put quite a hole in your wallet.

As a result, the company had to skip last year’s flagship. However, it seems to have gotten past all of that with the release of its new flagship – the ZTE Axon 9 Pro.  ZTE Axon 9 Pro Specifications  The ZTE Axon 9 Pro is the successor to the Axon 7 that had managed to create quite a buzz during its launch. The company has downgraded the display quality to a Full HD+ resolution from Axon 7’s Quad HD resolution. However, there is the inclusion of a HDR10 compliant display and an RGB sensor for better color accuracy.  The display this phone sports is a 6.21-inch AMOLED display with a notch on top. It is powered by the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and 6 GB of RAM. ZTE has included 128 GB of onboard memory on the device with an option to expand it up to 512 GB.        One of the major USPs of the ZTE Axon 9 Pro is definitely the software. The device comes under Google’s Android One platform which is as stock as a smartphone gets. That coupled with its internals, I certainly expect it to shine in the performance department. The device also has stereo speakers like its predecessor.   There are dual cameras on the back measuring 12 MP and 20 MP with another 20 MP camera sitting on the front. This selfie camera also works for facial recognition. A fingerprint scanner rests on the scratch-resistant glass back.  The ZTE Axon 9 Pro is also water resistant with the IP68 rating. There is a large 4,000 mAh battery lighting up the device. It is chargeable through its Quick Charge 4.0 enabled charger or you can use the Qi wireless charging method.  ZTE Axon 9 Pro Price and Availability  ZTE is well-known for its affordable flagships. Now, the Axon 9 Pro is cheaper than most of today’s high-end devices, but it is still expensive than the OnePlus 6 as it runs for €650. However, the OnePlus 6 lacks some of the features this device possesses.  ZTE hasn’t specified the exact date the Axon 9 Pro will be available in the market, but the device will first set foot in Europe. Asia launch will follow.

The liter version, however, makes sure that the iconic features of its predecessor are well preserved while keeping the price affordable.   The key2 LE has changes made in the internals with it featuring the  Snapdragon 636  while the Key2 greeted with a  Snapdragon 660  chipset.

The big bezels on the top and bottom of the phones were just too traditional for the market that was opting for a bezel-less design. However, during the unveiling of its new product, the Sony Xperia XZ3, the Japanese giant seemed to have learned from that mistake as this is another Sony phone that has ditched the traditional form factor.  Sony Xperia XZ3 Specifications  The Sony Xperia XZ3 is a high-end flagship by all means. It has a tall 6-inch Quad HD+ display that ends in curves. Now, these curves are not as curvy as Samsung’s take, but the design is absolutely stunning to look at. The screen has the 18:9 aspect ratio and no notch at the top. The device also dons an OLED panel – the first on any Sony smartphone. There is Gorilla Glass 5 protection on both sides, and the Xperia XZ3 is water resistant with IP65/68 certification.  In terms of internals, the Sony Xperia XZ3 has the best chipset from Qualcomm – the Snapdragon 845 inside. This octa-core CPU is aided by 4 GB of RAM and Adreno 630 GPU. The smartphone features only one 64 GB storage variant. However, the option to let users expand it up to 512 GB makes up for everything. This device will run on the latest Android 9.0 Pie out of the box and will feature the all-new gesture setting which lets users add shortcut while swiping through the curved sides.         Camera wise, the Sony Xperia XZ3 features a 19-megapixel single camera on the back with f/2.0 aperture. This camera is accompanied by an LED flash and laser autofocus. It is capable of taking 1080p videos at 960fps as well. On paper, this camera certainly doesn’t carry bells and whistles, but it will be interesting to see how Sony has implemented the whole setup. On the front lies a 13-megapixel front-facing camera with f/1.9 aperture.  The Sony Xperia XZ3 has a 3,300 mAh battery which is supported by Quick Charge 3.0.

But how great are they? Well, we don’t really know that right now. The GPUs still have a little over 3 weeks to go officially on sale, and we will only know about their capabilities then. Until that time, we have their specs on paper for judgement. There are a few leaked fps results on the web, but we will discredit them due to obvious reasons.   Nvidia specifically focuses on the Ray Tracing feature a lot, and thanks to the Turing architecture, these cards are capable of the same. The RTX 2070 is about 6 times faster than last year’s GTX 1080Ti in terms of Ray Tracing capabilities. To be fair, the 1080Ti wasn’t specifically designed to do Ray Tracing in the first place. Nevertheless, Nvidia did release a few game trailers that will take advantage of the hardware’s new capabilities.  The 2080Ti, when overclocked to the max, makes about 1/5th of the noise a GTX 1080Ti produces. That’s some impressive cooling solution. Nvidia says the 13 blade axial fans and a full sized vapour\xa0chamber helps with the cooling immensely. Although, they did add that running the 20 series graphics cards on a Razer Core might not result in similar acoustics.   The new graphics cards will also be a lot better at overclocking, well comparatively at least. The 8K HDR@60Hz is at stock setting on a DP 1.4a with DSC is supported on stock settings. There is also a new NV Link for SLI connection, with speeds of almost 100Gbps and a price of just $79.  There is a lot more to know about these new cards, including the newer Quadro lineup as well. With a lot of emphasis on the quality of the games rather than raw fps numbers, it will be interesting to see how the whole gaming community reacts to it. But until then, all we can do is wait and enjoy every bit of rumours we can get.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/nvidia-rtx.jpg']

This time around, we have OPPO’s latest offering, the OPPO Realme 2. When put in comparison with the Realme 1, the Realme 2 seems like a slight downgrade in the processor department with the  Snapdragon 450  Soc rather than the  Helio P60 .  Similarly, the Realme 2 does not\xa0really feel like a real successor because apart from the choice of chipset, RAM has also been compromised to 4 GB and 3 GB options only. While the Realme 1 resembled the F7 Youth, the successor looks like the OPPO A3S with a fingerprint sensor. However, what is an improvement is that the Realme 2 has a bigger battery this time, with a capacity of 4230 mAh.         Display wise, it has a 6.2-inch screen which is 0.2 inches bigger than its predecessor, but the resoultion has been downgraded from FullHD+ to HD+. Similarly, the camera setup is also different with the Realme 2 featuring dual 13+2 MP cameras at the back and an 8 MP shooter at the front.

There’s a good  3,700 mAh battery  on it with USB-C and  Fast Charging support .  The phone does look good on paper. But like always, I think Samsung fails to deliver the X-factor in it. I mean, it costs as much as the OnePlus 6 in India, but it falls short from it with a good margin. For instance, the OnePlus 6 features the Snapdragon 845 while the A8 Star only has the SD 660!  Even the Huawei Nova 3 has a similar price tag with a much better processor. I don’t mean to demean the Galaxy A8 Star when it has just come out, but it’s already there for everyone to see. Maybe there are some aspects where this phone can outshine the competition. We’ll have to see later on.  Even though it’s a global variant, it’s exclusive to India for now. But it should soon make its way to other markets, and hopefully, to Nepal. And it might be priced close to Rs. 60,000 here. What do you think of the Samsung Galaxy A8 Star?

And few months after the U12, the Taiwanese company is hinting at another U-device by the end of this month. What else can it be other than  HTC U12 Life ? The Life series are the cheaper alternatives to the U-series flagships. And the U12 Life should be an alternative to last year’s U11 Life.  HTC U11 Life was released on December last year. And even if it might be too early to launch U12 Life, I cannot think of any other U-device. HTC said they were going to reveal a new U device through their twitter page very recently.         And so, it leads me to believe that this new “U” device is definitely the HTC U12 Life, as we also caught some leaks of HTC’s new  project code-named “Imagine Life” , back in July. So, if it is indeed the HTC U12 Life, we also have some idea about what specs it will have.   The phone will have  6.0″ of Super LCD Full-HD+ display  on a plastic build, which will also sport an  IP-67 Dust and Water Resistance . Under the hood, it should sport a  Snapdragon 636  with  4 GB RAM  and  64 GB of storage . It’s sure to feature a dual camera on the rear and will most likely ship with  Android 8.1 Oreo . The phone might be priced  between $300 to $400 ! But we will have to wait until August 30 to confirm everything.  However, whatever device HTC lands, it will very well be “all for naught” in Nepal. Since HTC U12 Plus didn’t even show up in Nepal,  it’s very unlikely that the HTC U12 Life will . Also, the company’s profits have been declining, and since it has shut down its operations in the neighboring country, India,  no HTC device might make its way here !

And now, it is official. The  Oppo R17 Pro , is here with the familiar design of the R17 – with an additional camera at the back. But also, something more peculiar –  two batteries !   And along with the Oppo R17 Pro unveiled, the  price and availability of the R17 is also made official . It costs about 3500 Chinese Yuan, which converts to some US $510. But by the looks of it, it probably won’t be available directly in retail stores internationally. However, you can order it online, and it will begin Shipping from August 30.        Anyways, the Oppo R17 Pro features the same design as the Oppo R17 – only with bumped up specs. For instance, it features the same  6.4″ HD+ AMOLED panel , but with a slightly higher resolution of  2340 x 1080 . And there’s something else that’s familiar about it. A  triple lens camera setup  at the back, just like the Huawei P20 Pro. However, the setup consists of a  20 MP main sensor, a 12 MP secondary sensor  and a  3D Stereo Camera lens , which supposedly supports AR features.   Under the hood, the phone features  8 GB of RAM  with  128 GB storage . It is powered by the  Snapdragon 710 processor . The display integrates the fingerprint sensor into integrated in the display itself,\xa0 just like the R17. But the peculiar thing about the R17 Pro is it’s  two batteries of 1850 mAh each, making it a total of 3700 mAh . Oppo claims that these two work together in tandem to give you  40% of charge in 10 minutes ! But other than that, I don’t understand the point of having two different units – if they’re going to work together anyway.  Also Read:  OPPO Mobiles Price in Nepal  It’s now clear how much this Pro model will cost. But I guess the availability is no different – you have to ship it through online orders. And so, it is not likely to make its way to Nepal. But even so, it is something that provides great value, and does look tempting enough to order it online.']",[]
['Jisoncase Luxury Cases for your phones: Worth the price?'],[],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['August 24, 2018']",2018-08-24 10:27:56+00:00,"['If you have a phone, you have a case on it. Almost all of us do. Given that cases reduce the original look and feel of your phone. But you wouldn’t want to drop it and lose it all at once, would you? And so, we’re always looking for cases to cover our phones – one that will look, feel and work good. For that very purpose, we have here the Jisoncase, which is pretty close to what you want in a case.  We received a review unit from Jisoncase for the Samsung Galaxy S9, and in two weeks of slapping it on my phone, I think its  simple, yet luxurious . The best thing about it is that it’s pretty slim! It appears to be made out of PC material wrapped in some suede-like material. It’s somewhat flexible, so, pretty easy to snap on and off. All of it is wrapped in the soft material, so, it won’t scratch your phone from the inside. The buttons on it are solid and give tactile feedback. Its soft lining gives you a  premium feel  on your hands as well – making it  appear quite luxurious ! This material is also washable, but rightfully, so, because it can get dirty!         However, it offers solid protection as I’ve dropped my Galaxy S9 quite a few times from table heights, and it has survived with this case so far! But I am a bit skeptical about it surviving drops from greater heights.        1  of 2                                      Jisoncase makes  luxury and premium cases  with genuine materials for those high-end phones and tablets. Say, if you want something classy for your iPhone, or iPad or your Samsung flagships. Usually, they make high-quality leather cases and similar soft materials. Its all about some luxury and a bit of protection. And they also ship their products to Nepal, provided that you have an international payment method like Paypal. So, if you want a luxury case that will add to the premium-ness of your phones, Jisoncase can give you what you want – it’s slim, feels luxurious, and looks very sleek. Suits your phone just right!

The  Google Pixel 3 XL got leaked in all its glory . There are pictures, specs, camera-samples, and everything. This means that you can see everything you want to see about the Google Pixel 3 XL – from it’s design to its packaging. Whether these leaks are authentic or not, we don’t know… but here’s a peak as well.  Let’s start with the most noticeable feature – the infamous notch! It is not a surprise for the Pixel to jump into the hype-train either. Well, that…and we had already seen Android 9.0 Pie optimized to support notches in its review. So, yeah. And since everything was leaked by a Russian personality, all the images you see has Russian language in it.         Here’s a full view of what the Pixel 3 XL looks like. The design doesn’t seem to have changed that much. Only, this one  has smaller bezels , yet there still seems to be a chin at the bottom. Why, Google? If it serves no purpose, just get rid of it! On the back, we can again see the same familiar design. While Google jumped on the notch-hype train, it still  didn’t set up dual cameras . Looking at the design, it makes me feel like Google’s not even trying anymore. I mean, come on!  And there’s also an image showing what you get inside the retail box of the Google Pixel 3 XL. The package includes a USB-C to USB-C cable, charging adapter, a USB-C to USB-A adapter, and a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. However, this time around,  Google seems to have included a pair of headphones , which, surprisingly looks like a wired version of Google’s Pixel buds. But don’t get too excited…we don’t really know if it is even authentic!  Here are also the specs of the Google Pixel 3 XL, if you can read it. However, we can make out that the  Pixel 3 XL has a 6.71″ QHD+ resolution (1440 x 2960)  and a  3430 mAh battery . Again, we can’t be very sure of the leaks, but this is what it suggests.  I, personally, feel as if these are somehow fake! Google knows how to keep secrets, doesn’t it? I mean they could have themselves leaked these on purpose, for some reason. But whatever it is, I hope it isn’t real. The design isn’t appealing at all, and call it a gut feeling…but this does not feel like the Google Pixel 3 XL to me! I have very high hopes for the device!  Google will announce the phone sometime in October, and I seriously hope that it takes a turn from all that we can see here. What do you think of these leaks? If this was the real Google Pixel 3 XL, would you even buy it?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pixel-3-leaks.jpg']

Well, the Oppo F9 Pro did come out in India. But here’s a kicker. The  Oppo F9 we knew about is also the F9 Pro ! And the Pro model has only very slight changes to show for its name. Anyways, they’re out in India, so, it might come out in similar fashion in Nepal as well. And it is  launching on August 29  in Nepal!  Both the  Oppo F9 and Oppo F9 Pro have similar specs  – from the design to the battery. The only difference is in the RAM. While we knew Oppo F9 had two RAM options – a 4 GB and a 6 GB variant, the company decided that they could launch those two phones under different names in the region. And so, now we have the  4 GB RAM variant as the Oppo F9  and the  6 GB variant as the F9 Pro . Also, the  Pro model sports Oppo’s VOOC fast charging  whereas the regular Oppo model doesn’t.         Besides that, there isn’t a single difference between the two. Both the phones feature a  6.3″ LTPS IPS LCD HD+ display  in 19.5:9 aspect ratio, which, Oppo calls the Waterdrop display. The display has a tiny notch shaped like a water drop for the front camera. While that design is considered unique, I will remind you that the Essential Phone did it first!   The cameras are also the same in both models.  A dual camera setup of 16 MP sensor with PDAF and a 2 MP depth sensor at the back with a 25 MP selfie shooter at the front.  Both feature the headphone jack as well. Also, there’s a\xa0 3500 mAh battery  in them. But with VOOC charging on the F9 Pro, it is able to offer you 2 hours of talk time in 5 minutes of charge, while the regular F9 won’t be able to do that.\xa0The Oppo F9 and F9 Pro are powered by  MediaTek Helio P60 processor . There’s  64 GB storage on board  and is expandable up to 256 GB via a  dedicated microSD card slot .  The difference between those two is very subtle, but the pricing is not. The regular F9 costs  Rs.19,990 (INR) in India , which converts to around  Rs.31,990 in Nepal . And the F9 Pro costs  Rs.23,990 (INR) , which converts to  Rs.38,385 in here . No doubt that they will be a bit more expensive than that when they launch here though, with the taxes and all. In addition, since, these phones have already launched in India, they will launch in a few days, here.  But, we still cannot be sure how this will launch in Nepal, though. The international smartphone market scenario is different. What we now call the Oppo F9 Pro, is the regular F9 for them, so, they might see an upgraded version as the F9 Pro. Will Nepal get the international version of the Oppo F9 or follow our neighbor? I think it will the same as in India, but let’s wait until it launches, here,  on August 29 !  Anyway, which do you think is the better option, the F9 or the F9 Pro? If these phones launch under 40,000 price, that would be great news! But let us see.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/oppo-f9-pro.jpg']

And with that, speculations are high: Will it be a new MacBook again, or for the love of God, a new MacBook Air? While Apple did refresh its 12-inch MacBook in June of last year, it also regularly updates its MacBook Pro. But, as for the MacBook Air…it’s the definition of “consistency”. It still features the same outdated 5th-gen processor, low-res screen, wide bezels, and still costs a $1000! But as  2018 is the 10th anniversary of MacBook Air , we gotta ask. Is a new MacBook Air coming out?  Well, Apple is definitely set to launch a new laptop around September, as per reports. Previously, rumors were that the launch was going to happen in the 2nd half of 2018, and now, it’s most probably going to happen in September. And what’s more? This one is meant to be an inexpensive laptop – designed for people on a budget, mostly students and the likes. The low cost model will sport the  same design as the current MacBook Air . It will still have the same 13-inch screen but with  higher resolution  and Apple’s  Retina display ! In addition, it will also have  slimmer bezels . But more importantly, will they put in new-gen chips in them?         We’re eager to see what Apple means by low-cost, though. Current MacBook Air models cost $999 now, and the 12-inch MacBook costs $1300! If they could refresh the new model and cut off the price by a couple hundred dollars, wouldn’t that be great? But it’s Apple…so, fingers crossed! Let’s hope that the new inexpensive models of MacBooks will be the refreshed MacBook Air.  And while a new MacBook Air might really come out, Apple is also working on the new Mac Mini! Either one should release in September, along with the new iPhone, maybe. And the reports say that if there are delays, it won’t push later than October. Either way, we’re looking at an  inexpensive laptop from Apple . And there are high chances that it will be a new MacBook Air.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/macbook2015.jpg']

The Chinese smartphone manufacturer that we mostly know for ZTE Blade and ZTE Axon series was struggling with a 7-year ban on it by the US Government. The reason was ZTE using US components in their phones in regions it wasn’t supposed to. Plus, there were some international trade violations and such. Further, it went down deeper trying to hide its allegations. Why ZTE did that; we’ll never know. But the result was  a 7-year ban which blocked ZTE  from buying chips from any American companies. This forced ZTE to stop its production facilities, and halt global smartphone sales.  After going through such an ordeal, ZTE paid a fine of US $ 1 billion to have its ban lifted. This only happened after months long of back-and-forth between the Chinese and American governments. But, that paid off finally, as now, the firm can operate in the US, but will have to re-brand their name in the US. Even so, ZTE is not all in the clear. The US Commerce Department will closely monitor all its actions from now on.         However, for now,  ZTE is back . And probably, it is going to bounce back with a bang! Very recently, the company  hinted at a new smartphone launch at the IFA  – The Global Innovators Show in Berlin. Based on the tweets, the company will be present at the IFA with “Leading 5G innovations” and there were leaked images hinting at a new phone, most probably,  the Axon 9 ! While ZTE needs to rebuild its image, we are looking forward to the new phone.   And if it does bounce back, it also means more affordable smartphones in the Nepali market as well. ZTE has affordable mid-range smartphones in Nepal. And with its comeback, maybe we’ll have even more options to choose from.  Also Read:  ZTE Mobiles Price in Nepal  What do you think of ZTE phones?

['Samsung Galaxy Note 9 launched in Nepal'],['Samsung'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['August 17, 2018']",2018-08-17 02:34:01+00:00,"['The excitement is real!! The  Samsung Galaxy Note 9  is here in Nepal, too! When it comes to bringing the latest and the best in Nepal, Samsung does quite a job. The Galaxy Note 9 launched shortly in international markets, and it’s already available for purchase in Nepal.   Overview:  In Nepal, you can get the Galaxy Note 9 in  three different colors: Metallic Copper, Ocean Blue, and Midnight Black ! If I were you, I’d go for the copper one, but the blue one seems to appeal to many.         The Galaxy Note 9 features a large  6.4″ Super AMOLED Quad-HD+ display  on a premium looking glass and metal body. The phones is built really well, with nicely curved edges and sturdy grip. Aesthetically and a visually pleasing form factor. The fingerprint sensor is at the right place, and it gets the  same Dual Camera setup of the Galaxy S9+ –\xa0two 12 MP sensors  with OIS and variable apertures.  The improvement is the AI-enabled cameras, which Samsung calls  Scene Optimization . This detects elements in a scene like flowers or sky and enhances the brightness, color saturation and sharpness. Let’s see how this competes against Huawei’s AI cameras. But there’s also the  Flaw Detection feature . This notifies you immediately if there is a problem in the background or some kind of blurs while taking pictures. So, you don’t have to worry about bad pictures now, do you?   Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 packs the  Exynos 9810 chip  with  6 GB and 8 GB RAM options . That is quite the power, isn’t it? Also, Samsung has embedded\xa0 liquid-cooling  on the device to boost gaming performance and minimize thermal throttling while playing high-end games. And with a  beefy 4000 mAh battery , this thing is sure to last you a full day!  The S-Pen is one of the most exciting things about this phone and this takes Samsung’s stylus game to a new level. You can even use it as a  remote control  to do things with your S-Pen. By default, it’s programmed for your camera, but it can be programmed for other things too!

['Xiaomi Mi8 SE Review: The Perfect Midranger?'],"['Reviews', 'Xiaomi']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['August 16, 2018']",2018-08-16 11:07:17+00:00,"['Xiaomi recently released a set of devices, namely the  MI8, the Mi 8 explorer and the Mi 8 SE.  Well, today we have with us the Mi8 SE. Now, this device has made headlines because it has quite a list of impressive specifications on paper. But how does it perform in real life? Well, let’s dive into the Mi8 SE review.   Design  When you look at the Mi 8 SE, you can’t help but notice how premium it looks. The device has a glass back that looks quite elegant. The metal frame around the display certainly sets it apart. The phone is slim and lightweight which makes it even more appealing.        It is protected by some sort of Gorilla Glass, but Xiaomi has not revealed exactly which one but the presence of Gorilla Glass is always welcoming. Although the phone looks premium, the glass back, unfortunately, is a fingerprint magnet. I am using the red version which is an eye candy.   There is no Micro SD card slot meaning that you will not be able to expand the storage. There’s also no headphone jack, and the sound for the single speaker is just about average.  But the top of the phone, you get an IR blaster, which I must say, other manufacturers, miss out. Like all the other phones nowadays, you get a notch that is actually a little wider than the others. But like it or not, the notch is there!  Display  Up front, the MI 8 SE features a 5.88-inch AMOLED display with very minimum bezels. As the word AMOLED suggests, you get a display with deep blacks and good color reproduction. The display is also bright and vibrant.   Having said that, the brightness it provides is satisfactory. I mean, outdoors too it gives good visibility. The viewing angles of this device have got me impressed and display wise I have no complaints whatsoever.  Camera  The camera set up on the back of the MI 8 SE is a dual 12+5 MP shooter, where the secondary sensor works for depth sensing only.  The camera app is friendly enough on use, meaning it’s not confusing when trying to tweak some settings. There’s AI mode which detects the scenes and enhances the color and dynamic range.  Talking about the quality of images, for the price, I must say they look nice and vibrant. The colors are good and punchy, but I found it to be a little bit oversaturated to my liking.      Xiaomi Mi8 SE Camera Samples   1  of 9                                                                                                            Taking still Portrait shots, they are satisfactory if not the best. Low light images have noise with limited dynamic range, but for the price, it’s not that bad.\xa0Selfies are great with good dynamic range, color accuracy, and details.  Something I am, well a little disappointed with is the video recording of this device. There’s no OIS or 60fps, but Xiaomi has included EIS which helps to get stabilization to some extent. There is native shakiness in 4K videos. The videos in 1080p are stabilized in comparison so, I recommend you use the latter for best outcomes.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Battery  The Xiaomi Mi 8 SE offers you a 3,120 mAh battery with USB Type C port for fast charging and data syncing. The fact that this device packs an energy efficient SD 710 processor and an AMOLED display has also helped it have a good battery life.  The battery lasts for almost a day at normal usage like for social media usage, surfing the internet, occasional gaming, etc. I had to put this device on charge every morning and return home with around 15% juice in it.   So, I would say that the battery life not so great but keeps you going for at least a day’s use. To balance it out, the device supports fast charging, so I had very less to whine about in the battery department.  Performance  The insides of the device are handled by one of the fresh lineups of Qualcomm’s chipsets, the Snapdragon 710 along with 4GB of RAM. This is also one of the reasons the device is getting so much attention and I was very eager to test it. The chipset comes with AI capabilities and supports Quick charge 4+.  On use, the performance is no less impressive. The device handles all your multitasking needs and gaming needs very efficiently. I played the Asphalt 9, which ran smooth as a breeze. Similarly, everyone’s favorite PUBG also ran with minimum hiccups. Talking about app opening, it does a commendable job here too.  Software  Moving on to the Software, you get the latest Android Oreo 8.1 coupled with MIUI 9.5 and the MI8 SE is waiting to get the MIUI10 update. I reviewed the Chinese version as the Global version is not there yet in my part of the world. Due to that reason, the absence of Google apps is evident here, so I had to download them by myself but that is a not a major issue.      Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Software UI   1  of 6                                                                              Other than that, you get a nice clean feel in the UI. Likewise, the fingerprint sensor is swift and accurate. I usually prefer the fingerprint sensor to be located in front, but the sensor on this one is located at the back. However, it is in a comfortable distance at the back so I didn’t have any problem, but it totally depends upon your choice. The facial unlock is fast too but in low lighting conditions, it took a relatively longer to recognize me.  Conclusion:  The MI 8 SE seems to beat most of the other mid-range devices. It’s not officially available in Nepal, but you can get it from Gear Best. With the new SD 710 onboard, you get power-packed performance, a good if not best cameras, decent enough battery life with fast charging, stunning premium looks and an excellent AMOLED display. There are very few reasons why I should not recommend this device to anyone. I think Xiaomi has got another winner here with the Mi8 SE.      Pros  Cons    Attractive Looks  No MicroSD support (64GB option only available)    Great Display  Average Audio Output    Excellent Performance    Good Cameras']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/xiaomi-mi8-SE-review.jpg']

Motorola is known for manufacturing a durable phone that provides a good value for your money. And with a similar vision, Motorola unveiled a new phone. The Motorola Moto P30 is official!  However, there are certain uninteresting aspects to it. For instance, the Moto P30 comes in a very familiar design. We cannot blame smartphones these days for sporting all the same looks. But, the P30 comes with an  iPhone X  like notch and camera setup, while its color will remind you of some Huawei phones. It comes in three different colors: Ice White, Bright Black and what Motorola calls Aurora Blue, Huawei calls it Iris Purple! And Lenovo states that this phone has been “ made for China “, for now, but we certainly hope to see it in other markets.  Motorola Moto P30 Features & Specifications:  Meanwhile, the Motorola Moto P30 features a  6.2″ IPS LCD display  with  Full HD+ resolution . The bezels are tiny, but it has a notch, that resembles the iPhone X uncannily. Even the dual camera set up at the back reminds you of that. It has a  fingerprint sensor at the back, which doubles as the Motorola logo at the back . Clever use of space, right? The Moto P30 retains the headphone jack, which is nice, and has  two speaker grills . So, the sound must be great!         \xa0  The dual camera setup is a\xa0combination of  16 MP sensor with f/1.8 aperture  and a  5 MP sensor with f/2.2 aperture.  It supports 1080p video recording with background blur and certain other effects while the front camera is a  12 MP lens with f/2.0 aperture .  Under the hood, an  octa-core Snapdragon 636  powers the phone with  6 GB of RAM . It sports  3000 mAh battery , that also comes with Fast Charging support. There are 2 variants in terms of storage options: a  64 GB model  and a  128 GB model . But there is a microSD card slot for the expandable option.  Motorola used to be known for providing a close to stock Android experience, but the Motorola Moto P30 runs on\xa0 Lenovo’s ZUI 4.0  on top of  Android 8.0 Oreo . That certainly comes as a bit of disappointment. But the Moto P30 will also receive Android Pie update later this year! Anyways, for now, the phone is only available in China. The Chinese Yuan price roughly converts to $289 for 64 GB model or $303 for the 128 GB one. We might see some price changes if it makes it to international markets.  For the price, it certainly is a good mid-range device. If it comes to Nepal, would you consider buying it?

['Android 9.0 Pie: Everything You Need to Know'],"['Android', 'Google Pixel']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['August 12, 2018']",2018-08-12 15:30:25+00:00,"['It was a big day in the Androidverse last week. Google released the final version of its much anticipated OS, the Android 9, for its Pixel lineup of devices. It was available for download from 6th of August. If you are one of the few Essential PH – 1 users around the world, you’re also in luck! An OTA rolled out for the Essential phone as well. Google decided to go with the name ‘ Pie ’ for it’s 9th major iteration of Android. The Android 9 Pie beta was available for Pixel phones since the last Google I/O but this is the first official release.\xa0  The  full version is 1173 MB  but I was already on the Developer Preview. So, I only needed to download a smaller OTA update of 45.5 MB for the final release.          There are quite a few changes on this version of Android, both visual and under the hood. The key changes are\xa0 AI, Wellbeing and Simplicity . Here are some of the major design changes below in no particular order. \xa0   Android now has  gesture based navigation . A little pill resides at the bottom of the screen that is your handlebar for all gestures. If you’re downloading the whole full version, it becomes your default navigation system. However, It can be changed inside  System > Gesture settings .   This is probably the most visible and tangible change that you will find in Android Pie. It will also definitely take some time to become familiar with. This is what the new gesture based navigation does:    Home : Tap on the pill to go to your home screen.  Recept Apps Overview : A short swipe up will show recent apps along with a set of five apps suggested by Google’s AI based on prediction and your usage of various apps.   App Drawer : Push the pill all the way up and \xa0you will get into the app drawer. This is accessible from any screen and you don’t need to be on the home screen to launch it.  View all open apps : Pull the pill to the right and hold it to quickly launch the recent apps and switch between them. You can slide the pill left and right to flip in between open apps. Release the pill to launch the app on the overview screen. Holding the pill to the extreme left or right of the sliding bar will run a slideshow like animation of all your open apps, from either left to right or right to left.  App Switch : One quick flick to the right will open your last launched app. This can be done from any screen.  Back Button : The pill is always right and doesn’t go left. That is where you will find a little back button which does exactly what the name suggests.   Here’s how it works:   As modern as this new gesture based navigation is, it could’ve been made better. Maybe minimizing the empty space it occupies at the bottom of the screen? Even though the buttons are out, it still takes the same amount of space. The back button functionality could easily have been integrated into the pill gesture itself eliminating the need for one extra button that’s neither symmetric nor really necessary. I like OnePlus’s implementation of gestures on their  OnePlus 6 better  – saves space, isn’t an eyesore and works flawlessly. No wonder MKBHD chose OP6 over the Pixel 2 XL!  Android Pie features  more colors  now. The Settings menu now has colorful icons. Also, the notification bar icon turns blue when the particular setting is activated. The earlier Android version was just plain gray bland. This is a welcome change for those who prefer a bit more color in their phones and lives as well.   One slight change with the status bar is that the  clock is shifted to the left  of the bar. This signals a change in Google’s strategy to give room to devices with the notch in the middle. I’m looking at you, Pixel 3!   The ever so smart Pixel is now even smarter with Android Pie. There are subtle but useful touches throughout the system that shows you how powerful AI and machine learning have become. Some of the areas where you will see AI and ML in action are:   Swiping up to launch recent apps overview will  suggest you a set five apps  that you are likely to launch based on your usage of the phone. This changes every time you swipe up.  The Pixel launcher also shows you the same set of your five apps on the very top above all the rest.  Just below the suggested app on the Pixel launcher you are presented with  two suggested app actions , such as calling your favorite contact, or messaging them.    The more you use your phone the better these suggestions get and it’ll almost be an extension of yourself. Think of an app and it will present itself on your phone.   Changing the screen orientation is easier than before. You no longer have to change it from within the notification shade for every app on the phone. Whenever you  tilt the phone a little screen rotate icon will appear  on the navigation bar and wiggle for your attention. Clever use of space if you ask me. Tap on this to quickly rotate the screen for that one particular app you’re on. And you don’t have to pull down the notification shade and turn on screen rotation for all the apps on your phone.   Google also introduced a new inbuilt app called  Digital Wellbeing  which shows how much time you’re spending on your phone and which apps you use the most, among other things. It helps you monitor your phone usage and hopefully wean yourself away from your phone if you’re a phone addict like me. It’s still in beta currently. You can sign up for the same  here . You need a Pixel device with Android 9.0 running to be eligible for the beta program. (There might also be apks floating around the Internet but use it at your own risk!.)    Digital Wellbeing will show you      Your total phone usage time today  Apps you used during that time  How many time you unlocked your phone today  How many notifications you received today  A list of apps on your phone that you can sort by:   Amount of screen time each had  Number of notifications each received   Number of times the app launched  Historical data for days gone by        From within the Digital Wellbeing app you can configure the  Wind Down mode  for your phone. This allows you to set a time at night or during the evening where you’d like the phone to turn to gray-scale and look boring in an attempt to be uninteresting so that you will put it away and go to sleep. Gimmicky? Maybe. But it’s there.   It has options to set a timer for individual app to remind you that you need to stop using the app so much. You can also configure the Wind Down mode to turn on at certain hours. You can configure  Wind Down, Gray-scale, Do Not Disturb  and  Night Light  to effectively control your phone usage and make it more eyes and sleep friendly.  A new mode is added alongside Battery Saver called  Adaptive Battery . This uses machine learning to predict what apps and you use and need the most and will automatically put the lesser used apps and services in an energy efficient mode saving power. Something else that your phones will adapt to is your brightness settings based on your usage at certain time of day and for certain apps.   You can now also  copy and paste texts in between apps  when in recent apps overview. Just hold down and select the text you want to copy while the recent apps overview is on and paste it onto the app you want to copy it to.   Using split screen has changed as well. You now need to tap the app icon on top on overview and then select split screen from the menu to open the app in a split screen. Pressing the pill to go to home screen will still keep the app on the first half of the screen minimized while keeping the home screen accessible. Once you launch another app that supports split screen the previously minimized app will be restored to the top half of the screen along with the new app on the second half. This works well in portrait as well as landscape orientations.   Do you have friends who forcibly put your finger against the scanner to unlock your phone? Android Pie now features a specially fortified  Lock down mode  accessible from the Power menu that will disable all fingerprint scanner and facial recognition to unlock your phone. It will only let a password to get through. You can now sleep in peace.   Taking a screen-shot now presents you with added options to share, edit or delete the screen-shot. You can  scribble over the screen-shot  and annotate using the inbuilt editor.   Volume controls now appear on the right side of the screen close to the volume rocker instead of up on the screen. They are easier to reach. The default volume, now, is media volume instead of the ringer.   Previously the theme was controlled by the color of the background you chose. Dark background enabled the dark theme by default whereas lighter background would set the theme as light. You can now manually select the theme color from within Display settings to have it set to be Dark if you want to save battery on the AMOLED screen device.   There’s also a battery percentage indicator at the bottom of the display on the Always On Display. This is a useful addition to the AOD. The weather is also displayed under the clock in Android P next to the date. While these are useful in day to day usage there’s still no way for a user to interact with the notifications. The whole premise behind AOD is that it requires only a fraction of your battery and having to light up the screen every time you want to swipe or expand a notification defeats the purpose, especially when Google has done so much over the years to make notifications continuously better.   And once again other OEMs such as OnePlus 6’s come on top because of their customization and ease of use. Nevertheless, this is one of the biggest updates Android has received in years and hopefully Google will listen to its users and keep making improvements to make Android the king of smartphone OS that it deserves to be.    There doesn’t seem to be any major bugs or issues with this release but I suggest you reset your phone after you’ve updated your device if you’re seeing anything out of the ordinary.

Really, how much can you actually do with a computer without an access to the world wide web? Daraz knows this and is giving out free  Worldlink internet packages  on almost all the laptops in their online store. This Daraz laptop deals make it a really nice package for the end consumers, and even if you already have an active internet at home, I guess two is better than one right?  The speed of the free internet connection you get depends on the price of the laptop you are about to purchase. But whatever low the prices may be, you will still get the speed of 20Mbps in the least. The free internet lasts for 3 months if you buy a laptop priced below 50k.  If you choose to purchase a  laptop with a price tag below 1 lakh  and above 50k, you will receive the same 20Mbps but for 6 months. This shouldn’t be much of a surprise as the more money you spend, the better the free gifts get.        As for laptops above the 1 lakh barrier, you will receive internet speeds of 50Mbps for 6 months. This goes all the way to the most expensive laptops available on Daraz, which includes a certain laptop known as the  Predator\xa0Triton 700  priced at a whopping 4.3lakhs. Although if you ask me, this laptop isn’t actually worth its price tag.  The list also includes some models that feature CPUs that are 5 generations old, like the  Viao Fit14  priced at Rs 50k for something with an i3-3227U, which is just such a bad deal. So here are a few laptops that should be worth buying.  Acer E5 (Best laptop priced below Rs 50k)  The Acer E5 comes with the latest 8th gen i3 processor, a 14″ FullHD display, 4GB of RAM and 1TB HDD. The laptop should be fine for office use, basic tasks, and media consumption. The 8th gen i3 and FHD display is really something of a luxury at this price. You can check out the laptop  here .  Acer Aspire E15 (Best laptop priced below Rs 80k)   The Acer Aspire E15 comes with a few bells and wistles like a dedicated MX150 GPU and a Quad Core 8th gen i5 CPU. Paired with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of HDD should give you no problems when it comes to performance. Although, if possible don’t forget to add an SSD. You can check out the laptop  here .  Dell Inspiron 7577/7370\xa0(Best laptop priced below Rs 100k)   Well, if you are gamer, get the 7577, if not the 7370 should do just fine. The 7370 comes with a 13.3 inch highly portable body. It also gets the 8th gen i7 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. This should deliver no problems when it comes to performance, but will definitely lack the power to handle graphics-intensive tasks.   For that, you will need the 7577, which comes with a 7th gen 45W i5 CPU, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, 15.6″ FHD display, but the best of all a dedicated GTX 1050Ti. You can check the 7577  here  and the 7370  here .  Dell Inspiron 7588/XPS 13\xa0(Best laptop priced below Rs 150k)   The Dell 7588 is Dell’s new gaming series laptops, they come with 8th gen six core i7 processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD\xa0storage, and best of all a GTX1060 Max Q dedicated GPU. You should be able to play any game in FHD with ease on this one. Check it out  here .   The second laptop is for all the non-gamers out there. It’s the Dell XPS 13 which comes with a 7th gen i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and a 13″\xa0FHD display. This seems like a really over an expensive laptop but the build quality is rarely this good on a laptop along with a few other defining qualities. Check it out  here .

The cost of the mobile internet seems to be getting cheaper, with its demand growing. Sure, there is additional taxes and everything as of recently, but compare mobile internet prices of today to that of a year ago. Or maybe even a month ago. You’ll know. And then, there came the Ncell Fuchhe Pack.  And Ncell, the largest player in the telecommunication sector in Nepal made another splash with its latest data pack offer. It’s new “ Fuchhe Pack ” gives its customers  25 MB of data for a mere amount of Rs.5!  That excludes taxes, but even with it, you get that much of data  for Rs.6.38 . That’s  26\xa0 paisa\xa0 per MB ! You can subscribe for the offer for all 2G, 3G or 4G as well. Of course, the data pack is  only usable in the daytime from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m . and it’s  valid only for 24 hours . So, you can only use the package for once a day…unless you use it up and subscribe to it again within that time frame.   That makes the offer a kind of “not for everyone”, but the way we see it, it’s the best offer for travelers, particularly those who like to upload every little thing on their Instagram or Facebook! If you’re on the road and need to get on the internet, this is as cheap as it can get. Ncell probably made this move as it saw that after the recently added taxes, data usage would go down significantly. Leave it no Ncell to come up with such strategies!        While Ncell does have many other offers for its data packs, this one takes the cake. While NTC also has many such offers, none can compare to this one.

The fingerprint sensor is located at the side of the device, just like on the Sony Xperia smartphones. It also gets a face-unlock, expandable storage, NFC, 15W wireless charging, and a wide antenna bands as well as some pretty standard connectivity options.

All this for just  7999 Yuan or $1168 . Then there is the  7499 Yuan or $1095  model for which you get a six-core i7, GTX 1050Ti and 8GB of RAM.

Xiaomi is also providing a really nice 2666MHz DDR4 RAM variant across the lineup.  Now, these are the next gen Mi Gaming Laptops, with new and improved cooling solutions, definitely a must with this hardware. Xiaomi did this by introducing three exhaust vents on each side of the laptop and eight at the back. Not just that, they have also increased the thickness of the pipes, increased the size of the fans and the motors of the fans itself have also been improved.  These Xiaomi gaming laptops also feature 2 x 3W speakers with Dolby Atmos support, 1.8mm of keyboard key travel with five programmable keys and four backlit color zones. Xiaomi has also managed to fin in 55Wh batteries in these 20.9mm\xa02.7Kg metal bodies.  Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro 2  This one is the successor of last year’s  Mi Notebook Pro . It comes with a 16.9mm footprint which is official ultrabook territory. It does share a lot of design footprints with its predecessor, but with upgraded internals. No, it does not get the six core 45W chipsets, but the four core eight gen i7s are still somewhat of a sizable upgrade over its predecessor.  For this one, because of the size or rather the thinness, it only gets a GTX-1050 Max Q graphics for its top of the line segment, although anything more and we might face some serious throttling. The same 1050 Max Q chip comes paired with an i7-8550U processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 256GB storage all for just  Yuan 7599 or $1115 .  There is also another variant with an i5-8250U processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and the same 1050 GPU. This one is a cool $200 cheaper than the other processor, which is either  Yuan 6299 or $922 . These laptops also come with fingerprint support, a huge 6-inch trackpad, a 1.5mm deep back-lit keyboard (key travel), UHS-II card slot, and a 60Whr battery that supports USB-C fast charging.  Both variants (Gaming and Notebook Pro 2) get the same 15.6-inch display\xa0comes with thin bezels, a nice 81% screen to body ratio according to Xiaomi.\xa0The display resolutions are capped in at FHD, with IPS technology.

However, not all mobiles with requisite specifications come at an affordable price. That’s where Tambo mobiles come in. Tambo mobiles are the new uprising smartphone company in India. It has forayed into the Indian market with 3 new smartphones –\xa0TA 2,\xa0TA 3\xa0and\xa0TA 4\xa0and six feature phones, S2440,\xa0S2430,\xa0A2400,\xa0P1850,\xa0A1810, and\xa0A1800. Now Tambo mobiles have launched in Nepal too with a claim of “ 200 days replacement warranty and 365 days screen replacement warranty on all models “. The brand has today, been launched in Nepal. Other than Nepal, Tambo mobiles are available in India and Nigeria.  The brand has launched in Nepal with budget and feature phones. However, we are unsure about the models launched and the price. What we know is that All Tambo phones that are available in Nepal have features like Full View Display, Facial Recognition, fingerprint sensor, 4G VoLTE, etc and customers can buy Tambo mobiles from retailers and channel partners throughout Nepal from today.         Sudhir Kumar, CEO of Tambo mobiles, at the launch event, shared, “We are happy to introduce Tambo mobile phones in Nepal; Nepali customers will be able to purchase quality mobile phones in reasonable price. The service warranty 200 days replacement and 365 days screen replacement are never-seen-before offer to our customers. We commit to bring phones as per customers interest in the days to come as well”.  With an agenda to deliver delight, design, and durability the company features smartphones at an affordable price. This new company aims to be one of the leading companies and innovate for efficient and affordable smartphones. Also, it mainly focuses on supplying the demand of customers who are looking for either a cheap feature phone or an affordable smartphone that have the prerequisite aspects.      Tambo Smartphones   1  of 2               Tambo Ta 2          Tambo Ta 3                  The phones are categorized as Superphones and Power phones. The distributor unveiled that the price of a Tambo Mobile will start from Rs. 1000. So we can expect that the least expensive handset in the lineup will cost Rs. 1000 to the customer since we cannot any high-end smartphones at this\xa0price. Therefore, the Tambo Mobiles will be competing against brands like  Micromax ,  Colors , and  Lava .  With a number of brands tussling in the smartphone market to market to proper sale, the earlier stages the for the brand may be challenging. However, the mobile brand comes with 200 days replacement warranty and 365 days screen replacement, which might lure the potential customers to opt for the Tambo mobiles.  Since the inclusion of new brands and their new products is obviously exciting as it gives new and more options while buying a phone. So let’s hope that the brand will bring new and feature-packed handsets at the affordable prices so that the users can have maximum delight while using their handsets.  Tambo Mobiles was launched in India in April 2018. The company is all set to enter Nepali market starting the sales from the month of August. Shankaracharya Group has also been appointed as the national distributor of Tambo mobiles in Nepal.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tambo-mobiles-official-nepal.jpg']

The no. 1 smartphone manufacturer in China, may be on its way to being number one in the world soon. It held the number 3 spot for quite some time, but 6 months into 2018, it overtook Apple,  becoming the second largest smartphone seller  in the world. While we all know that Apple just became a 1 trillion dollar company, but lost its position in the global market. This may be bittersweet for Apple, but right now,\xa0Is Huawei on its way to become the top phone manufacturer?  Now, there are so many numbers and statistics at play here and this might not interest you. What you need to know, however, is that Huawei saw  a 40.9% increase in sales  by the 2nd quarter of 2018. So, now, it  occupies 15.8% market share  in the world’s smartphone market, from 11% in 2017. Even with being blocked out of the US citing cybersecurity reasons, they continue to grow. Maybe that itself is one of the reasons for its rise? Maybe, because its popularity is increasing in the Asian and European markets.         The reason may be a modification of the designs, the introduction of some new innovative features and being a bit more affordable than the likes of Apple and Samsung. Huawei’s flagships feature specs that can compete with that of Apple and Samsung’s. Combine that with innovative approaches like the triple camera of the P20 Pro, and you have a hit. Also, all that is available for slightly lesser prices than that of Samsung’s high-end flagships.  However,  Samsung still takes the lead  with 20.9% market share globally. But that being said, Samsung is losing its share, and has gone down by 10.4% than last years’. Its flagships, the  Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ saw quite slow sales . Granted that they still remain unbeaten in aspects like display, but that doesn’t seem enough for consumers. So, they might be launching the Galaxy Note 9 a bit earlier, before other companies release their flagships this year. They might be the top players, but we cannot be certain for how long.   And on this side, Huawei is more optimistic than ever. They forecast more than 200 million sales by the end of 2018, and boast they  might become the top sellers by the end of 2019 . Also, with Samsung’s declining market share, this is quite possible. This is a difference, we are seeing even in Nepal.  The streets of New Road which used to be full of “Samsung” billboards, are now replaced with Chinese brands  like Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo. Huawei is coming up with great phones in the mid-range sector like  Nova 3i  and in the high-end sector like  Nova 3 , in addition to their flagships and expanding their Honor series as well. In addition, they might be integrating specs rumored to be available in Next year’s Samsung’s flagships into their rumored flagship, the Mate 20 series. This, if it happens, will clearly set them apart.  What are your thoughts on Huawei’s phones? Do you think they should be at the top? Or do you feel someone else should be there?

And if you do ask why should you buy one of these? Well, these phones pack serious AI features. For starters, real-time voice translations up to 17 international languages (according to some sources); and they, apparently, can “talk” to its users. Also, you have WiFi, dual-SIM, and infrared zappers as well.         Out of the two models, the Qin 1s is the more powerful one.

Huawei P20 Pro Specifications:   Display : 6.1-inch full HD+ (1080 x 2240 pixels) OLED display, 18.7:9 aspect ratio  CPU : Octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 970  OS : Android Oreo (v8.1) with EMUI 8.1 on the top  RAM : 6 GB  GPU : Mali-G72 MP12  Storage : 128 GB  Rear Camera : 40 MP with f/1.8 aperture + 20 MP with f/1.6 aperture + 8 MP with f/2.4 aperture, Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), up to 5x Hybrid Zoom, PDAF, LED flash  Front Camera : 24 MP front-facing camera, f/2.0 aperture  Sensors : Fingerprint, Accelerometer, Gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:\xa0 Dual SIM with 4G  IP67 Dust and Water Resistant  Battery : 4,000 mAh with Fast Charging Support  Price : Rs. 99,900   Design and display  When I first saw the P20 pro, I instantly fell in love with the Twilight version and undoubtedly, this is something that has made the device stand out. For me, this is the most appealing color any smartphone has till now.   Sure, you have the notch sitting on top. But you also have an option to remove the notch and I think the phone looks good that way because it makes the bezels look even. But it’s totally your choice. I like the idea of a button/ scanner at the bottom. It’s the fingerprint sensor and a single button working as the home key and navigation button.   I found it interesting because it works according to your gestures, for example, you need to hold for going back to home screen, tap to go back and swipe to get to recently used apps. All this gives a different feel to the device and it’s totally fun to use.   The fingerprint sensor resides at the front & is very very quick in response but I found myself using facial unlock because of its swiftness and accuracy.  Something you will notice is that the device does not have a headphone jack. However, you get headphones in the case and you are supposed to plug it in through the Type-C charging port and I didn’t quite mind doing so.   On hands, yes the P20 Pro is a huge phone but it’s amazing that the device is very easy to carry. By looks, it may seem slippery but it I never had troubles with this one because it just fits right in your hands meaning that its easier to have a strong grip on the phone.  I used this phone without any phone case or display protector. The screen surprisingly does not have a lot of scratches to it. However, I wished the same about the back. In two months’ time, there were slight scratches and marks around the edges but the glossy finish makes the scratches appear less.  Display wise, the 6.1-inch 1080p AMOLED display produces accurate colors and viewing angles is excellent. Though it’s not 2K like the Galaxy S9+,\xa0but the display is crisp, vibrant, and bright. It is the display we would expect on a flagship and it has one that is really good.   With a darker theme, the OLED screen provides good contrast and black level. Similarly, you can adjust the color temperature as per your liking but I found the natural tone to be better.  Cameras  Huawei had made headlines with the Leica branded triple cameras and the fact that DXO has rated its camera with an outshining  109 score  makes it even more appealing. One thing I noticed in all the pictures taken from this device is that the photos pack in abundant details. Now, I am talking about a lot of details and sharp pictures.      Huawei P20 Pro | Day Light Samples   1  of 14                                                                       rptnb                                     Normal Mode                                                      In the normal mode, the colors in pictures are great, you get vibrant pictures with no chance of shaky images and shutter speed\xa0and autofocus is unbelievably high. There is a 3x optical zoom or a hybrid 5x zoom. However, you cannot zoom in through the 40 MP sensor while taking photos but that’s okay because the results are decent with great details.  You have an option to change the resolution from 40 to 10 or 7 MP but I recommend you use the 10 MP option because I found it to have a better dynamic range and color saturation compared to the 40MP photos.      Huawei P20 Pro | 40MP Vs 10MP Shooter    1  of 2                40MP          10MP                  Another thing worth noticing is about the Master AI. Now, I know that it is with all the right intentions that Huawei has included the AI option but there is still room for improvement in this area. There are things that AI des really well, for example, identifying scenery or sky or objects accurately. But what it adds to the normal pictures is an added punch to it. It tends to make the pictures a little more saturated and sharp, especially the ones that it recognized as sky or greenery. But the good news is that you can always disable it and get back to natural settings, which I found myself doing most of the times.      Huawei P20 Pro | Ai Vs Normal Mode    1  of 2               P20 Pro AI Mode         P20 Pro Normal Mode                   Adding to the camera setting options is the Night mode. The reason I am mentioning it separately is that the night mode does a commendable job preserving details in low light. The colors seem better and there is less noise in the pictures because it takes a long exposure shot that takes 6 seconds to capture a picture. Well, after the 6-second wait, you get very clean low light shots. What you have to keep in mind is that the night mode can only be used to take pictures of still objects.      Huawei P20 Pro | Normal Mode Vs Night Mode   1  of 2               Normal Mode         Night Mode                  There’s also pro mode that uses AI and automatically adjusts ISO, shutter speed, which is extremely convenient, at least for me.  Like the back camera, the 24 MP selfie camera also reproduces a smooth skin tone and I must say that the selfies are very sharp. Sometimes, when the environment is very bright, you might get overexposed images. But all in all, I have liked the selfie camera because I have actually got quite good selfies from this one.      Huawei P20 Pro | Selfie Samples   1  of 5                                                                    Now moving on to the video department, the videos are stabilized and are of superb quality with a good amount of details. However, 4k videos have lesser stabilization than 1080p videos. So, it’s better you use the 1080P option.\xa0 Also while taking videos from the beauty mode, the camera automatically decreases the quality to 720p, which well, is not fair.  Similarly, there are a lot of camera settings which may be confusing for some people as you have to dig in all of those,\xa0tweak in and out of different settings which may be a hassle for some. So, all in all, the cameras are exceptional as hyped.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Performance\xa0\xa0  What’s holding the phone inside is the powerful Kirin 970 chipset coupled with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal memory. Sorry, no SD card slot here, but I think 128GB is more than enough.  Now back to the processor, we know that the Kirin 970 is not something new, it had been used in the Mate 10 pro last year. The performance of the chipset is good no doubts but Huawei could have opted for the Snapdragon 845 which is the latest and certainly shows better benchmark results.   In real-world usage, it shows flawless performance in terms of multitasking and gameplay. For example, I played one of the graphics demanding game PUBG and it ran with minimum hiccups. Likewise, other high-end games too ran very smoothly.  The back of the phone rises in temperature but not to the extent of worry or frustration. In the August update, Huawei is introducing the  GPU Turbo  feature in the P20 Pro which as Huawei claims is going to boost the GPU performance. Having known that the GPU performs good enough, with the new update what does Huawei have in the bag for users will be known then.  Software  On to the software, I must say that Huawei’s UI has gotten better with time and it’s actually pleasing to use. There are different theme options and you will never get bored of what’s there.      Huawei P20 Pro | Software UI    1  of 5                                                                    I am a Samsung user, but the EMUI on the P20 pro has got be impressed. Like most other flagships, Huawei has also tried to give many features to the users, there is battery optimization features, there is knuckle gesture features, there are a lot of display settings, you can enable or disable the notch which are all good to know and I don’t mind having them on my device. During my time of use, there was one update I got on the device. But I expected more for some reason.  Battery  The Huawei P20 pro has a massive 4,000 mAh battery and complementing this battery size is Huawei’s own Supercharge feature. The device gave a full two days of usage on a single charge even on extensive use.   Also, it’s not powering a 2k display so you get a longer life but if put in comparison with the S9 and iPhone X, Huawei certainly has a lead on this one. The battery life is very impressive and other flagship manufactures need to learn a lesson from this.  Conclusion  So, yes. What do I think about the Huawei P20 Pro as a whole? I would say that it is the perfect Huawei device. I mean among the others Huawei has produced till now, this one is the best offering. And if you will get the P20 pro, it will surely be for the cameras.   Yes, the camera’s interface and the AI need a little reworking but those can be fixed in an update, so no worries. The performance is powerful and in my time of use, this device has never let me down. So, would I recommend this device? I would say yes. This device is a package for photography enthusiasts and people looking to get a worthy flagship.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Huawei-P20-Pro-Review.jpg']

Namely known as the  Moto G6 series and Moto E5 Series , the smartphones failed to make an impact in terms of sales. However, the smartphone brand is not giving up on bringing the new phones. The smartphone maker recently announced the Motorola Moto Z3 with quite an ambitious dream. During the announcement, Motorola stated that the Moto Z3 would be the world’s first smartphone to be upgradeable to the  5G technology . The company has the plan to bring Moto Mod, which would fit with the handset and would add the 5G connectivity when the technology launches in 2019.  In terms of display, the Moto Z3 comes with the 6.01-inch display. The display on the handset uses a Super AMOLED panel so the display will surely look vibrant with deeper blacks and brighter whites. The display on the handset features a Full-HD+ resolution in the 18:9 aspect ratio contributing to a pixel density of 402PPI. To ensure the safety of the screen from cracks and scratches during the falls, the display has been shielded with the Corning Gorilla Glass 3.         Being the flagship handset from the company, the smartphone comes equipped with the  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset . The processor is powerful and the performance is reliable, however, despite being the flagship of 2018, the smartphone still uses a year old processor. But for the price tag it carries, that is understandable. The smartphone has also been provided with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage alongside. There is also a facility of the expansion of memory using the SD card and a dedicated slot has been provided for the purpose.  On the camera front, the Motorola Moto Z3 sports  dual camera setup  at the back. There is a primary camera of 12MP backed by another secondary camera of 12MP. The secondary camera provided on the handset possesses a Black and White Sensor so the users can get top quality monochrome images when in need. On the front side, there is an 8MP camera for taking selfies and for video calling.   There is also the side mounted fingerprint sensor, which has reduced the chin bezels to great extent. Another interesting feature on the smartphone is its splash and dust resistant body. However, it is not IP certified. The package of the Motorola Moto Z3 has been fueled by a 3000mAh battery. To reduce the charging time, the smartphone is provided with the fast charging feature, which injects 15W power into the device’s battery and speeds up charging process. Also, the 5G Moto Mod will have a 2000mAh battery and when used together, the 5000mAh battery combo provides a prolonged battery backup.  The big thing with the Motorola Moto Z3 is not its fancy design, sleek body, vibrant Super AMOLED display or the old yet powerful processor. The big thing with the Moto Z3 is its promise to provide 5G connectivity in the handset when the technology starts to roll out. The smartphone maker has promised that it will release a 5G Moto Mod in 2019 when the 5G technology gets started which when connected with the smartphone showers the smartphone with 5G connectivity.

['Blackberry Evolve and Evolve X Launched – Evolving? Not really'],['Blackberry'],['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['August 3, 2018']",2018-08-03 10:22:49+00:00,"['Blackberry , the smartphone company that has seen better days, is still trying hard. With the Key Note 2 just behind them, they’ve launched their new series of smartphones – without the physical Qwerty keyboards. Blackberry and its Indian manufacturing counterpart announced the Evolve series which includes two new phones, called Blackberry Evolve and Blackberry Evolve X.  Both the phones have tall screens, dual cameras and pack a large battery of 4000 mAh, but what else is their selling point?         The Blackberry Evolve is the more affordable option of the two. It features a 5.99″ IPS LCD display with a Full HD+ resolution of (1080 x 2160) pixels. Dual cameras of 13 MP + 13 MP with Samsung’s S5K3L8 sensors are the back while the selfie camera is a 16 MP up front.\xa0The camera does feature HDR imaging. As mentioned, the battery is a whopping 4000 mAh, but with a processor like Snapdragon 450, it seems like a letdown. The low-end chipset does mean very good battery life, but that’s about it. It does have a 4 GB RAM, which is okay, but the modest processor just doesn’t do it.  The  Evolve X  is better of the duo, but not by much. Most of the things stay the same including the display. While the primary camera setup is  12 MP + 13 MP , the selfie camera stays the same  16 MP  too, but it probably doesn’t have the HDR feature. The difference is the  6 GB RAM  it comes in, and a\xa0 much powerful\xa0 Snapdragon 660  chipset.   Both the phones have a Type-C charger, both compatible with  Quick Charge 3.0 . Both of them come with  64 GB internal storage  and are expandable up to 256 GB via microSD. Also, these include front flash as well, but there’s not much to it.

Ironically, the phones are named Evolve, but, with specs like these, are they really evolving? The price looks like that of mid-range phones, but specs say otherwise. I mean, for the price, you should be able to get a bit more value!  And with their launch in India, there’s a chance they will make their way here, too. What do you think of these “evolving” phones? Would you buy these phones if they come here? Do let us know.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Blackberry-Evolve-and-Evolve-X-launched.png']
['Samsung Galaxy A6+ Review: All about the camera'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['August 3, 2018']",2018-08-03 09:27:25+00:00,"['The recently launched  Samsung Galaxy A6+  (Rs. 45,000) is neither a typical midrange smartphone nor it’s a high-end flagship. So, who is this smartphone for? With so many options available around 30,000 price bracket, is it worth cashing in extra for the A6+? Let’s find out in the Galaxy A6+ review here.   Specs Overview | Samsung Galaxy A6+   6-inch (1080 x\xa02220 pixels) FHD+ Super AMOLED 18.5:9 Infinity Display  Metal body  Snapdragon\xa0450 SoC  1.8GHz Octa-Core 14nm Cortex A53 CPU  Adreno 506 GPU  4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, expandable memory up to 256GB with microSD  Dual SIM (4G + 4G)  Android 8.0 (Oreo) with Experience UI  16MP rear camera with LED flash, f/1.7 aperture, LED flash, 5MP secondary rear camera with f/1.9 aperture  24MP front-facing camera with f/1.9 aperture, LED flash  Dimensions:\xa0 160.2 x 75.7 x 7.9 mm; Weight: 191g  Fingerprint sensor  Samsung Pay Mini  3.5mm audio jack, Dolby Atmos  4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (2.4/5GHz), HT40, Bluetooth 4.2 LE,\xa0GPS  3500mAh battery (no fast charging)   Cameras  The Samsung Galaxy A6+ is equipped with the Dual rear cameras — 16MP\xa0 sensor with f/1.7 aperture and a 5MP with f/1.9 aperture.        The camera is excellent and captures still photos with great details and sharpness. They are also well-saturated, have quite a bit of dynamic range and the colors are natural as well. The low light photos also turn out to be decent with good saturation.      Samsung Galaxy A6 Plus | Back Camera Samples   1  of 6                                                                              The same goes for the portrait pictures as the secondary depth-sensing 5MP camera reads the subjects well to blur out the borders effectively. Also, just like in every other Samsung smartphone with dual cameras, it too has the adjustable blur feature, before and after taking pictures.      Samsung Galaxy A6+ | Portrait Samples   1  of 2                                      When Samsung had launched the  Galaxy S9 (Read review) , I was disappointed with Samsung’s decision to not focus heavily on the selfie camera. However, Samsung has seemed to listen to everyone’s comments as the Galaxy A6+ comes with a top quality 24-megapixel front facing camera that shoots photos that have a lot of sharpness and details embedded in.      Samsung Galaxy A6+ | Selfie Samples   1  of 3                                                Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Design  Another thing I liked about the A6+ is the premium design. This device is made of high-quality aluminum unibody and boy it feels good on hands. It has a right heft to it while holding it and the seamless back is an eye candy.   I am also happy to see Samsung include all the three slots instead of choosing the hybrid option. As expected, the call quality on the 4G network on both NTC and Ncell is top notch. There is a speaker right above the power button which is very loud and clear. The audio quality from the 3.5mm headphone jack also has respectable performance.   Display  On the front, the Galaxy A6+ features a tall 6-inch Full-HD+ display. Now, Samsung has mentioned the term ‘Infinity’ on the box of the Galaxy A6+, but without the presence of a curved display or very minimal bezels, and if you think it’s going to be similar to the S9 Plus, you might be disappointed by the term “Infinity”.   Quality wise, Super AMOLED panel on the device is vivid with deep blacks. It is also super bright and easily usable on a bright sunny day. The touch is very responsive and kudos to Samsung in using a quality display here.  Software  In the software department, the Experience is typical of what you would expect from Samsung phones. Obviously, it’s not stock, so you do get a fair share of bloatware.   However, I liked the inclusion of S-health and the Samsung Themes. Samsung has also included Always on Display which is a welcome addition considering you don’t get a notification LED.      Samsung Galaxy A6+ | Software UI   1  of 7                                                                                        Performance  The area where A6+ has failed to live up to the price is on the performance front. The “mediocre” at best Snapdragon 450 processor is usually seen on devices that sell for a relatively low price. If you compare it with  Oppo F7 (Read review)  or the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI (Read review) , the A6+ falls short by a good margin.  On to the real-time performance, using light apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram is smooth and you won’t feel the lag. But, it’s not blazingly fast, and apps opening takes a little bit of time. The good thing is there was no major throttling going on and you won’t experience heating after long chatting session.  As for gaming, low-end to mid-tier games are playable at respectable frame rates, but you will notice occasional frame drops while playing high-end games and you will get better gaming phones with better frame rates below this price tag. So, if you are into performance and gaming, you should be looking somewhere else.  Sensors  Well, talking about the sensor, you do get a snappy fingerprint sensor along with the face unlock which also gets the job done. There’s also a gyro sensor for those interested in Virtual Reality.  Battery  What has impressed me is the 3,500 mAh battery which easily lasts for a day and a half under heavy usage. The drawback, however, is that it takes a while to juice up. With no fast charging, the stock charger takes around 3 hours to charge.   I use the S9 Plus as my daily driver and I am used to fast charging, so waiting for 3 hours to get fully charged on A6+ was frustrating at times. But, if you are not used to fast charging, it won’t bother you much.  Conclusion  The Galaxy A6+ is Samsung’s answer to the growing number of Chinese smartphones that have started dominating the mid-range market. With this device, Samsung has fallen short on the performance front, as it underperforms for what it is worth. But it does make up for it with superb cameras – both front and back, outstanding battery life, stunning design, and top-quality display. So, if you are not much of a performance geek, you should definitely give the Galaxy A6+ a look.

['Samsung Launches New Galaxy Tab S4: A laptop wannabe?'],"['Samsung', 'Tablet']",['By Johnson Shrestha -  '],"['August 2, 2018']",2018-08-02 14:27:40+00:00,"['The smart tablet market has been dwindling for some time, yet it hasn’t stopped companies from coming out with newer tabs. And so, Samsung has released a successor to its last years Galaxy Tab S3, with quite a few improvements – in about almost all aspects. The new one is called Samsung Galaxy Tab S4, and its set to be Samsung’s greatest in its tablet lineup. But with its features, it looks like Samsung is heading towards an Android laptop!  Compared to last year’s  Galaxy Tab S3 , the Galaxy Tab S4 is bigger, more powerful, has bigger storage, better camera…well, you get the picture. First off, you’ll notice its bigger screen, with  seriously thin bezels ! The design is glass front and back, with a metal frame. It features a  10.5″ AMOLED display  with  2560 x 1600 resolution  in a 16:10 aspect ratio. It seems Samsung’s done everything to maximize your media consumption experience, bringing in last year’s  AKG’s Quad-speakers , this time, with improved Dolby Atmos surround sound support.         The primary camera stays the same at  13 MP  and it’s 4K video recording enabled. The  front camera is now 8 MP , which can record Full-HD videos. The highly slim bezels mean no more fingerprint sensors, as the tablet unlocks with Facial recognition, combined with Iris Scanner. I think that the fingerprint sensor would’ve been more convenient…but maybe Samsung decided to jump on the trend.  Also Read:  Samsung Tablets Price in Nepal  Inside, a  Snapdragon 835 chipset   with  4 GB RAM  powers the tablet, and it should be good enough. Storage options have improved, with the baseline model being 64 GB. A microSD card option is always there, but you can also get the 256 GB model as well. You can also choose between a SIM-variant or a normal one as well, depending on your needs.   But what makes this tablet close to a laptop is its Dex-enabled! You can get a laptop experience on it with keyboards, monitors, and everything, but it does fall short of a real laptop. Yes, you can simply plug it into your Dex, and voila! You have an Android laptop. The Dex can also let you connect a monitor, improving your workspace. And since you can connect a wireless mouse to it easily, it’s more like a desktop experience than a\xa0 tablet one. Also, the S-Pen adds more to the experience, by making the navigation smoother and easier. With Microsoft apps pre-installed on it, it’s clear that this is designed for commuters and to make you more productive in a sense.  Also Read:  Samsung Mobiles Price in Nepal  The Galaxy Tab S3 cost around Rs.83,500 in Nepal when it came out. And this one, by the looks of it, might be more expensive!

We also get that most people really don’t bother playing games on a PC let alone a console. So for that reason, we will be focusing on the most popular platform for playing games, that being Google Android.  Also Read:\xa0 The Most Popular Mobile Games Downloaded Over the Years  So, let’s look at some of the best Android games, new games, and games that have a special part in our hearts. The rankings are in random order so, do not take any offence if your favourite games happen to be at the bottom of the list.        1. PUBG Mobile  Pretty much one of the best game on the Play store\xa0right now, a perfect combination of great gameplay and some realistic at the same time awesome graphics. It’s not as good as on PC, but it’s also free so there is that. It’s basically a toned down version of the PC, although EPIC has really managed to do a fantastic job of retaining the actual gameplay from the PC version.   “100 players parachute onto a remote 8×8 km island for a winner-takes-all showdown. Players have to locate and scavenge their own weapons, vehicles and supplies, and defeat every player in a graphically and tactically rich battleground that forces players into a shrinking play zone. Get ready to land, loot, and do whatever it takes to survive and be the last man standing!” –  PUBG Mobile Playstore description.  Download PUBG here for free  2. Asphalt 9  Everyone didn’t go as nuts for this game as one would have thought. The game even went live a full day ahead of its schedule which did affect it’s overall first-day download numbers. Well, let’s just say it’s not really much of a big deal as it already has more than a million download already. The game, I felt was a bit worse than before, but then again, the fun hasn’t stopped.   “The gameplay in Asphalt 9 is similar to\xa0 Asphalt 8: Airborne , with noticeable differences in graphics and design. There are 48 cars for players to collect, all of which are extremely prestigious.\xa0 Just like in the previous games, there are five classes: D, C, B, A, and S. All cars in the game now require “blueprints” to unlock and level up. To add on, a new car editor is in the game. There are also “clubs,” where you can make a community of players, and achieve rewards.” –  Asphalt 9 Wikipedia Page.  Download Asphalt 9 here for free  3. Alto’s Odyssey  This one is one of my favourites as well, with a pretty relaxing gameplay experience. It’s a simple game with literally one input method, but you will find yourself doing so much with just that. The gameplay along with the mysteries that you go on unlocking, the graphics itself and most importantly the background music is such a nice combination. You just have to actually play it once to just know what I am babbling about.   “Just beyond the horizon sits a majestic desert, vast and unexplored.\xa0Join Alto and his friends and set off on an endless sandboarding journey to discover its secrets. Soar above windswept dunes, traverse thrilling canyons and explore long-hidden temples in a fantastical place far from home. Along the way, you’ll grind across vines, bounce atop hot air balloons, ride towering rock walls, and escape mischievous lemurs – all while uncovering the desert’s many mysteries.” –  Alto’s Odyssey Play Store Description  Download Alto’s Odyssey here for free  4. Fifa Soccer  Fifa Soccer is as the name suggests a football game. I did get addicted to the FIFA 14 on Android for a brief period, but it’s been a dry spell for a while now until EA finally decided to launch another FIFA for Android, the FIFA Soccer. It’s still not perfect, I mean it doesn’t even get a simple kick off mode, so you will be training for a while before you can get any sort of real action (It’s not actually long, it just feels like an eternity). Nevertheless, I would really recommend football fans to try this out once.   “Develop the most competitive squad when you choose any 11 players from over 550 real teams, including stars from past and present, and train them to over 100 OVR. Add depth to your roster, manage your lineup on the fly, and quickly tweak tactics before every match. Make the right calls and watch your club become the Ultimate Team.” –  Fifa Soccer Playstore Description  Download Fifa Soccer here for free  5. Minecraft  Arguably one of the best games of all times, if you take your time and learn the game through. It doesn’t actually boast the highest number of downloads that’s more because it’s a paid game rather than a free one. The $7.49 is a hefty price tag for an Android game, maybe just download a cracked .apk first and see if you actually like the game or not. If you give it enough time, you will actually learn to see what the game is actually all about.   “Explore infinite worlds and build everything from the simplest of homes to the grandest of castles. Play in creative mode with unlimited resources or mine deep into the world in survival mode, crafting weapons and armour to fend off dangerous mobs. Create, explore and survive alone or with friends on mobile devices or Windows 10.” –  Minecraft Playstore Description  Download Minecraft here for $7.49']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BEST-GAMES-ON-ANDROID.jpg']

Why pre-order you ask? Well, you are getting a free portable printer on the Nova 3 and a portable speaker on the Nova 3i. You will also get a pretty nice smartphone for the money you are paying, and if these phones were on your buying list, pre-ordering is a no-brainer.  You can also pre-book it from this  link here . You do need to pay Rs 3000 upfront to pre-book\xa0your shiny new smartphone, which started from July 28 and will go on till August 12.

The performance from the Nova 3i’s Kirin 710 should match any smartphone with an  Helio P60  or  Snapdragon 660 . For instance, the  Oppo F7  and the  Nokia 7 Plus  already delivers similar performance to the Nova 3i.        The Nova 3 on the other hand sports a Kirin 970, which is the same as their flagship  Huawei P20 Pro . The performance on this one is comparable to  Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset , found on a few last-gen flagships like the  Galaxy S8  and  Pixel 2XL .  I am not saying the performance will be comparable, but it does show some signs of how they might perform. It will most possibly improve with every update, and we are yet to actually test out the GPU Turbo technology, which should also be very interesting.  You can also expect a nice set of cameras, which has been a key selling point for Huawei devices for quite some time now. Not to mention these two smartphones not only look good but also felt equally good in my hands. Particularly, the Iris Purple color which looks really awesome in my opinion.

['Huawei Honor Note 10 is now official: A tall phablet with flagship specs'],['Huawei'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['August 1, 2018']",2018-07-31 18:28:44+00:00,"['With the trend of the bezel-less and  near bezel-less displays , the concept of the phablet seemed slowly fading away. The shrunk bezels provided space for the extension in the display without a nasty increase in size. So we could barely see phablets making up to the market these days. However, Huawei seems to be unruffled with the trend. So it decided to rejuvenate its popular phablet series namely known as the Huawei Honor Note series. And after two years of pause, Huawei added a new member in its Honor Note series lineup. The newbie, also known as the Huawei Honor Note 10 comes with a giant display, big battery, powerful processor, a wonderful set of cameras, and many other exciting features.  Display  On the display side, the phablet comes with a giant 7-inch display, 6.95-inch to be precise. And with the Full HD+ resolution, the content on the screen will fare out really well. But it definitely is sad to see Huawei’s decision to downgrade from Quad HD resolution on the Honor Note 8 to Full HD+ in the Honor Note 10. Nonetheless, the newbie boasts an AMOLED display, which will produce deeper blacks and brighter whites so color will pop out pretty well. On the top, the display also supports HDR 10 and 115% of NTSC color gamut. So despite the higher resolution, we might not even miss the display on Note 8 at all.         The phablet does not just look appealing because of its all glass on the front and on the back and because of its narrow bezels, the more is due to the absence of the infamous notch. The contagious concept of the notch started by the  Essential PH-1 phone  and  iPhone X  spread like the wildfire in the smartphone world. But Huawei discarded the concept of the notch on the Honor Note 10. And this attribute on the handset has garnered tremendous attention in the fan base.  Software and Performance  On the software side, the Note 10 comes with Android Oreo out of the box with EMUI 8.2 on the top. And on the performance front, the handset is furnished with the Huawei’s Hisilicon Kirin 970 chipset with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM alongside. Even on the storage side, there are two options you can choose from, one with 64GB of internal memory and another with 128GB of onboard storage. There is also a slot for the memory expansion. However, the users will be obliged to sacrifice the dual SIM functionality due to the hybrid nature of the slot.  The most interesting feature on the Huawei Honor Note 10 is the liquid cooling solution, which will be used by the chipset to cool down the temperature. The maker calls the technology as “the nine” as it consists of 8 layers of dissipation and a ninth one which is basically a PC-grade liquid-cooled pipe. This technique promises a 41% better heat management, which implies 10 °C lower temperatures under load. If the information is true, the handset will surely remain calm and cool even after prolonged high-end gaming sessions.   And needless to mention that the Huawei Honor Note 10 supports the  GPU Turbo tech , which Huawei claims to provide a boost in performance mostly in the gaming scenario. Not just the GPU Turbo tech, the handset also welcomes the new CPU Turbo technology. So with the software monitoring and control, the performance will be enhanced in the Dual Turbo Mode. And the good thing is that the feature can be accessed with a press of the dedicated hardware button on the bottom.  Camera and Battery  Even in the camera department, the Huawei Honor Note 10 is well suited up to compete against the popular handset available. The phablet comes with 16MP, f/1.8 camera backed by another 24MP B/W, f/1.8 camera at the back. Up front, there is a 13MP shooter to help the users in taking selfies and for video calling. All the processes inside the device are fueled up with a whopping 5000mAh battery. And to cut down the charging time, the handset also comes with Super Charge technology to juice up the battery faster.   Price and Availability  Even in terms of pricing, the Honor Note 10 does not disappoint. The base variant or the one with 6GB RAM and 64GB of onboard storage comes with a price tag of CNY 2,799 ($409). The variant with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage comes at an expense of CNY 3,199 ($468) whereas the premium or the powerful variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage will demand a price of CNY 3,599 ($527).   The phablet is available in two color variants: Midnight Black and Phantom Blue and it is already on for pre-order in China. However, the actual shipments will get started from August 1.

The  Kirin 970  powered Nova 3 is sure to lure a lot of buyers, with it’s AI capabilities, new GPU Turbo technology, and a really nice set of cameras. Other features include a huge battery, good storage options, some really nice eye candy color variants, and an IR face unlock feature. Let’s find out more about the specs, updated price, and availability of Huawei Nova 3 in Nepal.   Huawei Nova 3 Overview  The Nova 3 sports a 6.3-inch IPS LCD, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The exact ratio was something rare at the time of the release but it has since been adopted by many mid-rangers alike. The panel comes with an FHD+ resolution and thanks to the with 3D double curved glass on both sides, it is easy to hold and isn’t slippery. There is also a notch on top, which for some reason people can’t get enough of. The device does come with a LED notification light but it rests behind the headpiece grill which doesn’t make it that useful in the daily usage.         Performance and Memory  The Kirin 970 SoC comes from Huawei’s in-house HiSilicon factory, the same processor used on their flagship  Huawei P20 Pro . The Mali G72 MP12 takes care on the GPU front aided by the GPU Turbo technology. In our review, we didn’t face any lag in day to day usage. Even games like Asphalt 9 and Injustice 2 ran smoothly without any stutter. However, it does heat a little with games like PUBG in HD graphics and a high refresh rate. You also get 6GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage options, with SD card support that uses the second SIM slot.  Camera  The Nova 3 comes with two cameras on the back, 24 MP f/1.8+ 16 MP f/1.8. Even without a depth sensor, the bokeh effect comes out decent except under low light conditions. Normal shots are over-saturated and colors don’t look natural. It is also capable of 4k video recording up to 30fps and 1080p@60fps. The front also gets a dual camera treatment with a 24+2 MP setup. The 2MP here has been employed for better depth detection so the selfie portraits are decent.   The fingerprint sensor is mounted at the rear alongside the dual cameras. Other sensors include an accelerometer, proximity, Gyro, and compass. It also has a huge 3750mAH battery, no complaints here. Finally, it runs on Android Oreo 8.1 with EMUI 8.2 on top.

The Korean smartphone giant has been aggressively launching the smartphones in a quick succession. Samsung brought the  Galaxy J2 2018  and  Galaxy J4  in the budget section. It also brought  Galaxy J7 Duo  and  Galaxy J6  in the lower midrange section,  Galaxy A6, A6+ , and  Galaxy A8 plus  in the premium mid-range section. All these smartphones were launch in a very quick succession.  And we recently came to know that Samsung started implementing the  shotgun strategy  to beat the growing dominance of Chinese smartphones in the smartphone world. And Nepal has not been an exception in that respect. Samsung has brought all the smartphones to Nepal, which has been launched in the international arena. And this time, Samsung Nepal has launched yet another mid-range phone. Namely known as the Samsung Galaxy J8, the newbie boasts a  dual camera setup  at the back and an infinity display upfront.         Overview  In terms of display, the Galaxy J8 comes with a 6-inch Super AMOLED display. With the narrow bezels on the top and on the bottom, Samsung likes to like to call the display on the handset an infinity display. The display on the handset features an HD+ resolution in an 18.5:9 aspect ratio.   Powering the J8 is a Snapdragon 450 chipset with 4GB of RAM alongside. Talking about the internal storage, the smartphone boasts an ample onboard storage of 64GB. Samsung also accommodated a dedicated SD card slot for the expansion of memory to those who are not yet satisfied with the amount of memory initially provided.   The camera is the major highlight on the Samsung Galaxy J8. The smartphone comes with the dual camera setup consisting of 16MP and 5MP sensors. Among the two, the primary 16MP camera musters the subject details whereas the secondary 5MP camera garners the depth information. When the information from both the sensors is merged, users can get an appealing portrait shot with a background blurring effect. Samsung has this feature as a Live Focus option in the camera. On capturing the image with this feature, users can get a Bokeh effect, whose blur intensity and focus area can be readjusted even after capturing the images.   Not just at the back, the Galaxy J8 sports a fancy camera even at the front. The smartphone encompasses a 16MP camera crafted in the forehead of the device. Along with the normal selfies, the handset also delivers some appealing and social media ready portrait selfies.  In the battery front, the Galaxy J8 enjoys a substantial 3500mAh battery. With the HD+ display and an underpowered chipset, the smartphone is supposed to provide 2 days’ backup on the normal use.

Not just the smartphones from other brands, Samsung has its own  Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo  and  Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro , which comes at a lower price than the J8 but it offers greater value for money.  So what do you think of the Samsung Galaxy J8? Is the phone worth the price? If not then which smartphone do you think as the best handset at a similar price bracket?

Corning has been a top name when it comes to display protection. Today, Corning has come up with another version of Gorilla Glass, which is its sixth version! The Corning Gorilla 6, as said by the engineers, has better resistance to falls and better survives drops.  Further, sources add that the Gorilla Glass 6 can withstand twice as many drops as the Gorilla Glass 5. How it is done is by its new glass that has a different chemical composition than Gorilla Glass 5’s. Hence, because of that composition, the company claims that the new version can withstand more than Gorilla Glass 5.         During tests, this sixth version of Gorilla Glass is said to have survived 15 drops from the distance of 1 meter before breaking. Thus, claims are that it is made from a completely re-engineered process, which makes it easier to increase the level of compression.  “Corning Gorilla Glass 6 improves upon Gorilla Glass 5 by surviving drops from higher heights, but, more importantly, has been engineered to survive multiple drops. This enables the Gorilla Glass 6 to be more resistant to damage.,” -John Bayne (Corning Gorilla Glass vice president and general manager).  According to sources, Corning Gorilla has been designed into more than 6 Billion devices by more than 45 brands.  However, this new version of Gorilla Glass is in production now and it is being evaluated by multiple customers. After the tests will be over, it may take several months for it to be out in the market.  About Corning Gorilla Glass  Corning Gorilla Glass was launched in September 2011. Since its establishment, it has been used by many companies as their choice for device manufacturers all over the world.

['Nokia X5 goes official: Notched display and a dual camera on a budget'],"['HMD Global', 'Nokia']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['July 18, 2018']",2018-07-18 13:00:18+00:00,"['Since 2017, we have seen almost all the smartphone brands following the bandwagon of slimming the bezels. Since removing the bezels altogether had been a bigger challenge in the smartphone industry, most of the smartphone brands are opting to leave a notch to adjust the front camera, earpiece, and other necessary sensors. Started by  Essential PH-1 phone  and seconded by the  iPhone X , this trend spread like a wildfire. And Nokia seems to be pretty much impressed with this concept in the recent days. A few months back, Nokia revealed the  Nokia X6 , which had a notch on its display. With a view to expanding its X-series, this time Nokia launched the Nokia X5 aka Nokia 5.1 Plus, which too comes with a notched display and  dual camera setup  at the back.   Nokia X5 comes in an all-alluring body in a thickness of 8mm and weighing 160 grams. The handset comes with an adorable 5.86-inch display with an infamous notch on the top. The notch is slightly wider than what we see on the Nokia X6, however, the region for this notch expansion has not yet been divulged. Talking about the resolution, the Nokia 5.1 Plus features an HD+ resolution in 19:9 aspect ratio.         Powering the phone is a  MediaTek Helio P60 chipset  accompanied by either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. Helio P60 is a powerful yet power efficient chipset, which can also be found on the  Oppo F7 ,  Oppo F7 Youth , and  Oppo RealMe 1 . When we review the Oppo F7, the performance offered by the chipset thoroughly impressed us. And we can expect a similar performance from the Nokia X5 too. Talking about the onboard storage, the base variant boasts a decent 32GB and the premium variant enjoys an ample 64GB.   In the photography department, the handset sports a dual camera setup at the back. Nokia had provided only a single camera on the Nokia 5.1 and Nokia 6.1 (Nokia 6 2018). But this time, the smartphone maker has tried to sprinkle a premium handset by providing dual camera on its budget handset. The setup embraces a primary camera of 13MP, f/2.0 supported by a 5MP secondary camera to inject the depth details in the portrait images. And for the selfies, Nokia has equipped an AI-powered 8MP camera on the front. The selfie shooter has the features like AI beauty, AI stickers, AI background blurring effect and dual-view shooting mode also known as ‘Bothie’. Bothie allows users to use the front camera and rear cameras at the same time. It basically embeds the subject information from both the cameras in a single photo. In addition, Nokia X5 will use this selfie shooter while unlocking the handset through the\xa0Face Unlock feature.   The Nokia X5 includes a 3060mAh battery and comes in three color variants: namely Blue, Black, and White. On the software side, the phone relishes the Stock or the unadulterated version of the Android Oreo. Google has also promised the  Android Pistachio (V9)  update to the handset and other regular software patches.  Nokia X5 (Nokia 5.1 Plus) Specifications    Dimensions – 149.51 x 71.98 x 8.0 mm; Weight: 160 grams  Display : 5.86-inch HD+ IPS LCD display, 84% screen-to-body ratio @19:9 aspect ratio  Chipset : MediaTek Helio P60  CPU:\xa0 Octa-core (4×2.0 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4×2.0 GHz Cortex-A53)  OS : Stock Android Oreo (v8.1); Upgradable to Android P (v9.0)  RAM : 3/4 GB  Storage : 32/64 GB; expandable up to 256 GB  Rear Camera : Dual: 13 MP, f/2.0 + 5 MP, phase detection autofocus, dual-LED dual-tone flash  Front Camera : 8 MP, f/2.2, AI-powered  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:\xa0 Dual Hybrid SIM with 4G  Battery : 3,060 mAh  Colors : Blue, Black, White   Nokia X5 Price and Availability  The smartphone entered the Chinese market with the price tag of CNY 999 ($149) for the 3/32GB and CNY 1,399 ($208) for the 4/64GB variant. The handset is available for pre-order in China on the Chinese online retailers like Suning, Jingdong, Tmall and also on the Nokia Mobile app store.

It was a mystery to all of us what the smartphone will be called exactly, what features will it behold and how will it perform. But now, we finally have information on all of that. Huawei has recently unveiled the much anticipated Huawei Nova 3 internationally. The smartphone was rumored to be launched around the mid of July but seems like Huawei could not resist showing off its new product.   Some of the specs had already been guessed, some may come as a surprise to us. Well, whatever be the case, the Nove 3 has come and seems to pack some top-notch features!        The first notable feature would be none other than the fact that it is powered by the  Kirin 970  chipset. If you think that sounds familiar, yes, its the same chipset that is used in Huawei’s latest flagship, the  Huawei P20 Pro !\xa0The chipset can be compared neck to neck with the powerful  Snapdragon 835  chipset. Supporting the performance is rumored to be 6GB of RAM.  Like the P20 Pro, this one does have 4 cameras but unlike the P20 Pro its got 2 cameras at the front and 2 at the back. Well, a total of four cameras indeed. It has become a trend for Huawei to include as many cameras as possible. But we are not complaining ;). About the camera pixels, at the back, it has a 16 MP f/1.8 RGB sensor coupled with a 24 MP Monochrome sensor featuring the same lens. On the selfie front, there is a primary 24 MP snapper with a 2 MP sensor for portraits.  Similarly, the Nova 3 comes with the recently introduced GPU Turbo technology. For those who are wondering what GPU Turbo technology is, it is a technology that optimizes GPU performance by bottlenecking between GPU’s hardware and software performance.  Following the flagship trend, it greets you with 3D Qmoji, a feature just like Apple’s Animoji, Samsung’s AR Emoji and Oppo’s Omoji. Likewise, the device is also said to have tons of AI features that are resulted from combined\xa0efforts of the UI and the chipset together.  Although the specs are revealed, the pricing of the device is yet to be revealed. Well, the launch date is set for the 18th of July, 2018, so we guess the wait will be over just then. The Huawei Nova 3 will be available in at least 4 colors, Nebula Purple (just like the P20 Pro), Aqua Blue, Black and Promise Gold.      right     back     left     front']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/huawei-Nova-3-1.jpg']

However, it seems like it hasn’t been able to keep up with the likes of Chinese brands. Can the recently launched  Samsung Galaxy J6  with the infinity display reclaim their position in the market? Let’s find out in our review.   Specifications of Samsung Galaxy J6   Dimensions:  149.3 x 70.2 x 8.2 mm  Weight:\xa0 154 gms  SIM:  Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by)  Display Type:  Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen  Display Size:  5.6 inches(~75.9% screen-to-body ratio)  Display Resolution:  720 x 1480 pixels, 18.5:9 ratio  OS:  Android 8.0 (Oreo)  Chipset:  Exynos 7870 Octa  CPU:  Octa-core 1.6 GHz Cortex A53  Process:  14nm architecture  Memory:  32/64 GB(expandable up to 256 GB slot)  RAM:  3/4 GB RAM  Primary Camera:  13 MP (f/1.9, 28mm), LED flash  Video:  1080p@30fps  Secondary Camera:  8 MP, f/1.9, LED flash  Connectivity:  Wi-Fi b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, FM Radio  Sensors:  Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity  Battery:  Non-removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery  Available Colors:  Black, Gold, Blue  Price in Nepal:  Rs. 24,790 (3GB/32GB); Rs. 29,090 (4GB/64GB)   Design and build  Starting from the design, I must say I love how it looks. The Galaxy J6 comes with a slender and smooth design which looks and feels great in hands. Attractive as it looks, its slim body makes it comfortable to hold and easy even for one-hand usage. The plastic back is neither matte nor glossy so there will be no annoying smudges and fingerprints on the back. However, it is quite smooth, so it frequently slipped from my hands.         On the left, there are volume buttons, a tray for sim 1 and a tray for sim 2 & micro SD card. The power button and the speaker is on the right. The speaker gives quite loud and crisp sound. I usually place my hand on the speaker while watching videos and wonder why the sound is so low even when it is in full volume. But after a week of usage, my hands naturally adjusted.   On the front, there’s an 8 MP camera with LED flash which is a plus in mid segment smartphone. A USB port along with the 3.5mm headphone jack is on the bottom while a 13 MP camera with LED flash is on the back.   Under the camera is a fingerprint sensor. Its quite accurate but it’s not the fastest out there. The face recognition works fairly in daylight, it takes some time before it unlocks the screen  Display  The Samsung J6 features a curved edge 2.5D glass for 5.6” Super AMOLED Infinity Display and the tall display with 18.5:9 screen to body ratio looks very attractive. Although the resolution is only HD, watching videos in the AMOLED panel is quite vivid and a treat to eyes.   The viewing angles are quite decent too. While watching videos I noticed that the colors are vivid and have precise contrast which you don’t usually get in a budget smartphone. The display is quite bright as well. It works fairly in sunlight even when it is in 75% brightness. However, one thing I wished this phone had was auto-brightness. Yes, we need to manually adjust the brightness.  Software  Moving on to the software department, the J6 runs on Android 8.0 Oreo. The UI looks quite similar to the S9 minus some features like Always on display. Since it also lacks Notification LED, I had to manually check for any notification which is bothersome at times. Come on Samsung, Notification LED is not a feature you should exclude in 2018.  I have always liked the Samsung UI as it is smooth and easy to use. Samsung has included some flagship features like S-health, Secure Folder and Samsung themes.\xa0Also, it has many advanced features as well like panic mode, dual messenger mode and so on. The dual messenger mode can be used for Facebook, Messenger, Viber and other few social media apps. And although like I mentioned before the phone is pretty sleek and comfortable to hold, there is an easy mode for better one hand use.                            However, I found apps like My Galaxy, Samsung Mall, Samsung Max and Samsung Pay mini to be useless and the fact you can’t uninstall them is annoying. Also, you can’t uninstall any of the pre-installed Microsoft apps.  Performance  The Samsung Galaxy J6 is powered by an Exynos 7870 which has been powering Samsung’s midrange phones since 2016.\xa0I am not saying it’s a bad chipset since it’s based on energy efficient 14nm process, however, Samsung could and should have opted for more powerful MediaTek Helio P60 or the Snapdragon 636 or their own Exynos 7885.  On to the real-life performance, the phone performed well during my usage.\xa0 I didn’t expect it to perform this well. It didn’t lag or heat up lag while using Facebook and Instagram. The good performance is partly due to the fact that it only has to power an HD display.  Now talking about multitasking, it takes a while when switching between apps but that’s only when there is a lot of apps running in the background. Animations and transitions on the Galaxy J6 have been cut down to a minimum.  Playing low-end games like Knife hit, Alto is decent and it doesn’t heat up even up to 50 minutes of continuous gameplay. If you don’t play graphics-intensive games, the phone offers more than enough horsepower to offer you satisfactory performance in everyday tasks. So, if you are a PubG fan, you may not want to play it on this one.  Camera  The single 13MP back camera captures above average daylight photos in auto mode, but in pro mode, you can tweak the settings to get better results. The sharpness and detail are good too. Color reproduction, however, is a hit or miss, which can easily be noticed on the Super AMOLED display. The dynamic range is also pretty average for the price. Low light images are not bad and I found the color reproduction on low light to be surprisingly better than the daylight images. Also, there is no portrait mode, so no fancy portrait photos.      Samsung Galaxy J6 Back Camera Samples   1  of 4                                                          The 8MP selfie camera on the front was quite impressive though. The selfies come out quite good even under low lighting. The pictures taken from the front camera are better than that from the rear camera.      Samsung Galaxy J6 Selfie Samples    1  of 2                                      Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Battery  The battery of J6 amazed me. The 3,000mAh battery easily lasts a whole day, including long calls on messenger to extensive gaming. The battery easily lasted about 6 hrs even while extensive usage. A drawback of the battery is the charging is very slow. It takes about 3 hrs to charge up to 100.   Conclusion  In a nutshell, the Samsung Galaxy J6 is a decent choice. It has got a good design, trendy 18:9 AMOLED display, surprisingly good performance, and excellent battery life. Also, Samsung has the brand appreciation and is probably the safest choice when it comes to aftersales and warranty here in Nepal. However, with the midrange smartphone market getting very competitive, you will easily get the  Xiaomi Redmi S2 \xa0or the  Huawei Y9  that offers more for the price.

As mentioned on the announcement, TSC will be levied to the Telecoms and ISPs from the Shrawan 1 of 2018 (July 17, 2018) or the from the first day of the new fiscal year.  Executives from the Telecoms and ISPs in agony say that it was announced in the budget without any prior notice or information. Even after the announcement, they even tried to woo the concerned authorities to take back the step. However, the ministry officials remain reluctant for any change in the decision. So the every attempted from the Telecom and ISPs’ officials turned futile. Now the users are on the verge of paying an extra high phone and internet bills in a regular fashion.        Worldlink’s say on internet price hike in Nepal  According to the current statistics from the Nepal Telecom Authority (NTA), the telephone and mobile phone users in Nepal are more than 38.5 million. Also, the broadband internet users have surged at an unprecedented rate and crossed over 14.35 million. And now, all these populations is going to get affected with this price hike.  How much will be the increment?  Here is the general insight of the price hike on the internet and mobile tariffs.

['Dell Vostro 5471 Review: Perfect Budget Business Laptop?'],"['Reviews', 'Dell', 'Vostro Series']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['July 16, 2018']",2018-07-16 16:36:54+00:00,"['Laptops are capable of a lot of things, but most will use it for basic tasks. Most of us will buy a laptop for gaming, or media consumption, but there are a lot of people who just want a laptop that works well, can do text editing, browse the web and take it where ever they go. Well, this one is mostly targeted at those people. The Dell Vostro 5471 is very portable, well-performing laptop with good thermals and a decent display. Continue reading to find out if this laptop is the perfect combination for you.   Specs of Dell Vostro 5471   Display : 14″ Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution IPS technology  Processor : Intel Core i7-8550U  Graphics Card : AMD Radeon 530  RAM : 8GB DDR4  HDD : 1TB  Weight : 1.6kgs  Battery : 65Whr (load 1h/idle 4h)  Price : Rs 1,00,000  ▶️Available at Big Byte, Putalisadak (9851183182)   Build and Design  The looks did succeed to impress me. The 14-inch laptop shows off rounded corners at the edges that don’t go out of notice. The notebook is slim and lightweight which has surely aided my activity of carrying it around every time. Well, I have never had to break a sweat trying to fit it in my bag!         Also, the slim design is something I was happy to show off. The only complaint I have with the design is that the edges are a bit too pointed and if not careful you can get scratches on your hands.  Display  The Dell Vostro 14 5471 features an IPS Full HD display that greets you with excellent viewing angles and a bright and vibrant display. Additionally, you also get an anti-glare feature that helps you prevent possible eye strain. Colours on this device seem bright and vibrant. I have loved watching videos and movies on this device.  Performance  The Dell Vostro 14 5471 is powered by  Intel’s 8 th  generation Core i7-8550U  CPU coupled with an independent  AMD Radeon 530  graphics card that handles the graphics of this device. Likewise, the 8 GB DDR4 RAM that comes with this device is ample for usage.  On day to day use, I have had no complaints with this device what so ever as this one provided me with speedy performance. Regular works including using Chrome, Microsoft office run like a breeze. I have also run Photoshop on this device and to my surprise, it ran quite smoothly. What was even more surprising is that Photoshop ran quite well with Illustrator running alongside it.  I am not trying to slam the performance of the GPU but even though this is an entry-level graphics processor, demanding applications like Photoshop and Illustrator ran quite well. Up until now, we have reviewed quite a few laptops and what’s common in them is that all of them were gaming laptops. But the Dell Vostro 14 5471 is a bit different because it caters to a different audience.  Gaming performance  All the impressive performance was until I started gaming on this device! The gaming performance of this device is, what I would like to say disastrous. First I played CS-G0, which ran at around 60 fps at medium settings at 1080p resolution. Now, this is not a very demanding game so I had more expectations for the laptop.  Then I tried playing PubG and even at low settings it was unplayable. Then I switched to very low settings and still, the game ran very poorly at around 30 fps. After some time I experienced serious frame drops and the game ran at 15 fps. So, the bottom line is, if there is something this laptop should not be used for, it’s gaming!  Since the Dell Vostro 5471 is not intended for gamers, I will not complain. I was just checking if this one would surprise me, but it didn’t.  Thermals  The laptop did heat up a little, although the surface temperatures never went above 50 degrees at any point, even under the most extreme loads. Under normal usages like Microsoft Word, Chrome and other stuff, the temperatures were totally usable. Neither did the laptop throttle up to a point where it was actually noticeable.  Read More:  MacBook Pro lineup refreshed for 2018  Storage & Connectivity  It has a 1TB hard drive, with an option to opt-in for an SSD. The hard disk did not feel slow at any point and app opening time was also fine. I would still put in an SSD for myself, but for the purpose, most will hardly care.  As a business user, you get ample ports for usage at your disposal. There are two UBS 3.0 ports, you get an SD card slot, HDMI port, DP/PD port, etc. So working on this laptop while connecting to other devices or network devices is not a problem. The fingerprint sensor that resides on the power button is just an icing on the cake.  The laptop also has a decent webcam for all the Skype calls and conferences, although selfies lovers will struggle. Similarly, the laptop had decent audio output with two speakers located at the bottom of two sides. With headphones connected, the Vostro 5471 has quality audio output.  Keyboard and Trackpad  Talking about physical usability, the keyboard is something that has impressed me thoroughly. The keys are placed at a good distance from each other making it less probable that you will press the wrong keys. Similarly, the keyboard has two levels of backlit adjustments that you can set in accordance to your preference. So, typing in dark conditions is not a problem with this one. The trackpad, on the other hand, is smooth and responsive.  Battery Life  Talking about battery life, the device gives you good backup for around 4 hours without plugging in the charger. Of course, battery drainage is relative to brightness settings and the type of work you do. So, on a medium level of brightness and regular works, it gave me 4 hours of battery. It’s impressive that the device takes less than an hour to get fully charged.  Conclusion   So if you ask me if business users should get this device, the answer is yes! In terms of looks and usability, the Dell Vostro 5471 delivers good performance. And since it can run Photoshop and Illustrator very well, it may be a good option for photographers who are looking for a portable yet good-looking laptop at a relatively lower price than high-end laptops. The drill here is, this is a good laptop, no doubts on that but I think it’s slightly overpriced. It would have been the best buy for a little bit lesser price tag. But on a serious note, for the gamers out there, this one is a big NO.

['Apple finally launches the MacBook Pro lineup we were waiting for'],"['Apple', 'MacBook']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['July 15, 2018']",2018-07-15 11:05:57+00:00,"['Apple last updated their  MacBooks in late 2016 , and it was a bit of a disappointment, to be honest. But for this year, it’s finally\xa0not the case, packed with the latest and greatest in the world of mobile computers, the new MacBooks are here to dazzle us. For instance, the maxed out MacBook Pro 2018 comes with a  Core i9 , 32GB RAM, 4TB SSD, 4K display,  Radeon Pro 560X , a great built quality as always and will set you back  $6,699 .  The above mention specs costs are mostly thanks to the $3200 4TB SSD, which is one of the most expensive components you can easily save money on. With that out of the way, you generally get two configurations, the 13-inch, and the 15-inch models. Although only the bigger one gets the dedicated graphics option.  The 13-inch is still available with 7th gen Intel processors, but the newer ones with 8th gen processors start at $1,799. For the price, you get the four core 8th gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, Iris Plus 655 graphics, a retina display with the usual touch bar. This configuration can go all the way up to\xa0$3,699, here you will get an i7, 16GB memory and 2TB of SSD.        Also Read:  MacBooks Price in Nepal  The 15-inch starts at $2,399 and comes with a six-core i7 processor, 16GB of 2400MHz memory, 256GB SSD and Radeon Pro 555x dedicated graphics. You can then upgrade it out to a Core i9, 32GB memory, 4TB SSD and the Radeon Pro 560X. The thermal performance will be a big question here but seeing how it’s an Apple product, everything should be fine.  The 32GB RAM option and i9 should keep people something to rejoice about, alongside the humongous\xa04TB of SSD storage. Thanks to which, Apple claims a 70% performance boost over the previous generation. Other than that, you also get the 3rd generation butterfly keyboard, which should be quieter and less prone to the bugs that we saw in the past. The addition of Apple’s T2 Chip is also a nice touch.  The displays on MacBook have always been some of the best ones out there, and this one is no less. The retina display is capable of P3 color gamut and has the same 500 nits of peak brightness. In addition to these features, Apple has come up with something called the True Tone which allows for a much natural viewing experience. Although content creators might want to stay away from this feature while working. Apple is also releasing new leather sleeves in Saddle Brown, Midnight Blue, and Black color options.  Finally, the eGPU, which isn’t a new feature but this time, it comes from Apple itself. This is for people who need the extra oomph\xa0in the graphics department. The enclosure\xa0comes with a Radeon Pro 580 graphics card, which isn’t upgradable. The enclosure is designed by Blackmagic and comes with four USB 3.0 connectors, HDMI 2.0 port and support of up to two 5k monitors through Thunderbolt 3. This enclosure\xa0is supported by both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro.  As always, the prices are pretty high, but justifiable for all the MacBook Pro enthusiasts out there. The GPU enclosure is also a really nice addition, which will encourage more user to opt for the MacBook instead of the iMac. More options or even a user replaceable graphics enclosure would have been better but it’s just how Apple does it. The $699 price tag for the eGPU also makes it sound a bit overpriced but you are getting a seamless easy way to boost graphics performance at least.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/macbook-pro-2018.jpg']

While some of the previous Microsoft releases have been specifically made for someone specific, say a student, this tablet has been designed for someone who is looking for a Windows experience at a cheap price tag.  The Microsoft Surface Go comes in two different variants. First, there is the base variant that has 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of eMMC internal memory and the Intel Pentium Gold processor. There is another variant that offers 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of SSD.

The Surface Go is just another example of this step from Microsoft. It has already showcased the detachable Keyboard, the wireless mouse, and the pen that is supported by the new device.  However, if you really want to use it as a computer, you will have to add in some cash. The keyboard costs $99 which makes the device’s price $499 and $649. So, basically, it is meant for someone who wants an affordable and portable Windows-running device.  The Microsoft Surface Go sells for $399 for the base variant and $549 for the higher end variant. Microsoft has already confirmed that it’s working on an LTE version of this device.

We are already delighted with its wide varieties of handsets released in 2018. Though the smartphone maker is not done yet. It recently launched the  Huawei Nova 3 . And alongside the handset, the Chinese electronics giant announced a smartwatch. Namely known as the Huawei TalkBand B5 Hybrid, this new smartwatch acts as a fitness-tracking device, which also as a Bluetooth headset.  In terms of display, the TalkBand B5 Hybrid comes with a 1.13-inch AMOLED display with 2.5D glass on the top of it. The display features the resolution of 300 x 160 pixels resulting in a pixel density of 301PPI, which is decent for any smartwatch. The device is said to be touch-sensitive so the users may not have any hard time accessing the features inside of this fitness tracker.         Design wise, the device looks like an ordinary smartwatch/fitness tracker. But what makes the TalkBand B5 Hybrid different is its unique design language, which lets the user pop-out the display. The popped out display then can be used as a Bluetooth earphone. The Bluetooth earphone offers a premium listening experience to the users, as it possesses trip-core audio chip for a high definition voice and two microphones for better noise reduction.   The device weighs 40 grams (excluding the strap) and dimension wise, it measures 58.2 x 23.3 x 12.9mm. Although in its small stature, the device contains a multitude of features. The device supports caller ID, call muting, and speed dial option for quickly calling a person in your contact. Apart from that, the device is IP67 certified making the smartwatch resistant to dust and water.  The TalkBand B5 comes with 512KB of RAM and 16MB of flash memory. This memory is mostly for storing the pre-installed apps since the sideloading of other apps is not possible in this device. Talking about the compatibility of the device with the smartphones, the smartwatch works fine with Android 4.4 and above. In the case of the Apple device, the device is said to work with the iOS version 9 (iOS 9) and above.  Furthermore, this fitness-tracking device is provided with TrueRelax Technology inside of it, which not only analyzes the heart rate variability but also evaluates the stress level. The device is also provided with the Huawei TruSeen 2.0 heart rate tech, which offers 24-hour heart rate monitoring for an accurate measurement of the palpitation of the heart. In addition, the device is also said to possess the sleep tracking technology known as the Huawei TruSleep 2.0. This feature uses cardiopulmonary-coupled dynamics spectrum (CPC) in order to monitor complete sleep structure including REM (deep sleep). With the complete and in-depth analysis of different stages of sleep, the device also presents recommendations to the users to improve their rest time.  The device boasts a 108mAh battery, which Huawei claims to provide 3.5 days of standby time and 6-hours of talk time. And talking about the strap on the device, there are three choices for the Silicone, Leather, and stainless steel all in 18mm size.   This time, Huawei just made the announcement claiming the existence of the device. And during the announcement session, Huawei did not disclose the pricing. However, the device is available for pre-order as of now until the July 19. And from July 20, the device will be available for the purchase.

The Chinese smartphone manufacturer announced this new invention a few months back. While now, we can already see Huawei smartphones receiving this feature through a software update. A feature that ramps up the GPU power of an existing device while minimizing power consumption.         The 60% performance and 30% less power consumption are some really high numbers from Huawei. Let alone the fact that these devices will be using the same hardware and will only rely on a simple OTA software update. Generational hardware upgrades don’t boast these types of figures, to begin with.  Huawei Mediapad 5 is the newest device in the long line of tablets and smartphone that will receive the GPU Turbo update. Users of some Honor,  Mate , and the  P20 series  have already been enjoying these performance boosts for a while now. The update, as expected has been said to boost up the performance of the devices and drastically improve their gaming experience.  The fight between the right amount of performance and battery consumption has been going on for a while now. But Huawei claims that they have figured this out thanks to the GPU Turbo. Thanks to their in-house\xa0Kirin chipset, in-house\xa0software and a lot of R&D was this made achievable. So, this comes as no surprise that only the Huawei devices will enjoy these benefits.

Although late to the game, laptop manufacturers have started to launch their gaming laptops with full-fledged 6 core 8th gen Intel processors. More specifically, the Intel Core i7-8750H that replaces the 7700HQ from the last generation, boasting around 20-30% of performance improvement.  The Core i7-8750H is blessed with 6 cores, 12 threads, yet has the same 45W TDP. It’s built on the 14nm coffee lake architecture from Intel, with 2.2 GHz base and 4.1 GHz boost clock speeds. Finally, not that it matters much in this context, but they do come with Intel UHD 630 integrated graphics solution.  MSI GT75 Titan 8RG  The MSI GT75 Titan 8RG is the most expensive of the bunch, priced at Rs 436,500, it’s clearly one of the best laptops for gaming you can buy in Nepal right now. It comes with the i7-8750H processor, paired with just 16GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 2400MHz. It is upgradable up to a maximum of 64GB, but for the price, I was really hoping for more.        Putting that aside, this laptop features a 17.3″ UHD 4K display capable of 100% AdobeRGB color coverage. Now that is pretty impressive, but whats more impressive is the GTX 1080 GPU, that goes hand in hand with the 4K display. The 512GB NVME SSD along with a 1TB hard disk is no surprise.

It also has a low 3ms response time, with a 100% RGB color coverage. It also features the i7-8750H, with 16GB of RAM, 256GB NVME SSD, and a 1TB mechanical hard disk.  To go along with the 120Hz refresh rate, MSI has fitted a GTX 1070 inside with 8GB of GDDR5 VRAM. The laptop is priced at Rs 242,500, which is probably worth the specs but get this, it also has individually lit RGB keyboard, which looks pretty DOPE.

It has features very similar to the Raider, except for the GTX 1060 instead of 1070. So, for around 40k less, you still get the 120Hz 3ms display, the same amount of RAM and storage.

Not that it would matter much, thanks to the underpowered GTX 1050, which rarely pushes out more than 60fps in most games.\xa0  This laptop sadly only has a single colour backlit (RED) Full sized steel series keyboard. It also doesn’t come with an SSD, just 8GB of RAM and a 1TB HDD. On the positive side, the GTX 1050 is, in fact, the 4GB variant.

Starting at a base price of Rs 150,100, you get an 8th gen hexacore i7-8750H processor with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of moving hard disk. But the star of the show remains the GTX 1060, as a 4GB variant is still pretty capable, to say the least.  The other option you get is the Rs 180,405 variant, which for Rs 30k more, you get 16GB RAM up from just 8GB, the same i7 processor, and an extra 256GB SSD storage. The only other major change here is the GTX 1060, which has 6GB of VRAM, so you can expect a slightly better performance.  The Dell G3 is, however, not that appealing for the price. It’s priced similar to the base version of G7, although only features the GTX1050Ti. So, if you have a budget of around 150k, you should definitely go for the G7. Of course, you are free to do whatever you want, but we recommend the G7 over the G3, at least in Nepal (or in SastoDeal, again, we do not recommend grey market).']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dell-g-series.jpg']
['Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Review: The Perfect Midrange Phone'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Xiaomi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['July 3, 2018']",2018-07-03 13:37:36+00:00,"['Mid-range smartphones  seem to be on the rise these days. Offering a better price to performance ratio, the mid-range smartphones are providing premium features at a budget-friendly price. The  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI  is one of such devices which seems capable of superseding all the mid-range handsets at its price segment when looked into the specs. But is the smartphone that good? Let’s find in this review.   Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Specs   Display:\xa0 5.99-inch IPS FHD+ display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Protection  CPU:\xa0 1.8 GHz Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 636  GPU:\xa0 Adreno 509 GPU  OS: \xa0Android Oreo 8.0 with MIUI 9.0 on the top  RAM:\xa0 3/4GB  Storage: \xa032/64GB,\xa0up to 128GB expandable storage (uses SIM 2)  Rear Camera: \xa0 5MP + 12MP, LED flash  Front Camera: \xa013MP with f/2.0 with LED flash  Sensors : Accelerometer, proximity, gyro, IR blaster, Fingerprint  SIM: \xa0Dual hybrid SIM with 4G VOLTE  Battery:\xa0 4,000mAh  Price: \xa0Rs. 29,999 (4GB/64GB)  Price: \xa0Rs. 25,999 (3GB/32GB)   Also Read:  Xiaomi Mobiles Price in Nepal        Design and Build  In terms of design, I did not find any wow factors in the Redmi Note 5 AI. Just look at it, it comes with the typical Xiaomi Redmi design language; the metallic back with plastics on top and bottom. I only wished the design was similar to last year’s  Mi A1 . The metallic back, however, feels sturdy and durable. For the better grip of the phone, Xiaomi has also provided tapered edges. Nonetheless, during the time of my use, the device slipped frequently through my hands. I also found it to be heavy mainly because of its big battery.   Talking about the buttons, the phone has aligned all the tactile buttons on the right with the power button positioned right beneath the volume rockers. And as always, Xiaomi has placed the IR blaster on the top, speaker grill, charging port and port for the 3.5mm headphone jack at the bottom.   I had highly admired the inclusion of USB Type C port on the MI A1 and was hoping Xiaomi would do the same in all of its mid-range handsets since then. But that hope escalated quickly when I saw the Micro USB port on the device. It is 2018 Xiaomi, aren’t you being too traditional?  Display  Up front, Xiaomi has followed the trend of tall 18:9 aspect ratio display.\xa0 The 5.99-inch Full HD+ display has an appreciable color reproduction and contrast ratio. However, I did notice blue tint on the display with cold color tone. You can adjust the color tone of the display to Warm, Cool or Standard as per your liking.   The IPS panel, on the other hand, has good viewing angles and is fairly bright to be used on a sunny day.   Camera  On the camera front, the Redmi Note AI comes with a  dual camera setup  at the back. The 12MP and 5MP camera pair on the device capture great pictures. I was thoroughly impressed by the amount of details. But some images seem to lack punchy colors, which was quite displeasing for my taste.  Talking about the portrait mode on the handset, the Note 5 AI did a fine job most of the time. But the edge detection is not quite perfect. Sometimes, the captured images had some jittery edge detection. And since the smartphone does not have a Live Focus mode like in the Samsung phones, readjusting the focus and blur intensity was not possible. So some of the portrait images I took from the device straightly find the way to the trash.      Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Back Camera Samples   1  of 8                                                                                                  Moving on to the selfie shooter, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI has got a 13MP snapper up front. As the name suggests, the selfie shooter is enriched with the Artificial Intelligence and that is what differs it from the Redmi Note 5 Pro.      Normal Mode Vs Beauty Mode   1  of 2               Normal Mode         Beauty Mode                  Well, after the 20MP sensor on the Pro. With the wide aperture and larger pixel size, the details of the subject look sharp and clear. The device also takes some appealing selfies with natural like beautification because of the AI. Furthermore, despite the presence of a single camera, there is a portrait selfie mode. Since the portrait selfie from the device is entirely through the software tweaks, the smartphone fails to distinguish the foreground and background details quite accurately. Nonetheless, the portrait selfies are duly remarkable considering the price.      Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Selfie Samples   1  of 4               Low Light Shot         Group Selfie         Portrait Selfie         Normal Selfie                        Talking about the video, the smartphone is only capable of recording Full HD videos at max. The Snapdragon 636 chipset is capable of recording video at maximum 4K resolution. So I could not understand why Xiaomi had to limit its potential. Nonetheless, Xiaomi has promised to introduce the 4k recording feature in the next update. So I was not disappointed with that absence for so long.  Talking about the video quality, I have no complaints whatsoever. The video packs in abundant details and the color reproduction look fine. But despite the presence of the  Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) , I found the videos quite shaky to my likings. Since the Redmi Note 5 AI is a mid-range handset, that was understandable. But you can always use a tripod if you are seriously into shooting the videos with the handset.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here  Performance  The feature focus of the phone is the powerful Snapdragon 636 chipset. It comes in two memory configurations. The unit I reviewed has 4GB RAM and 64GB of onboard storage, which is ample for my usage. So, no disappointment there.  And talking about the performance, I had lots of expectations with the Snapdragon 636 chipset. And I am fairly pleased with the way it performed. Multitasking and switching between the apps is fluid. Even while playing the high-end graphics enriched games, I found no issues at all: no annoying lags and no filthy stutters.  I was not expecting any heating issues on the handset, but the device heated up offering me an ugly surprise. And playing the games on a heated phone was no fun at all. Come on Xiaomi, do something on this heating issue. The weather is already hot as hell.  Software  In terms of software, the handset comes with the Android Oreo out of the box. The device had MIUI 9.0 on the top at the beginning. After a couple of days of my usage, I received the MIUI 9.5 stable version. Since Xiaomi has already rolled out the MIUI 10, the users can install the MIUI 10 beta version and taste the interesting features in it. But if you are not planning to upgrade the UI until the stable version like me, you should probably have to wait till September.      Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Software UI   1  of 6                                                                              Nonetheless, despite the remarks of being heavy and highly customized, the MIUI 9.5 did not bug me on my use. But it did not please me either. The handset comes with a numerous bloatware. Yeah, the presence of numerous bloatware is hit or miss. And in my case, it was mostly miss. Nonetheless, I find the features like Dual space, App Clone, and Read Mode handy for my daily use.  Security  Like always, Xiaomi has provided the fingerprint sensor at the back. The sensor is really fast and accurate and I did not have any hard time unlocking the device.   The phone also has a Face Unlock feature but activating the feature was kind of tricky. The feature was accessible only when the region was set to India. It is weird, right? I still cannot understand why Xiaomi is providing features like that just in the specific locations. Nonetheless, the Face Unlock on the device is fast, which is really appreciable.  Battery  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI comes with a whopping 4000mAh battery, which provides around 9 hours of screen on time. This humongous battery delivers enough horsepower for two days on the normal usage. However, the charging process is quite bothering. The smartphone takes around 2 and half hours to get refilled from 0 to 100% and that too with the stock charger. But since the device supports Quick Charge 3.0, the users can buy a decent QC 3.0 charger to avoid plugging the handset to the charger for a longer period of time.  Conclusion  To sum it up, the Redmi Note 5 AI is without a doubt the best smartphone at its price point. It has got the big display in the trendy aspect ratio, a capable processor, massive battery, and decent sets of cameras. Yes, it has a heating issue which Xiaomi should fix it in its next update, I also expected better portraits and the audio quality is just average. However, these are minor issues which you can live without.\xa0 So, if you want the best overall package at a midrange price, this is the choice.

Before that, mobile phone companies advertised a lot about the dual cameras their phones housed. Since Huawei launched its flagship, lots of experts implied on the time of quad cameras being not so far away. And their assumption is turning out to be correct. A new smartphone is soon to be launched in the mobile phone industry. What’s new about it? Well, it houses 9 cameras on its back.  That’s true. Light, the company that displayed the L16, a multi-aperture computational camera, at  CES 2018 , is coming with this smartphone that has various cameras with various sensors and various apertures. The L16 had 16 different cameras at work. Yes, 16! Although the design of this device was quite different than what we usually see on cameras, this unique step from Light was surely commendable. The L16 camera is capable of capturing images with 52-megapixel resolution.         With nine cameras at the helm, the new smartphone from Light will be embedded with a lot of features the L16’s cameras house. It will do well under low-light conditions and the depth effects will surely be top-notch.  The Huawei P20 Pro introduced 5x optical zoom in the mobile phone industry. This feature was well received by all reviewers and experts. Huawei achieved this with the three cameras on the back. Now imagine the zoom feature of the Light smartphone that will come with 9 lenses.  Light recently showcased the prototypes of its smartphone to the Washington Post, and those devices had 5 to 9 cameras on the back. And if Light gets it right, the smartphone will be capable of shooting pictures of 64-megapixel.  However, it’s the pricing that will be interesting to see. The Light L16 comes with a price of $1,950 and with all the camera capabilities it has, I expect this device to come with a hefty price tag. This smartphone from Light will be available by the end of this year, and it will be powered by Android.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/light-smartphone-launching-soon.jpg']

Yes, we are talking about the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, which will officially\xa0launch on August 9. But thanks to Eldar Murtazin, a well-known leaker of smartphone specs in the business, we know a lot more about the Note 9.   Now the person who did share this information spent some time with the pre-production unit of the Note 9 which looked a lot similar to the Note 8, with the only difference coming from the back. It comes with the regular dual camera setup, but this time with the fingerprint below these cameras, like on the S9. The materials used remains the same, however.        The battery capacity has also gone up to a respectable\xa04000mAh, power users ought to rejoice. The phone’s weight has also gone up for the same reasons. The battery will now last around one to two days of normal usage with video playbacks reaching 23 to 25 hours under maximum brightness conditions.  The 8th generation on the Note series will come with Qualcomm chipset for the US and South Korea whereas the rest of the world gets the Exynos treatment. It will most probably be the Snapdragon 845, however, the leakster\xa0did point out at a possible upgraded chipset. The claim was backed up by the fact that the smartphone felt considerably fast and snappier than before.  The phablet will likely start with 6GB of RAM and at least\xa0128GB of storage. The configurations will go up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage with a possible 512GB variant as well. That’s a lot of storage options, and same goes for the colour options as well. The five colours are Blue, Brown, Black, Yellow, Lavender and Gray.  The camera department might also see some improvements. The newer ISOCELL technology alongside an improved image stability hardware is also possible. The S Pen is also said to obtain new features like Bluetooth support and an option to remotely unlock the device. There will also be a set of new work modes that will likely attract the business users.  As always the newer flagship comes with an even better display, this time in the form of better sunlight\xa0visibility which also means more brightness. There might also be a newer updated Always on Display feature which might or might not make it to the Note 9. If it doesn’t, it will make it’s way to the S10.  Sources claim that Note 8 has stopped shipping to their retail partners. If you want one now, you will have to try the ones they have in stock. These rumors hint towards the fact that the Note 9 will be very similar to the Note 8. This is however just another way of ensuring all the attention goes to the Note 9.  So, what do you think about the Galaxy Note 9? Do these rumors hint at a better and more compelling smartphone compared to the Note 8? Do let us know if you will be buying the Note 9 in the comment section below. As always these are just rumored so do take all these information with a heavy pinch of salt.

Talking about the picture quality, this Samsung 4K TV displays sharp and vivid pictures, which are injected with accurate colors quite brilliantly.\xa0 Alongside the vibrant display, the screen is fairly bright. So the users should not have to worry about shutting down the drapes and turning off the lights to view the content in the screen. Furthermore, the TV is HDR+ enabled, the screen is capable of reproducing colors with so much of accuracy that the details on the darkest shadows and whitest clouds can be recollected more than what is seen on the normal or conventional display.

It now comes with many improvements in battery, performance, software, but is priced slightly higher. So the question arises is it worth the price and does it provide value for money? Let’s find out now.   Specification of Nokia 6.1   Dimensions:  148.8 x 75.8 x 8.2 mm  Display:  IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen  Size:  5.5 inches, ~73.2% screen-to-body ratio  Resolution:  1080 x 1920 pixels, 16:9 ratio  OS:  Android 8.1 (Oreo)  Chipset:  Qualcomm SDM630 Snapdragon 630  CPU:  Octa-core 2.2 GHz Cortex-A53  RAM:  3/4 GB RAM  Internal:  32/64 GB, expandable upto 256GB  SIM:  Hybrid Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by)  CAMERA:  Primary 16 MP (f/2.0, 27mm, 1.0µm), phase detection autofocus, Zeiss optics,  Secondary:  8 MP (f/2.0, 1.12µm)  Video:  2160p@30fps, 1080p@30fps  Connectivity:  Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, hotspot,Bluetooth 5.0, A2DP, LE, FM radio  Sensors:  Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  Battery:\xa0 Non-removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery   Design and Build  Let’s start with the design and the build. Nokia phones are always built like a tank and this one is no exception. The unibody metal with flat diamond-cut sides rounded corners not only feels solid in hand but has survived drops many times. I won’t be doing any sort of drop test but believe me, it feels like a rugged phone without looking ugly.         On the front, there is an 8MP camera and a Nokia logo at the top right and a thick black bezel on the bottom. The headphone jack is placed on the top and the power button and volume button are on the right. And what I noticed right away was that the buttons are not very tactile.   There is a 16MP camera on the back with LED flash and fingerprint sensor. The sensor is built too low and almost all the time I place my finger on the flash. And not to forget, the fingerprint sensor isn’t among the fastest one around.   A SIM tray is on the left, while the speaker next to the USB type C is placed on the button. The audio quality while streaming videos or playing high-quality games is impressive, though it doesn’t come with a stereo speaker. The\xa0Single speaker with smart amplification works really well.  The phone has a smooth back and it slips from my hand once in a while. Also, the 6.1 is not very ideal for one-hand usage- especially if you have small hands. Nevertheless, the phone is still very attractive and has a premium look than most of the budget smartphones.  Display  Up front, you get a 5.5-inch Full HD display in 16:9 aspect ratio which makes the phone seem oddly stubby and outdated. But the quality of the panel doesn’t look that bad once the display is on. The IPS LCD is sharp with high contrast, but the color is not very accurate.   Talking about brightness, it’s one of the brightest display I have seen and it works great in the sunlight.\xa0Though it does seem too bright when you are indoors for that, there is adaptive brightness. The adaptive brightness can also be scheduled to activate automatically and you can also adjust the intensity as per your necessity.  Performance and Software  Now, moving on to the performance, Nokia 6.1 has Snapdragon 630 processor which is a quite an improvement from its 2017 version. With a pure version of Android, the performance is smooth. Nokia 6.1 houses a 3 GB RAM and 32 GB internal storage which provides a smooth performance and enough storage to run games. There is also a 4GB/64GB version available  It takes about 40-45 mins to slightly heat up with normal usage which includes Facebook, Instagram and light games like Jump Stack. However, I can’t say the same while playing high-end games. The phone does heat up after 30 mins of using apps and games like Snapchat and PUBG. I had to tone down the graphics while playing PUBG for better performance.  The phone runs on Android 8.1 (Oreo) and being a part of\xa0Google’s Android One program is also among the device’s highlights as this device will get regular software updates. It also means the device will have no bloatware or unnecessary animations affecting the performance.      Nokia 7 Plus UI    1  of 4                                                          Camera  Moving on to the camera, it features a 16 MP single rear camera. As it doesn’t have a dual camera there won’t be any fancy portrait mode. The normal photos are quite colorful and crisp in proper lighting. I wouldn’t say it has great detailing or very sharp in normal mode. But the HDR mode gives a quite good sharpness and detail. Also, it seems to oversaturate the sky and scenery making it look a little unnatural.                      There is a very noticeable shutter lag and takes a while to take a picture which turns out blurry if not kept steady. Now, the pictures were taken at night and poor lighting condition are very disappointing. It doesn’t have good detailing and it struggles to present much more than noise.  Selfies taken from the 8MP front camera is decent and has an ok detailing in daylight. However, the beauty mode isn’t very satisfying. It comes out very soft and unfocused at times.      Nokia 6.1 Selfie Samples    1  of 2                                      Surprisingly, there is 4k video recording, time-lapse, and slow motion. Nokia 6.1 also has digital stabilization and audio recording which is not available in most budget smartphones.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples  here  Battery  The Nokia 6.1 houses a Non-removable Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery and supports Type-C. The battery really amazed me. The phone offers a great battery life and lasts more than a day. It also supports fast charging and takes only 1hr 30 mins to get a full charge.  Also Read: \xa0 Nokia Phones Price In Nepal  Conclusion  So for the price, the Nokia 6.1 is quite competitive among the midrange segment. The all-metal phone has an attractive design with solid quality, it’s running on stock android which promises timely software updates, the chipset is capable, and battery life is great with fast charging support.   However, it’s not a perfect device: it lacks dual cameras with no portrait mode and the lowlight images are poor. The 32GB storage might not be enough for some and you have to cash in extra for the 64GB version. Also, it lacks the tall display with 18:9 aspect ratio. But despite all that, I still think Nokia 6.1 is a great choice alongside the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI.  And this was our Nokia 6.1 full review.

And it looks like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is becoming a reality this August because Samsung has set out invitations for an event on 9th August for a new Galaxy device. Now, the company has not confirmed the name of the newbie but there is a very high probability that it is going to be a new addition in Samsung’s Note lineup.  Now, its a rumor game but there are a few updates on the possible specs of the Note 9. So, what do we know so far is that the design is most probably going to be the same. The performance segment is going to be taken care of by the Snapdragon 845 in the US and China and Exynos 9810 chipset in the rest of the world.\xa0  Similarly, rumors have it that the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is said to come bearing 6 GB of RAM and a total of 512 GB of internal storage. But this is just a rumor so we can be sure that it will come in 64/128/256 GB of storage but anything more than that can be held true only after the official announcement. Also, talks about in-display fingerprint sensor may be a little premature.        What about the S-pen?  There are again a lot of rumors surrounding the S-pen but none have been confirmed. Some sources reveal that there is an S-Pen button which suggests an expanded stylus functionality. Well, if the updated S-Pen rumor is true, it’s certainly going to catch attention and Samsung fans because we haven’t seen many upgrades in the S-Pen lately.  Nothing has been truly confirmed by Samsung itself, so we can only make guesses. However, if the talks surrounding a similar design language\xa0is true, it’s going to boring. Likewise, Samsung the fingerprint sensor placement has always been criticized and if there is no change in it too, it’s going to be boring. Considering that the Exynos 9810 may be used yet again, there is a serious need for something new in the Note series this time. Well, I am keeping my fingers crossed.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Samsung-S9-launch-date.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy J2 2018 Review: Mediocre Performer'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['June 28, 2018']",2018-06-28 04:29:53+00:00,"['In a competitive low-budget segment where Chinese brands have started to leave a mark, Samsung has launched the 2018 edition of  Galaxy J2 , a smartphone with some interesting specs in a not so expensive price tag. So let’s find out if the Galaxy J2 stand tall against the competition.  Latest Price: Rs. 14,290 [Last updated on: December 6, 2018]         Build and Design  The Galaxy J2 is a well-built device which is sturdy to a certain extent. It feels really good in the hand, a feature none of its competitors can really brag about. It does have a removable back, where you can find the removable battery as well as 2 SIMs & a memory card slot.  The back is plastic, but there were virtually\xa0zero creeks and squeaks. The front features a 16:9 display and the traditional Samsung home button which does not double as a fingerprint. Apart from that, it’s the usual volume keys at the left and power button at the right.   Display  This device is compact, and the 5-inch display is pretty good. It is a lower resolution panel (qHD, 540X960p), but the AMOLED nature means colors\xa0pop and brightness isn’t a problem.   The one issue I came up with was YouTube videos cap out at just 480p, which is watchable, but we really missed the crispiness.  Performance  The Snapdragon 425 here is a solid choice that can handle basic tasks running social media apps with a couple of lags here and there. Mid to low-end games were playable, with clash royal, tank stars running without any frame drops. However, default apps like phone, message, and settings take a second to load up.  Software  The J2 2018 currently runs on a relatively old version of Android (7.1.1 Nougat), with Samsung Experience Version 8.5 on top. The Android security patch level is on March 1, 2018, which is nice. But expecting future updates are a bit of a stretch here.      software version     about phone     app drawer     settings     drop down menu     home     camera app   The UI is pretty minimal with very less bloatware. It has improved a lot over time and I feel Samsung is going towards the right direction, at least in the software department.  Camera  The J2 has an 8MP sensor at the back, and it’s barely usable. The camera produced dull pictures and it lacked saturation and colors. It also suffers in low light conditions\xa0and overall, the sharpness and details were average. The front camera also follows the same story. Samsung has included an LED flash here, but I don’t think it is of much help since the camera itself is subpar.      J2 2018 rear camera sample     J2 2018 rear camera sample     J2 2018 rear camera sample     J2 2018 front camera sample     J2 2018 front camera sample   Battery  The 2600mAh battery delivers adequate usage of around 3-4 hours of on screen time, which translates to a full day of usage with 4G enabled all the time. The charging time is around 2 hours, and we can’t really expect more in this price range.      random day 1     random day 2   Conclusion  The Galaxy J2 is a good phone, and we couldn’t agree more. It has a good build quality, AMOLED display, satisfactory performance and good battery life. I don’t know why Samsung thought it was a good idea to compromise on the display resolution and camera performance.   For those same reasons, it’s hard to recommend the J2 2018 as you can get better hardware at the same price. You can also add a bit more money and get something like the Huawei Y7 or even the Xperia XA which are on another level compared to the Samsung Galaxy J2 2018. With that out of the way, if you are a true Samsung fan, then maybe try it out yourself once.

UMIDIGI S2 Lite Specifications:  A miniature variant of the flagship device, the S2, the S2 Lite is by no means a compromise. It has excellent specifications on paper, but all will come down to its pricing.         The UMIDIGI S2 Lite comes in a unibody metal design that cloaks a display with minimalistic bezels. Looks wise, the S2 lite reflects its sibling, the S2 Pro as the former has the same design aspect in an almost similar form factor.  The S2 Lite sports a tall 5.99-inch Sharp TDDI display that comes in a HD+ resolution. At a time when most smartphone companies are opting for a full HD display on their smartphones, this choice UMIDIGI has made is quite strange, provided that its another smartphone, the C Note, also features a 1080p panel.  In terms of the internals, the UMIDIGI S2 Lite is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6750 with 1.5 GHz of clock speed alongside 4 GB of RAM and Mali-T860 MP2 GPU. It runs on the older Android v7.0 Nougat but provides a near stock experience, and the device comes with 64 GB of internal memory.

Sensors wise, there are all the necessary ones embedded on the device as it has Gravity Sensor, Ambient Light Sensor, Proximity Sensor, E-compass, and Gyroscope.   The battery on the S2 Lite is certainly the USP of the device as it features a huge 5,100 mAh battery. This battery coupled with an HD+ screen will certainly provide users with an exceptional battery life.  UMIDIGI Price in Nepal  We are yet to know the final pricing of the UMIDIGI S2 Lite in Nepal.

['Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro launched: A budget smartphone with notched display & dual camera'],['Xiaomi'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 26, 2018']",2018-06-25 19:18:44+00:00,"['The Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi has been aggressively launching the smartphones these days. The smartphone maker announced the smartphones like  Redmi 6, 6A ,  Redmi Y2 ,  Redmi S2 ,  Xiaomi MI 8, MI 8 SE  and many others in a quick succession. And Xiaomi is not yet satisfied with the number of choices it already laid upon the users. Recently, it launched yet another smartphone in the budget-friendly category alongside the  MI Pad 4 . Namely known as the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, this affordable handset comes with the notch on the display and a set of two cameras at the back.  Also Read:  Xiaomi Mobiles price in Nepal  The Redmi 6 Pro comes with a typical Xiaomi design, the metal clad body enclosed with the plastic caps on the top and on the bottom. Despite the lack of any wow factor in terms of the design, the handset gives a premium vibe with a cut out on the display. Started by the  Essential PH-1 phone  and made popular by the  iPhone X , this design language on the display is on the trend these days. We have seen numerous applications of the notched display in the mid-range handsets. But on the budget smartphones, it had been quite rare. This handset could easily fall on the choice of the enthusiasts, who seek for an affordable smartphone with a notched display.         Talking about the design, the 6 Pro enjoys a tall 5.84-inch display, which comes in the 19:9 aspect ratio. This appealing (ugly for some people) notch display features a Full HD+ resolution. With the Full HD+ display, the content on the screen can be expected to look all lively and vivid.  In terms of camera, the Redmi 6 Pro is enriched with the dual camera at the back. When looked at the rear camera of the phone, the combination of hardware used closely resembles  Xiaomi’s own Redmi S2 . So we can expect that the vertically aligned 12MP +5MP cameras on the Redmi 6 Pro could throw an identical performance like the Redmi S2.  Up front, there is 5MP selfie shooter on the handset. Despite being low in terms of  megapixel count , the front camera is HDR enabled and AI-powered. Additionally, the front camera also finds its scope on unlocking the handset by sensing the face of the user.   Moving on to the chipset and processor, it is boring to see the Snapdragon 625 chipset again. Lately, Xiaomi has brought quite a handful of handsets with the SD 625 chipset in the similar price point. And seeing it again did not seem exciting. Nonetheless, the SD 625 is a capable chipset and can perform remarkably well at this price point. In terms of the memory, the smartphone comes in three memory configurations: 3GB/32GB, 4/32GB, and 4/64GB.  Talking about the sensors, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro has got all the basic sensors including the fingerprint sensor at the back. And hidden beneath the metallic back, there is a 4000mAh battery to fuel the processes inside the phone.  As for the price, the base variant is priced at CNY 999 ($153) whereas the other two variants, 4/32GB, and 4/64GB variants carry the price tags of CNY 1,199 ($185) and CNY 1,299 ($200), respectively.

With smartphones and laptops getting popular day by day, the assumption that tablets would shine over the years have gone downhill. Despite that, some companies are still cashing in on tablets, and this time, that company is Xiaomi as it has launched the Mi Pad 4 in China.  Read More:   Xiaomi Mobiles Price in Nepal  The Xiaomi Mi Pad 4 comes with an 8-inch display that has a 16:10 aspect ratio and a WUXGA resolution which translates to 1900 x 1200 pixels. The device is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset which is certainly a good choice for the price tag it holds. For multitasking purpose, it has 3 and 4 GB RAM variants that couple with 32 GB and 64 GB of memory respectively. For battery purpose, the device houses a 6,000 mAh brick on the inside. What’s good here is the size of this device as it is just 7.9 mm thin.         The Xiaomi Mi Pad 4, in the optics front, is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera that has an f/2.0 aperture and can take up to 1080p videos. Strangely enough, this device has a 5-megapixel selfie shooter that supports Xiaomi’s “AI Face Unlock”. In terms of the software, the device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo with MIUI 9.0 on top.  Connectivity wise, the Xiaomi Mi Pad 4 comes with all connectivity options as it supports Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac. It also has Bluetooth 5.0 which is certainly a welcome addition. There is also a variant that supports LTE.  The Xiaomi Mi Pad 4 is currently available for pre-order in China, with the device becoming available starting June 29. The base-line model of the device with 3 GB RAM and 32 GB memory costs CNY1,099 which roughly translates to $170 whereas the 4/64 GB version without and with LTE supports will cost CNY1,399 (approx. $215) and CNY1,499 (approx. $229).

['HP Omen 15T laptop Review: Good Deal Below 100K'],"['Dell', 'HP', 'Omen Series', 'Reviews']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['June 23, 2018']",2018-06-23 09:29:22+00:00,"['The HP Omen 15T can be an overkill for most people. But for us, it was pure joy, with all the linings and all the reds in all the right places, we think this laptop looks pretty “dope”. It also gets a nice spec sheet and an acceptable price tag. The build quality is also not that bad and you probably won’t regret buying it.  Also Read:  Budget Gaming Laptops in Nepal Under 1 Lakh  HP Omen 15T\xa0Specs   Display : 15.6″ Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution IPS technology  Processor : Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8GHz (Turbo up to 3.8GHz)  Graphics Card : NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 with 2GB GDDR5  RAM : 8GB DDR4 2400MHz  HDD : 1TB  Weight : 2.2kgs  Battery : 64Whr (load 1.5h/idle 5h)  Price : Rs 1,00,000          Build and Design  I must say the laptop looks pretty good, but what’s even more impressive is it’s build quality. Initially looking at the laptop, it does feel a bit flimsy and\xa0not very durable. The top is made up of more than one layer of plastic, all for aesthetical purposes of course, but it’s not really so bad\xa0once you start using it.  This is one of the most typical gaming laptops out there. With a huge multiplication sign on the top and on the bottom of the keyboard, you know what you’re getting into. It also goes all in with the red sprinkled all over the laptop. The top and bottom are plastic, but the palm rest including the keyboard area is all metal.  Display  Opening the lid, you are greeted by a 15.6-inch 1920×1080 IPS panel. It’s not really a bad panel but anything other than gaming and you will find yourself on the frustrating side of life. It just doesn’t produce a lot of colors, or what most people call accurate color reproduction. Technically, the display is capable of producing about 65% of sRGB and 49% of AdobeRGB color spectrum with brightness hovering at around 213nits.  If that makes no sense to you, then let me explain. It’s a bad display, with average color reproduction. But most people won’t mind it and it’s still a really usable and sharp display. The display is also capped at 60Hz, but there are 1080p@144Hz and 4k@60Hz versions available as well. Those also provide better color accuracy and are much much brighter.  Performance  The laptop performs pretty decently, with an Intel Core i7 7700HQ processor paired with 8GB of RAM and 1TB mechanical hard drive. Now, I felt the laptop performed very well, as so it should. It has one of the best processors of last year. The CPU also goes very well with the GPU in hand, with a bit of bottleneck. It’s fine, as the GPU bottlenecks the CPU and not the other way around as far as gaming is concerned, isn’t it?\xa0  Gaming Performance  It features a GTX 1050 with 2GB of GDDR5 VRAM. Some might call it entry-level for gaming, but for those average users, it is going to be more than enough. It’s definitely better than last year’s 950M or even the 960M. We like to think it goes toe to toe with the 965M.  You can play most games at medium to low settings without compromising on the resolution. If you lock the fps at 30, you can even get away with high configurations. I suggest you choose more frames per second over quality, but everyone has different priorities.    GTX 1050  \xa0  As you can see, the HP OMEN 15t barely runs PUBG at 60fps under the lowest settings possible. Other games like FIFA 18 and Rocket League ran at well over 90 fps under ultra settings, which was quite impressive. All in all, it’s a pretty capable card, especially considering the price.  Thermals  The GTX 1050 is an average GPU with good thermal performance. The minimal heat it produces is pretty impressive, with temperatures\xa0that never crossed 50 degrees. Ideally, it stays at around 30 under normal usage and goes up to 47-degrees after an hour of intensive gameplay. It also throttles very less. Safe to say it does pretty well with thermals.  Storage  The 1TB of Hard Drive feels a bit feels a bit sluggish though, for eg booting the device will take over 2 minutes and just opening Google Chrome takes about 10 whole seconds. Although it can be fixed by adding an M.2 SSD, which the laptop supports by the way.\xa0I am not saying the laptop is actually slow, but after using machines with SSDs for a few years now, I can’t seem to grasp how slow hard disk storages actually were.  Read More:  Top gaming laptops under 60k  Keyboard and Trackpad  The keyboard was clicky and the typing experience\xa0was satisfying. I also like the 2 levels of backlit keys. The second stage only lights up the WASD keys, which I feel looked good under dark conditions. Then there is the usual red backlit, which comes standard just like on all other gaming laptops.  The trackpad, however, is pretty bad. It has clicky right & left buttons, but the tracking just gives it away. This is one of the worst trackpads I have ever seen on a gaming laptop. The gestures work ok but the tracking feels inconsistent and inaccurate.  Connectivity  I have had no particular connectivity issues, thanks to the HP Omen 15T’s ample ports for all my needs. The USB C port touch is a nice touch although 4 lane PCIe support is optional. The onboard speakers do a decent job. It produces punchy sounds and is acceptably loud. You can’t properly game on it due to the loud fans, but for movies and music, they are fine.  Battery  This laptop comes with a 150w power supply. The charger is sleeker and more compact in size than my 130w charger. The battery life is good for a gaming laptop as I got around 4-5 hours of life under normal usage. Gaming was also possible for around an hour and a half. It’s a 67Whr battery on a gaming laptop so I didn’t expect much at first either.  Conclusion  So, for Rs 1,00,000, you get an i7 7700HQ processor, 8GB of RAM, good thermal performance, a nice keyboard and an entry-level GTX 1050 on the HP Omen 15T. What you don’t get is fast storage. Due to the same reason, the laptop feels sluggish overall, but all you need is an SSD to fix that. The trackpad and display aren’t really something to be proud of either.\xa0      Pros  Cons    Design  Touchpad    Thermals  Display    Connectivity  No SSD      Alternatives  But should you buy it? Well, for the same price you can buy something like the  Acer VX 15  with almost exactly similar specs. So, it’s basically an aesthetical choice, because the VX15 has good thermal performance too. There is also the  Dell 7567  with a GTX 1050Ti but only has a Quad Core i5 processor.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hp-omen-15t.jpg']

['Nokia 7 Plus Review: The Trendy Beast!'],"['Android', 'Nokia', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['June 22, 2018']",2018-06-22 07:35:27+00:00,"['Different. That’s the word that popped in my mind when I held the Nokia 7 Plus for the first time. This new high-end midrange smartphone is quite different than what we usually see with Nokia devices with the elongated display and newer design. So, how does this device perform? Is it as good as Nokia has claimed it to be? Let’s find out in this review.   Nokia 7 Plus Specifications:   Display:\xa0 6″ IPS LCD full HD+ (2160 x 1080, 18:9), Corning Gorilla Glass 3  Storage : 64 GB eMMC 5.1, expandable up to 256 GB  Operating System : Android 8.0 Oreo  CPU:\xa0 Qualcomm Snapdragon 660  RAM:\xa0 4GB LPDDR4  Rear Camera:\xa0 12 MP 1.4µm f/1.75 2PD with ZEISS optics, 13 MP 1.0µm f/2.6 with ZEISS optics, dual-tone flash  Front Camera:\xa0 16 MP with ZEISS optics  Connectivity : 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac WiFI, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS/AGPS+GLONASS+BDS, NFC, 3.5 mm headphone jack  Sensors:\xa0 Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, E-compass, Gyroscope, Fingerprint Sensor, Hall sensor  Cable type:\xa0 USB Type-C (USB 2.0)  Battery:\xa0 3800 mAh battery  Price : Rs. 46,899   Design and Build  The Nokia 7 Plus is a metallic phone that is covered with what Nokia calls ceramic feel coating on its back. This material is just several layers of paint on top of the aluminum. It doesn’t feel like ceramic, but the texture is differently amazing. The phone also has a certain amount of heft to it which I have liked during my time of usage. What remains here from the older Nokia is the sturdy build which I have really liked during my time of using the smartphone.         The device can also handle a few drops here and there, although I suggest handling your phone nicely. Overall, the Nokia 7 Plus is the perfect blend of what the older Nokia stood for and the current trend of 2018.  Display   Now let’s talk about the display of the Nokia 7 Plus. This phone comes with a tall and trendy 6-inch display with minimal bezels that speaks “modern”. I am really into vivid and saturated displays, and the 7 Plus has provided me with that. It is bright and sharp and for what it’s worth, the display is top-quality. However, at times, the display looks so saturated that some colors, take red, for example, look abnormal due to oversaturation. I noticed this while viewing pictures in the gallery. I had previously thought that this saturation was due to the cameras, but viewing it on my laptop, I realized the extent to which the display is saturated. So, even though the quality of this display is top-notch, you might not like the level of saturation at times.  Camera  In the camera department, there are a couple things that were strange here and there in the Nokia 7 Plus. The major problem I had was the difference in the skin tone when I took selfies. However, this issue exists only in group selfies. Nonetheless, the selfies are great with accurate details and just the right amount of sharpness.          The rear side is where things get interesting as the 7 Plus packs two cameras of 12-megapixel and 13-megapixel with Carl Zeiss branding. The secondary camera here acts as a telephoto lens that has 2x optical zoom.  In terms of quality, the Nokia 7 Plus captures pictures with good details, accurate colors and ample saturation. This camera here is well-enough for point and shoot pictures, and if you want to take pictures are per your own liking, there is a pro mode as well where you can adjust the ISO level, shutter speed, and exposure.                The exposure that this rear camera cranks up is helpful during night time as the pictures have a good amount of light in them. I took these samples of Bouddha at 8-ish in the evening and I like how lighted up this roadside is. Now I did face the issue of shaky pictures due to my shaky hands, but the end result was always nice. You get a hint of noise on the objects in the background, but it’s not that noticeable!          Now talking about the portrait mode, the device does justice to the pictures as it can effectively blur out the background of the images. The front camera also takes portrait shots, but it was kind of a mixed bag as you can see from the samples themselves.             Performance and Software  Let’s talk about the software first. The Nokia 7 plus comes under Google’s Android One project and runs stock Android. Being a vanilla Android fan, I really liked using the 7 Plus with its lack of bloatware and smooth performance. This software has helped the processor as well, as the overall performance of the device is flawless. I haven’t experienced lags and the device too hasn’t given up on once.   Nokia 7 Plus Antutu Score  Infogram   Nokia 7 Plus Geekbench Score  Infogram  With the high benchmarks and smooth performance, this device is probably one of the best performing mid-range devices right now.      Nokia 7 Plus UI    1  of 4                                                          Hardware and Security  The Nokia 7 Plus comes with 64 GB of onboard memory which is expandable up to 256 GB. However, Nokia has strangely included a hybrid SIM slot. So, if you want more storage, then you will have to give up on your second SIM card. Sound quality wise, the bottom-firing speaker is kind of loud but don’t expect more from it.   The Nokia 7 Plus has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner which unlocks the smartphone with no issue whatsoever. It is fast and secure. However, if you are into mobile phones featuring face unlock, you might be disappointed to know that the device lacks that security option.  Battery  The Nokia 7 Plus has a huge 3800 mAh battery inside. I was expecting it to completely nail the battery department, but to my surprise, I was disappointed. I got around 5 hours of screen-on-time during my usage which lasted for a day and a half. Maybe this is a flaw with the unit I received as other reviewers have actually praised the battery life, but during my usage, it didn’t impress me as it was only average. But the phone does support Quick Charge 4.0, so the charge will be back up in no time.  Conclusion  So, all in all, I have really liked using this device. It has everything you can ask for in a good mid-range phone, a vivid display, good cameras, smooth performance and stock Android. There are one or two complaints I have with this device, with one being the price itself. I think this device has been overpriced slightly and it would be much better if Paramount decreases the price tag of the 7 Plus but a few thousand bucks. If the company does so, this flagship mid-range will be the best bang-for-buck smartphone right now!  With what the 7 plus has at the helm, it’s one of the nicest smartphones around and you will not regret buying it.

['Oppo Find X launched: A notchless monster with pop up cameras'],['OPPO'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 20, 2018']",2018-06-20 02:10:17+00:00,"['For a long time, we have seen Oppo rolling out camera-centric mid-range smartphones. But this time, Oppo has brought a flagship smartphone with the innovative design in the Oppo Find X smartphone. With this new design language, Oppo has been able to pack the display with the highest screen-to-body ratio in any smartphone.  When the rumors were followed,  Lenovo Z5  was supposed to be a true bezel-less smartphone but that all turned out a hoax at the end. Oppo’s sister company Vivo had also brought a smartphone with near bezel-less display namely known as the  Vivo NEX S . The NEX S had 91.24% screen-to-body ratio, a value, which the tech giants like Apple and Samsung have been craving for a long time now. To increase the screen-to-body ratio,  iPhone X  ditched the Touch ID and came up with a notch up top to adjust the front camera and other sensors. But NEX S did it better without a notch and similar is the case with the Oppo Find X. Vivo NEX S had a motorized selfie shooter but the Find X has the top part of the phone motorized. The crammed up top part of the phone includes all the cameras ( dual rear camera  and a front camera) and other sensors. The motorized part pops up when the feature is accessed.  Design  Credit: The Verge  The most interesting part of the Oppo Find X is its innovative design. To cut down the bezels on the top or the annoying notch, Oppo developed a motorized system that contains 3D face scanning system, 25MP front camera, and 16MP +20MP dual rear camera. These crammed up components motorize up when accessed. They pop up when the phone is tried to unlock or when the camera is accessed.        Display  Oppo Find X comes with the tall 6.42-inch display with the curvy edges just the Samsung Galaxy S9. The display on the Find X possesses the highest screen-to-body ratio in any smartphone. The display on the phone occupies 93.8% of the front area. And that too without a notch. Samsung’s AMOLED panel has been used as display material in the phone, which features Full-HD+ resolution. So the display is surely going to look sharp and vibrant. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on the top to shield the display from the scratches and cracks during the fall.   Security  To evade the security vulnerabilities, Oppo has added the 3D face scanning system just like the iPhone X. The company claims, with this technology, the users can unlock the device merely in 0.5 seconds and that too with great accuracy. That sounds really great but the absence of the fingerprint sensor is really a bummer. Yes, this so-called flagship does not contain any kind of fingerprint sensor (physical fingerprint sensor or an under display one).  Performance  The Find X is flagship by all means. It has the powerful  Snapdragon 845 chipset  with 8GB of RAM alongside. The phone also supports an SD card, which lets the users expand the storage up to 400GB.  Software  On the software side of things, the Find X comes with an Android OS out of the box. To spice up the things on the software in Oppo’s way, Oppo has included its home-baked Color OS on the top. The Color OS highly resembles the UI of the iPhone. We would definitely prefer the stock version of Android. Nonetheless, it is not the worst UI by any means.  Camera  Credit: The Verge  Oppo has a great history of providing a remarkable set of cameras in its mid-range handsets. And in its flagship model, the smartphone maker does not disappoint either. In terms of camera, the Find X employs a camera pair with 20MP and 16MP sensors at the back, both of them furnished by f/2.0 aperture. And up front, there is a whopping 25MP camera for the selfies and video calling. Since the cameras are crammed up inside the phone, they only pop up when the feature is accessed.  Battery  We have seen numerous flagships with a ton of appealing features but falling short in delivering the horsepower. But that’s not the case with the Oppo Find X. The handset has stuffed an ample 3730mAh battery to suffice the needs of the users so that the users do not need to run towards the charger every now and then. Also, the smartphone has included a VOOC technology to charge the device quickly. With the VOOC technology, the charger injects 20-watt power (5V/4A) to speed up the charging process.  Oppo Find X Specifications   Dimensions : 156.7 x 74.2 x 9.6 mm;\xa0 Weight : 186 grams  Display : 6.42-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display; 93.8% screen to body ratio, Protected with Gorilla Glass 5  Resolution : 1080 x 2340 pixels, 19.5:9 aspect ratio @401ppi  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 845  CPU : Octa-core (4×2.8 GHz Kryo 385 Gold & 4×1.7 GHz Kryo 385 Silver)  OS : ColorOS 5.1 based on Android Oreo (v8.1)  RAM : 8 GB  GPU : Adreno 630  Storage : 256 GB (expandable up to 400 GB)  Rear Camera : Dual: 16 MP (f/2.0, PDAF, OIS) + 20 MP (f/2.0), phase detection autofocus, dual-LED dual-tone flash (Pop-up Camera)  Front camera : 25MP, f/2.0  Sensors : Face ID, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:\xa0 Dual Hybrid SIM with 4G  Connectivity: Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, A-GPS, NFC, USB Type-C, no 3.5mm headphone jack  Battery : 3730 mAh Non-removable Li-Po battery with VOOC (5V/4A) fast charging technology  Colors : Bordeaux Red, Glacier Blue   Oppo Find X: Oops and Wows      Oops  Wows    No 3.5mm headphone jack  Fantastic no bezel design    No fingerprint sensor  Clever Pop up cameras    No wireless charging  Plenty of power']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/oppo-find-x-price-nepal.jpg']

One of the most anticipated flagship smartphones of 2018, the P20 Pro looks set to give a tough competition to the Samsung  Galaxy S9 Plus  and the  iPhone X .   Overview  The major talking point of the Huawei P20 Pro is its triple cameras on the back. These cameras have given the device a DxoMark score of 109, winning it the title of the best camera smartphone on paper. The P20 Pro is equipped with a collective 40-megapixel color sensor, 20-megapixel monochrome lens, and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens. These cameras are Leica-branded and have the capability of up to 5x Hybrid zoom. The smartphone also has a dedicated Night mode which Huawei is boasting about, which we will be talking about in our full review. In front lies a 24-megapixel with which you can expect some crisp selfies.        In the display department, the Huawei P20 Pro sports a 6.1-inch OLED display with full HD+ resolution. Now a flagship device featuring a full HD display could be a strange choice, but that depends on the real-life usage. The P20 Pro follows the 2018 trend of featuring a notch on top with minimal bezels on the other sides. However, unlike other manufacturers, Huawei has added a front-mounted fingerprint scanner.   This device is cloaked by a glass back with Huawei only launching the much-talked-about Twilight color edition in Nepal.  Internals-wise, the Huawei P20 Pro is powered by an Octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 970 processor coupled with 6 GB of RAM and Mali-G72 MP12 GPU. Storage-wise, it comes with 128 GB of internal memory. The P20 Pro runs on Android v8.1 Oreo with EMUI 8.1 on top as the skin.  The Huawei P20 Pro is backed up by a huge 4,000 mAh battery which will probably provide excellent battery life. Also, it has Huawei’s own fast charging enabled. Now, at a time when smartphone manufacturers are opting for a slimmer device with a smaller battery, Huawei has included a large battery in its flagship phone which is certainly commendable.  Huawei P20 Pro Price in Nepal   The Huawei P20 Pro is available in 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM variant, and Huawei has priced the device at Rs. 99,900 in Nepal. With the price tag, the smartphone goes directly up against the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus which also sells for Rs. 99,900.  Huawei P20 Pro Specifications:   Display : 6.1-inch full HD+ (1080 x 2240 pixels) OLED display, 18.7:9 aspect ratio  CPU : Octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 970  OS : Android Oreo (v8.1) with EMUI 8.1 on the top  RAM : 6 GB  GPU : Mali-G72 MP12  Storage : 128 GB  Rear Camera : 40 MP with f/1.8 aperture + 20 MP with f/1.6 aperture + 8 MP with f/2.4 aperture, Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), up to 5x Hybrid Zoom, PDAF, LED flash  Front Camera : 24 MP front-facing camera, f/2.0 aperture  Sensors : Fingerprint, Accelerometer, Gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:  Dual SIM with 4G  IP67 Dust and Water Resistant  Battery : 4,000 mAh with Fast Charging Support  Latest Price: Rs. 99,900 [Last updated on: July 25, 2018]']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/huawei-p20-price-price-in-nepal.jpg']

The device is rumored to go for sales later this year. It is said that the phone is codenamed being called “the winner”. We also heard from Samsung that the device will have a 7.3-inch OLED screen and upon folding it, it will become 4.3-inches. Similarly, when not in use, the secondary display can be turned into a touchpad. Likewise, there is a pin holding the two phones together and the sides can be folded inwards or outwards. Interestingly, upon being folded, the smartphone is said to resemble a wallet in looks!

The price of this smartphone is said to be around $1800.  Koh Dong-Jin (the president of business at Samsung Electronics) said, “the company is setting its eyes on 2018 to release the ‘holy grail’ of a smartphone with a bendable display”.

According to the latest teaser, Oppo Find X will be coming with  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 , 8 GB RAM, and 256 GB of internal storage. But that’s not where it stops.  The Oppo Find X will be coming with many other intriguing features. Here is what we know about Find X.         The 5x Zoom  Oppo Find X will feature the 5x Dual camera zoom which was even presented at MWC 2017 (Barcelona). This particular zoom technology especially concerns dual cameras and uses the periscope-style structure. The\xa05.7mm thick 5x zoom is a telescopic lens which uses a prism to direct light to its sensor at the angle of 90 o . This will actually offer 3x optical zoom but an additional 2x software-enhanced zoom is used to obtain 5x magnification. This gives the advantage to give enough space for the zoom without giving up quality and slenderness.  Super VOOC Charging  As innovative as 5x dual camera zoom is, Oppo has also developed a technology which will leave you in awe. VOOC concerns fast recharging of the battery of the smartphone. The Super VOOC is competent to fully charge a 2500 mAh battery in about 15 minutes. Oppo Find x is powered by 3645 mAh battery which can fully charge from 0-100 within 30 minutes.

The major highlight of this smartphone is certainly its 91.24% screen-to-body ratio.  Vivo Nex Specifications  The Vivo Nex is available in three different variants, two high-end models, and one mid-range model. The high-end model, the Nex S, is powered by Snapdragon 845 chipset and is available with 8 GB of RAM and 256 or 128 GB of storage variants. The mid-range Nex A comes with Snapdragon 710 chipset and 6 GB of RAM which works alongside Adreno 616 GPU. The Nex runs on Android v8.1 Oreo out of the box with an AI-enabled Energy UI on top.  But the major talking point is certainly the display. This bezel-less beauty has screen spread all over its top making up for the 91.24% screen-body ratio. This 6.59-inch display with 1080 x 2316 pixels resolution is a  Super AMOLED  panel which is certainly an icing on the cake.        Now you might wonder how the buyers will make a call via this smartphone. Well, the Chinese company has embedded a Screen SoundCasting Technology on the device where the screen acts as an earpiece itself.   For capturing selfies, Vivo has included a mechanical camera which pops up when a user opens the front-facing camera. This 8-megapixel camera can automatically open when whenever someone wants to take a selfie. I am still skeptic about this camera, as anything mechanical might stop working somewhere in the near future.  Like a couple of new Vivo smartphones, the Nex also features an in-display fingerprint scanner. There is, however, no facial unlock as it would make no sense to just pop up the camera for unlocking the smartphone.  Vivo has also managed to include its very own assistant, Jovi. There is a separate physical button on the side just to trigger it. This assistant, according to Vivo, works with intelligence as it can learn what the user wants from it over time.  Talking about the rear-facing camera, well its vertical setup is similar to the one on the  Vivo V9 . The device has dual lenses on the back measuring 12- and 5-megapixel with f/1.8 and f/2.4 aperture respectively. The former also has an Optical Image Stabilization feature. There is a 4,000 mAh battery on Nex which with the full HD+ display, should last for a day.  Vivo Nex Pricing and Availability  Vivo has priced the high-end Nex S at 4998 Yuan for the 256 GB variant, while the 128 GB version goes on sale for 4498 Yuan which convert to $780 and $702 approximately. The variant with Snapdragon 710 chipset inside will run for 3898 Yuan which translates to $609. The pre-order for the devices start from today in China, its international availability, however, hasn’t been mentioned by Vivo.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vivo-nex-launched.jpg']

Among which, there were four particular processors related\xa0events that caught our attention. The first was  Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 850 , then AMD’s new processor which we get to after this, the third is Intel’s 28 core 56 thread mammoth, and lastly the new Intel Core i7-8086k limited edition processor.  The 8086k isn’t a mass production processor for an everyday PC user. It is more Intel’s way of celebrating their 50 years in the industry. Although the main reason remains their 40th anniversary of the 8086 microprocessor. The same processor that gave rise to Intel’s wildly successful x86 architecture, still in use till this day.  Talking about its technical specifications, you get a six-core CPU with 12 threads. The base clocks remain at a mere 4 GHz but will boost up-to 5 GHz without overclocking. The processor will run on any Intel 300 series motherboards (LGA 1151). Though if you plan to overclock it, you will specifically need the Z370 motherboard.        The processor is based on the Coffee Lake  14nm architecture , still no canon lake. It has 12MB of L3 cache size and a TDP of 95W. It even comes with Intel UHD graphics 630 integrated GPU solution.   The processor will need some serious cooling, yet don’t expect a cooler out of the box. More so if you want to actually overclock the unlocked beast. Finally, the processor supports DDR4 RAM, weights about 12 ounces and has a dimension of 4.6 x 4 x 2.8 inches, in case you were wondering.  The CPU is already up for grabs in several online websites across the US. Sadly, their availability is questionable outside America. Sources claim Intel will only produce a total of just 50,000 units, out of which 8086 units will be given away to 8086 lucky winners. The processor is listed for a price of $424.99 if you feel like upgrading.

The first smartphone from that series,  the Z1  gained popularity mostly due to a support for Moto mod, a magnetic accessory that provides the smartphone with an extra feature. And continuing that trend, the Chinese company has launched the Z3 Play, a mid-range smartphone with flagships like features and a $500 price tag.  The Moto Z3 Play comes with a 6.01-inch  Super AMOLED  display with full HD+ resolution that speaks 2018 with the minimal bezels on the top and bottom. This display has an aspect ratio of 18:9 and a 402 ppi density. For protection, Motorola has covered the display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Inside lies an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor with 1.8 GHz of clock speed. For the graphical purpose, there is the Adreno 509 alongside it. We have seen Xiaomi use the same processor on the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI  which is already available in Nepal. This processor is supported by 4 GB of RAM. However, the storage option Motorola has included on the Z3 Play is quite strange, as the $500 smartphone features 32 and 64 GB of onboard memory. There is, however, an option to expand it via a microSD card slot. As for the operating system, the Moto Z3 Play runs on a near stock Android 8.1 (Oreo).         On the optics side, the Moto Z3 Play is equipped with a 12- and 5-megapixel rear-facing cameras. The 12MP camera has f/1.7 aperture and has dual pixel phase detection autofocus enabled. This camera is supported by a dual-tone dual-LED flash system. In front lies an 8-megapixel selfie shooter with f/2.0 aperture which is capable of shooting 1080p videos.  The Moto Z3 Play houses a 3,000 mAh battery which is fast charging enabled. If a user wishes to increase the battery life, they can, of course, the Moto Mod meant for increasing the battery life. This battery is chargeable via a USB Type C connector.  With the $499 price tag, Moto Z3 Play has entered the OnePlus territory as the company has priced its new phone, the  OnePlus 6  at $529.

['Samsung announces Galaxy J3 2018 and Galaxy J7 2018'],['Samsung'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 9, 2018']",2018-06-08 18:25:44+00:00,"['Samsung has been violently announcing and launching the smartphones these days. The smartphone giant has already launched a lot of handsets in the J-series lineup:  Galaxy J2 2018 ,  Galaxy J4 ,  Galaxy J6 ,  Galaxy J7 Duo ,  Galaxy J8  are the few new names in the lineup.\xa0 After all these launches, many of us were thinking Samsung has been all done in the mid-range section this year. Now, proving all of us wrong, Samsung announced two new handsets (again). The new handsets to be launched are the Samsung Galaxy J3 2018 and the Galaxy J7 2018, the successor to the J3 2017 and the  Galaxy J7 2017  respectively.  Also Read:  Samsung Mobiles Price in Nepal  Samsung announced these handsets vaguely on its website . Samsung, via its website, has promised sharp displays, great low-light cameras, expandable memory and a dependable battery life. However, when looked at the specs, the features on the handsets are not much of an upgrade over its predecessors.        Samsung Galaxy J3 2018  The Samsung Galaxy J3 2018 comes with a 5.0-inch display, which features the HD resolution. Samsung has not quite spoken anything about the aspect ratio. So we might guess it to possess the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. And the generous bezels on the forehead and the chin cues the same. J7 2018 also comes with the similar story: HD display and rich on bezels. But the distinguishing thing on the J7 2018 is the tall 5.5-inch display. Samsung has not divulged anything regarding the display material, but we can expect it to be Super AMOLED panels as the last generation J3 and J7 had Super AMOLED displays.  Samsung Galaxy J7 2018 Display  In terms of camera, the J3 2018 comes with an 8MP (f/1.9) camera at the back and 5MP (f/2.2) up front. The rear camera is low on megapixel count when compared to its predecessor as the J3 2017 had a 13MP rear camera with the same size of the aperture (f/1.9). But Samsung has promised crispier images and great low light shots from this new handset. So we can expect something positive from this newbie.    And talking about the camera on the J7 2018, it is the same setup when looked at the number. The rear camera on the device comes with the 13MP sensor and f/1.7 aperture. And there is another 13MP camera on the front. The selfie shooter comes with f/1.9 aperture. Both of these handsets will come with the Samsung Knox, the feature, which with Samsung boasts to provide defense-grade, multilayered protection.  “When it comes to smartphones, we know that one size doesn’t fit all. The Galaxy lineup is designed to give consumers the flexibility to choose the phone that best fits their needs,”\xa0said\xa0Justin Denison, senior vice president, Mobile Product Strategy and Marketing at Samsung Electronics America.\xa0“The J3 delivers high-quality features at a great price, and the J7 with its huge HD screen and amazing, advanced camera, is built for users who want more.”  When looked at the specs, there is nothing to get excited about the Samsung Galaxy J3 2018 and the J7 2018. It vaguely looks like the last year’s J3 and J7 just with the 2018 suffix. But since most of the features of the handsets are still under the veil, we cannot yet make a remark. Let’s hope the hooded features will cheer the Samsung fanbase and save us from disappointment.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/samsung-galaxy-j3-2018-j7-2018.jpg']
['Huawei Nova 3e Review: The Shiny Star'],"['Android', 'Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['June 8, 2018']",2018-06-08 06:11:42+00:00,"['The  Huawei Nova 3e , also named as the P20 Lite, is Huawei’s latest mid-range offering. In the specs sheet, it has everything you can ask for, a great camera, a shiny glass back design, fast charging support, and a trendy display. So, how do these specifications emulate in real life? I have used the Nova 3e for around a month now and here is my full review.   Huawei Nova 3e Specifications:   Display : 5.84-inch FullHD+ IPS (1080*2160), 19:9 aspect ratio  SIM : Hybrid Dual Nano (SIM+SIM or SIM +microSD)  OS : EMUI 8.0 on top of Android 8.0 Oreo  Fingerprint Sensor : Rear Mounted  Chipset :\xa0HiSilicon Kirin 659  CPU :\xa0Octa-core (4×2.36 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU :\xa0Mali-T830 MP2  RAM : 4GB  Storage : 64GB, Expandable with microSD up to 256GB  Rear Camera: \xa016MP + 2MP Dual Camera, Phase Detection Autofocus, Bokeh mode, Motion Photos, 1080p @30fps  Front Camera : 16MP, f/2.0 aperture, Stickers, Beauty Mode, 1080p @30fps  Connectivity : Dual Hybrid SIM (4G) Bluetooth 4.2, USB Type C  Battery : 3000mAh  Price:  Rs. 35,900   Camera         Let’s talk about the cameras on this device first. Being the lite variant of the P20, I had a lot of expectations from this device. And the pictures did meet my expectations. There were ample saturations on images and the sharpening was kind of on point as well. However, it sometimes couldn’t determine the necessary exposure level due to which the pictures were a bit overexposed at times, like the one with my dog.      Huawei Nova 3e | Portrait Samples   1  of 3                                                Talking about the pictures of the portrait mode, well, it’s a mixed bag. Sometimes, the device was capable of producing images such as this where it was intelligent enough to notice even the thread of the t-shirt in this picture while sometimes, it couldn’t determine where the depth was necessary like in this picture. Like with every midrange phone, portrait, as well as the normal shorts, were noisy and grainy. So, overall, the Nova 3e is a great camera that does wonders during the daytime, but at night, you might not like the outcomes.      Huawei Nova 3e Camera Sample   1  of 4                                                          In front lies a 16MP camera, which does a great job. Outdoors, the selfies are pleasing to the eyes with the right skin tone and sharpness. Oh, and there’s this feature which Huawei calls the AR lens which basically applies various filters on your face and in the background.      Huawei Nova 3e | Selfie Sample   1  of 3                                                Check out all the high-resolution camera samples\xa0 here .  Display   And the other major talking point of this device is the notched display. Huawei has included an option to black out the top of the display. This display is bright and sharp, and the contrast ratio is quite respectable. But I would have liked a little more saturation just to see the colors pop, but that’s just me. Unlike the iPhone X, the videos played on this display isn’t obstructed by the notch which is nice to see. And with the 5.8 display that has minimal bezels, the Nova 3e feels quite compact on hands which is a boon in the day of taller smartphones.  Performance and Software  The major area where the Nova 3e has fallen short is on the performance front. The device is powered by an octa-core Kirin 659 chipset which we have already seen Huawei use in quite a lot of smartphones. Now, I am not saying that this chipset is bad. It tends to warm up sometimes around the fingerprint sensor, but there is nothing to worry about.  The 3e has handled light usage nicely, but once you try to do some heavy tasks or run heavy games like, say, PubG, you will feel the need of a better processor right away, even in the graphical side, the frame rates drop as the smartphone kind of has issues handling the graphical necessities.      Huawei Nova 3e | Software UI   1  of 6                                                                              The software you see on this device is the EMUI 8 on top of Android Oreo 8.0. Huawei’s skin is getting better every year and we see that example on this device. It has only a few bloatware, and you can remove some of the pre-installed applications as per your liking. The software also has a few features up its sleeve like lift to wake, motion control and face unlock to name a few.   Huawei Nova 3e Benchmark Comparison  Infogram  The Antutu Benchmark score clearly showcases the performance champion!   Huawei Nova 3e Geekbench Benchmark Comparison  Infogram  Geekbench also gave the Oppo F7 a higher score than the Nova 3e.   Huawei Nova 3e Basemark X  Infogram  Even on the graphical side, the cheaper Nokia 6.1 clearly comes out as the winner here.  Design   Now just because the performance is average, doesn’t necessarily mean that the Nova 3e is a bad device. This display is connected with the back panel by a metallic rail that’s in between the glass front and glass back. Now Huawei is probably the only manufacturer in this price range to offer a glass on the back of its smartphone, and when I held the phone, it felt quite premium for its price tag. And if you are looking forward to buying this smartphone, I will certainly suggest the blue color variant as it looks shiny and quite a bit attractive. And like the  P20 and P20 Pro , the emblems have been moved to the side as well, probably to make the phone look like a camera when you hold it in landscape orientation. Overall, with the glass back and the notched design, the Nova 3e is a proper 2018 smartphone.  Hardware and Security   In terms of storage, the Huawei Nova 3e has 64 GB of onboard memory which is expandable up to 256 GB. It would be really exciting if Huawei launches the 128 GB storage variant in the near future.  Now talking about the speaker, well, there’s nothing new here. Huawei has gone with the same bottom firing speaker, which gets covered easily. Also, this speaker can only fill a small quiet room.  Talking about the face unlock, the Nova 3e just takes a bit more time to unlock. Well, the face unlock aren’t to be trusted, but hey, they work 100% of the time. And if you are not that into face unlock, there is a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner on the device, which also works all the time.  Connectivity  In terms of connectivity, let’s talk about call quality first. I used the Huawei Nova 3e as my primary driver for a few weeks and I have no issues with it. The person on the other end also didn’t face any problem. However, the issue here lies with the dual hybrid SIM slot. As the user of SIMs of two telecommunication companies, I had to give up on expandable memory just to use the two cards which were kind of a bummer.  Battery   On the battery department, Huawei has included a 3,000mAh battery inside which lasted me for around 4 hours 30 minutes to 5 hours depending on my usage. I would have certainly liked a bigger battery here like the one in the Nova 2i, but Huawei has compensated that with the inclusion of the company’s fast charging technology. The charger that comes with the box can fully charge the phone in around 2 hours which is faster than what its competitors offer. So, if you can ignore the battery size, the Nova 3e has the upper hand.  Conclusion  Smartphone distributors have now penetrated into a new mid-range price segment which starts from Rs. 30,000. The devices that fall in this price range have tried to emulate a few flagship features.  The Huawei Nova 3e falls under the same category. But even with only a couple of competitors right now, the device is under a lot of pressure. And for what it’s worth, I think the Nova 3e is a good device. It has one of the best designs on a mid-range smartphone, and its cameras are good. However, it has a dated chipset that has slightly hampered the performance front and maybe the battery size could have been bigger.  So, in the end, it all comes down to whether or not I would suggest this smartphone to someone? \xa0Well, that depends. If you want a smartphone with a sophisticated design and reliable camera, then Nova 3e is the one for you. However, if you are into heavy games and want a bigger battery size then you might want to look elsewhere.

['Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo Full Review: Plain Vanilla'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 8, 2018']",2018-06-07 19:39:31+00:00,"['Nowadays,  mid-range smartphones  come with remarkable cameras, capable processor, and many other interesting features inside. Such promising features have obviously been thinning the gap between the mid-range and flagship smartphones and leaving people fewer choices to opt for a flagship device. And in the tangled mess of feature-packed mid-range smartphones, Samsung has made an attempt to stay in the competition with its recently launched Galaxy J7 Duo. Samsung has praised highly of the processor and cameras on the phone and promised to deliver impressive performance in the respective areas. With such features, can the  J7 duo  untangle itself from the crowded mess of mid-range handsets and supersede in the competition? Let’s find in this review.   Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo specifications:   OS : Android Oreo 8.0  Body : Plastic Back  Chipset : Exynos 7885  CPU : Octa-core (4 X 1.56Ghz Cortex A53 + 4 X 1.6Ghz Cortex A73)  GPU : Mali-G71  Display : 5.5 inches Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors, multitouch  Screen resolution : 720×1280 pixels with 16:9 aspect ratio (267 ppi density)  RAM : 4 GB  ROM : 32 GB extendable up to 256 GB (dedicated microSD card slot)  Selfie camera : 8 MP f/1.9, LED flash  Rear camera : 13+5 MP dual f/1.9 with autofocus, LED flash, live focus, Geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, panorama, etc.  Video : 1080p @30fps  Battery : 3000 mAh non-removable Li-on battery  USB : Micro- USB 2.0, USB On-The-Go  Bluetooth : 4.2, A2DP, LE  Sensors : Fingerprint (front-mounted), Accelerometer, Proximity,  Network : GSM/ HSPA/ LTE  WLAN : WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, WiFi direct, hotspot  Price : Rs. 28,890   Design and build  we have seen quite awe-inspiring upgrades in the J7 series over the years. The last year’s  J7 Max  and  J7 Pro  smartphones had a metallic body and they felt quite premium on the hold and on the use. However, in the J7 Duo, Samsung downgraded from metallic unibody to the removable plastic back.         Also, in the smartphone market, we can also see a numerous handsets boasting narrow bezels and the display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Well, the Galaxy J7 Duo is certainly not one of them. The smartphone comes with generous bezels on the top and the bottom and a display befitted between the bezels in a conventional 16:9 aspect ratio. So when I looked at the design on the J7 Duo, I find it really unconvincing of Samsung to provide such outdated design in its popular smartphone series.  Display  In terms of display, the J7 Duo comes with a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED panel up front. However, the resolution is only HD. Since almost all the smartphones at the similar price are opting for a Full-HD display, the presence of merely an HD display on the device got me disheartened when I first looked into the specs. However, on the use, I did not find the lack of sharpness on the phone. With the Super AMOLED panel, the display looked vivid with darker blacks, brighter whites and with the impressive color reproduction. And I was pretty satisfied with the display on the J7 Duo during the course of the review period.   Furthermore, the smartphone also comes with a decent amount of brightness. I didn’t find any trouble on viewing and reading the content on the screen even in the bright daylight But it was really sad to see the lack of Ambient light sensor on the smartphone. I find it really annoying to adjust the brightness every now and then. Come on Samsung, at least, be generous on providing the necessary sensors.  Performance  Samsung had been quite obsessed with the Exynos 7870 chipset in the past. And almost all the previous version of the J7 smartphones were provided with the same chipset. But things have changed in the J7 Duo. Samsung has provided a capable Exynos 7885 chipset in the handset, which was previously provided only in the premium mid-range smartphones like the  Galaxy A8 & A8 Plus . However, the cores in the J7 Duo are under-clocked as compared to the A8 smartphones. Underclocking has made the processor power efficient without a compromise in the performance.  Benchmark scores (AnTuTu: left, BasemarkOS II: middle, Geekbench: right)  Since the Samsung has shown high hopes regarding the Exynos 7885 chipset, we tried to unveil the features and to find its true potential. Fabricated with the 14nm architecture, the chipset possesses all the latest features. And counting on its potential, the performance of the chipset lies somewhere between the Snapdragon 630 and 636 chipsets. When the benchmark scores of the J7 Duo was compared with the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI , the J7 Duo was not far behind the Note 5 AI.    Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo Benchmark Scores  Infogram  Not just in benchmarks, the Exynos 7885 is also a capable performer in the real world. It does the tasks assigned to it quite smoothly and gracefully. Graphics-intensive games like PUBG, Dead Trigger 2, and Asphalt 8 were playable with a remarkable fluidity. Multitasking was also a delightful experience on the phone. All thanks to its ample 4GB of RAM. But considering the memory provided, the J7 Duo is quite low on storage as compared to the competition. It merely has 32GB of onboard storage. Nonetheless, the storage can be expanded up to 256GB and a dedicated SD card slot has been provided for the purpose.  Software  On the software side, J7 Duo comes with Android Oreo out of the box. And to spice the user experience, Samsung has added its home-baked Experience UI on the top. The UI comes with numerous bloatware. But not to worry, most of them can be uninstalled quite easily. The pre-installed apps are not so unique in terms of feature and their presence did not seem much important to me. Some of the pre-installed apps are even redundant and seems like they are there only to challenge the Google ecosystem. So I find most of the pre-installed apps clunky and I uninstalled or disabled almost all of such apps.      Samsung J7 Duo Software   1  of 6                                                                              But among all, I find myself using the S health app the most. The app is really handy for the users, who are conscious about the health. This  health app  basically focuses on tracking the wellness of the users by estimating the calorie intake, water intake, calorie burned, etc. on any given day.  Camera  Samsung has always been a remarkable performer in the photography department. And the tradition continued in the J7 Duo. It is the first Samsung smartphone in Nepal with a  dual camera setup  at the back. The camera pair at the back comprises the 13MP and 5MP camera, both of which are gifted with a wide f/1.9 aperture. The rear camera on the J7 Duo packs in abundant details in the images with decent color accuracy. The shutter speed on the device is also really snappy so I did not find any issues regarding the shutter lags. Also, the smartphone is quite deliberate on capturing images with high dynamic ranges.

The portrait images can be taken from the phone by selecting the Live Focus option. When I tested Live Focus feature, I was impressed by the way it performed. The setup blends in the subject details and depth information so sophisticatedly to provide impressive Bokeh effect. I found edge detection issues only on rare occasions. And such issues was not much of a problem since Samsung has provided the feature to readjust focus area and blur intensity in the portrait images even after taking the shots.      Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo portait selfies   1  of 4                                                          Up front, there is an 8MP camera for video calling and for the selfies. The selfie shooter does not possess the beauty mode but images seem beautified with enriched skin tones and smoothened facial skin. Despite the beautification, the sharpness remains intact, so the images remain pleasing most of the times. Despite the presence of a single camera, the selfie shooter also captures portrait selfies. The Bokeh selfies look really great, but since the feature is a result of the software tweaks, the edge detection is not entirely accurate. After taking numerous portrait selfies, I found a greater accuracy in the close-up selfies with few faces on it.  Check out all the high-resolution camera samples  here .  Battery  The fuel the processes inside the phone, the J7 Duo is provided with a 3000mAh battery. With the HD Super AMOLED display and a power-efficient processor, I had a lot of expectation regarding the battery backup on the phone. But the battery did not back me the way I expected. With a Screen-on-Time of 4.5 hours and backup for less than a day on the normal usage, the battery falls on the average standard. It is implausible of Samsung to downgrade the battery size of 3600mAh on J7 Pro and 3300mAh on the J7 2016 to 3000mAh on the J7 Duo.   But smaller battery also has an advantage. With the smaller battery capacity, a smartphone requires relatively less time to charge the battery. In case of J7 Duo, it takes around 2 hours to charge the device from 0 to 100% with the stock charger of 5V and 2A. Since the smartphone comes with a removable battery, users can buy an extra battery and swap them in need if they are impatient to charge their device continuously for 2 hours.  Conclusion  To sum it up, the J7 Duo is surely not an all-rounder phone and we cannot expect it to please every kind of users. The outdated design, HD resolution, and smaller battery may not be the justifying features in the price point.

But the real headline here is Qualcomm’s partnership with Microsoft to push mobile platform for Always-Connected Windows 10 devices.  Hopefully, we will start seeing more Windows 10 machines running on Snapdragon processors. We have seen a few Windows-on-ARM devices powered\xa0by the  Snapdragon 835 chipset , and the 850 is here to replace the same. Qualcomm basically expects more 2-in-1 devices to employ their SD850, you know, like Microsoft’s own surface books. You can check Qualcomm’s own reference design below.  The Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 allows for sleeker, more portable laptops with fanless designs which can sustain a much higher clock speed for a lot longer. We cannot compare this to the 845, but we will with the SD835. It boasts 20% better battery life,\xa0around 30% performance improvements and 20% faster peak data transfers compared to the 835.        Technically the Snapdragon 850 is built on the same 10nm process and features the X20 modem from the 845. It is also meant to be the second generation processor for “Always Connected PC (ACPC)” platform. You will also find all the upgraded audio and video codec features that we saw on the SD845.  In Window’s April 2018 update, Microsoft will optimize its software to work well with Snapdragon processors. There are also a lot of hardware-based accelerations that will help achieve an even better user experience. The usual AI and machine learning capabilities also make an appearance.  Basically, Qualcomm with the help of Microsoft wants these traditional PC-based\xa0companies to shift to more mobile-focused companies. So, expect a lot of companies to come on board in the near future. Qualcomm is offering a lot more assistance to the OEMs to make better use of its (Qualcomm’s) components.

Considering the market trend, when the flagship smartphones are crossing the $1000 benchmark, OnePlus packs in comparable features in its $500 (around) handset. Because of such endeavors, the smartphone brand is also hailed with the “flagship killer” status.  This time, the smartphone brand brought the new descendent well suited for 2018. Namely known as  OnePlus 6 , the device has got all (or many) of the desirable features. And iHub Pvt. Ltd. might have gone through plenty of hurdles as the store bought the smartphone in Nepal in less than two weeks of the global launch of the handset. So iHub surely deserves a galore of applause. However, the tech community and the OnePlus fan-base in Nepal were not quite pleased with the launch. And in our poll, maximum of them voted OnePlus 6 as the wallet killer rather as the flagship killer (54% over 46% while writing this article). So here are our thoughts on the poll results. Please keep reading till the end of the article. [socialpoll id=”2505116″] OnePlus always brings smartphones that are worthy of money spend on it. It is one of the very few brands, which provides top-grade specifications at nearly half the price of the popular flagship handsets. OnePlus did not change its attitude even while launching the  OnePlus 6 . When the smartphone titans like Apple and Samsung are marking their handsets with over $1000 price tags, OnePlus 6 came as an underdog at merely $529 for its base variant (6/64GB). And the Nepali tech enthusiasts were quite excited to know about the soon arrival of the handset. I too was excited about the launch and was planning to own the OnePlus 6 as my next daily driver.        But the excitement escalated quickly and that happened just by looking at its price. iHub (the authority to launch the OnePlus 6 in Nepal) marked the handset with an exorbitant price tag of Rs. 70,999 (for mirror black 6/64GB variant) in Nepal. And at that price, there is no value added services like the breakage insurance Furthermore, no additional accessories are provided.\xa0iHub Pvt. Ltd. could have made the product online exclusive as the online purchase is quite on the trend. Doing so might have cut down the margin allocated for numerous middle parties. But that’s not the case here. I or GadgetByte Nepal has no personal or professional grudge against the iHub or the with the OnePlus products, but it is really disappointing to see the value-driven products like the OnePlus 6 at such an extravagant price.  Also Read:\xa0 OnePlus Mobiles Price in Nepal  Well, the price for the OnePlus 6 is obviously too much. $529 is approximately equal to Rs. 56,950 in Nepal [1 USD = 107.74]. Even in India, the similar variant is available for INR 34,999, which equals NRs. 56,000 in the direct translation. So the price difference of Rs. 15,000 (approx.) and an exorbitant price tag of the OnePlus 6 in Nepal is obviously unconvincing. So it is really unpersuasive to witness the launch the flagship killer smartphone at the price, where one can easily buy some of the popular flagship handsets.  Vatsal Impex Pvt. Ltd. (authorized distributor of Xiaomi products in Nepal) also had a similar history of pricing the Xiaomi products. But since the day Xiaomi appointed Teletalk Pvt. Ltd. as the second authorized distributor for Nepal, it started selling the smartphones at remarkably lower prices as compared to the Vatsal pricing. After the changed pricing, Xiaomi smartphones are somewhat dominating the  lower mid-range  and  budget smartphones  category these days.  Also Read:\xa0 Xiaomi Mobiles Price in Nepal [Vatsal Vs Teletalk Pricing]  Is it necessary for a similar step in the case of OnePlus too? If a new distributor could bring so much of competition in the market and can bring the prices so down in such a less time then can we expect something similar from the OnePlus? Drop your thoughts (or frustration) regarding the OnePlus 6 price in Nepal in the comment section. And do present your honest opinion on mitigating similar unconvincing pricing here in Nepal.

They claim to reduce app load time to zero thanks to the same AI integration.\xa0Overall it comes with a bunch of other under the hood optimizations delivering a much faster and lightweight UI.  Alongside that, you also get a new voice assistant that can do tasks like read messages or give you live traffic updates among others. It’s basically Xioami’s version of Google Assistant or Siri or the Bixby. They did show a few demos of what the assistant is capable of, and it was pretty promising.

Despite being a budget phone, it follows the trend of dual cameras, 18:9 display, and sleek design. It’s likely to go head to head against  Xiaomi Redmi 5  and Huawei’s budget  Honor lineup .  The Meizu M6T sports a 5.7-inch with HD+ resolution which is acceptable for a budget phone. It is powered by last year’s MediaTek\xa0MT6750, which I think Meizu could have done slightly better. I would prefer the Snapdragon 450 or the recently announced  Helio P22 , but since its an affordable phone, the MT6750 should provide enough horsepower.         The main highlight of the phone has to be its camera. The phone features a dual camera setup of 13MP and 2MP. The primary 13MP camera is a Sony IMX278 sensor and the 2MP is a depth sensor. The combination should yield decent portrait images. There’s an 8MP shooter up front.  Like with any budget phones, the Meizu M6T also houses a plastic body, but it does look good with its unibody construction. It is available in three color options: Black, Red, and Gold. There’s 3300mAh battery which should be enough for a day’s usage. It runs on Android 8.1 Oreo with Meizu’s own flyme OS.  There are three memory versions for the Meizu M6T. The base 3GB/32GB version costs\xa0$125, the 4GB/32GB is priced at\xa0$155, and the 4GB/64GB carries a price tag of\xa0$171.

Because of such endeavors, the brand is also remarked as the flagship killer. And this time around, this popular smartphone brand came up with the  OnePlus 6 . The smartphone was launched globally in the third week of May. In less than two weeks of time, the smartphone is now available in Nepal.  Also Read:  OnePlus Mobiles Price in Nepal  Oneplus 6 Overview:  Design  In terms of design, the OnePlus 6 comes in an all-alluring glass body with Corning Gorilla 5 on both ends. In the past, OnePlus had been quite fixated with the metallic body despite the leap of other top-tier smartphone brands like Samsung and Apple. This time, OnePlus finally made the switch and it received galore of applauds from the fanbase. But despite the fancy upgrade, there is still not the wireless charging feature. Also, the smartphone is not yet IP certified. It means it is not water and dust resistant and the smartphone will get damaged in the prolonged exposure to water.         Display  On the display front, OnePlus 6 comes with the tall 6.28-inch Optic AMOLED display. The display contributes to 83.8% screen-to-body ratio, all thanks to the narrow bezels on the phone. Speaking of the bezels, the smartphone lacks bezels on the top and there is only a small notch to house the front camera, earpiece, and the sensors. The presence of the (nearly) all-screen display and a notch on the top gives the vibe of the  iPhone X . But it is not bad by any means, other smartphones like  Vivo V9 ,  Oppo F7 , etc. have also adopted a similar design with the cutouts in the display.  Performance  In terms of performance, the OnePlus 6 is nowhere less than the prevailing flagship smartphones in the market. It comes with the powerful  Snapdragon 845 chipset   with an overkilling 6GB RAM alongside. On the storage front, the handset boasts 64GB of onboard storage. However, the smartphone lacks an SD card slot. So users cannot expand the storage on the device.  Camera  Talking about the camera, the OnePlus 6 comes with a dual-camera setup on the rear panel. The camera duo comprises 16MP and 20MP sensors. Both the cameras boast a wide f/1.7 aperture lenses. So we can expect appealing images even when shooting during the low lights. And upfront, there is a 16MP selfie shooter, which comes with an  EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) .   Software & Battery  On the software front, the smartphone enjoys the latest Android Oreo (v8.1) out of the box with Oxygen OS on the top. Google has also promised the smartphone with regular software updates. The smartphone also comes with a 3300 mAh non-removable battery with the Dash Charging (Fast Charging) support.

And promising a set of capable cameras in its smartphone, Xiaomi has launched a new handset here in Nepal. Namely known as the  Xiaomi Redmi S2 , the major highlight on the newbie is the dual camera at the back and an AI-powered selfie shooter up front.  Also Read:  Xiaomi Mobiles Price in Nepal  We have seen in a multiple occasion Xiaomi using the Snapdragon 625 chipset in its smartphones. And Xiaomi did it one more time in the Redmi S2. Alongside the Snapdragon 625 chipset, there is 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. We have already seen the Snapdragon 625 chipset in the smartphones like  Redmi Note 4 ,  MI A1 ,  Redmi 5 Plus , etc. and the smartphones have performed with a remarkable fluidity. So we can expect a similar performance from the Redmi S2.         In terms of display, the Xiaomi Redmi S2 comes with the tall 5.99-inch display. The display comes with 18:9 aspect ratio with narrow bezels on the top and on the bottom. With the screen-to-body ratio of 74.5%, the display obviously looks alluring. However, the display on the device only features and HD+ resolution contributing to a pixel density of merely 269 PPI.  The camera is the major highlight on the phone. The device carries a  dual camera setup  at the back comprising 12MP and 5MP cameras. The camera pair at the back is aligned vertically with an LED flash in between just like the  iPhone X  and the  Vivo V9 . With the dual cameras at an action, the smartphone can take amazing portrait shots with blurred backgrounds. Xiaomi has also talked about the inclusion of  EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization)  on the rear camera because of which the images/videos taken from the phone are less affected by shakes and vibrations while capturing the images and shooting videos.   And talking about the selfie camera, the Xiaomi Redmi S2 possesses a 16MP selfie shooter up front. A 16MP sensor already sounds amazing, but what is even more interesting is that the presence of a large pixel size (2.0µm) in the sensor. So we can expect a stellar performance of the phone in the camera department.  On the software side, the S2 comes with the Android Oreo out of the box. And there is 3080mAh battery to fuel the processes inside the phone. This non-removable battery also supports fast charging of 10 watts (5V/2A).

This is an online exclusive phone and the interested ones can make a purchase from Daraz. Buyers can also get Rs. 1,000 off in the checkout by using the code “ darazgbt ”.   Buy Xiaomi Redmi S2   The smartphone sounds really amazing in terms of camera but it does not quite meet the standards of the smartphones at the similar price bracket. The absence of the Full-HD display or in other words, the presence of the mere HD+ display is a huge letdown.  So if you are thinking to own this smartphone, it would be better if you consider thinking it twice. You can get better alternatives at the similar price segment. And the options do not require seeking far away. Xiaomi already has better smartphones in its lineup. At just Rs. 24, 499, you can get the Xiaomi MI A1. This smartphone comes with a Full HD display and dual cameras at the back capable of capturing images with 2x Optical Zoom. Furthermore, the MI A1 is an Android One smartphone and Google has promised to provide regular software updates up to the  Android P  version.   Similarly, if you can add Rs. 3,000 more, you can get the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI, which is the  best smartphone in Nepal under Rs. 30,000 .

However, Nepal was yet to experience the likes of it. But now, the wait is finally over and Huawei has launched the P20 in Nepal.  As we are aware, the feature highlight of the device is the cameras. The Huawei P20 features the Leica’s Dual cameras that pack plenty of features like the temperature sensor, pixel-level color optimization, etc. The dual cameras at the back feature a 12MP f/1.8 RGB+ 20 MP f/1.6 monochrome camera setup. The cameras also come with AI image stabilization that helps you get perfect blur-free pictures effortlessly, as claimed by Huawei.  Similarly, like its competitor, the  Samsung Galaxy S9 , this one too shows off the super slow motion video option recorded at 960 frames per second in HD resolution. However, since it’s just HD, like the S9, there may be concerns regarding loss of quality. But, we cannot be certain about that right now so we will have to give it a test.         Similarly, with the f/1.6 and f/1.8 apertures, the low light performance is also expected to be good.

And the reason why we all should be excited about this is that this the first 12nm processor meant solely for mid-range devices.  MediaTek has been recently working to improve its SoCs and the new Helio P22 chipset showcases exactly that. This product follows the previous launch of the Helio P60 which has been received quite well.  The Helio P22 has opened a whole new horizon for mid-range smartphones as it offers quite a lot of features. The SoC offers AI-accelerated features, supports HD display of up to 20:9 aspect ratio, dual cameras, and a high-speed connectivity, all for an affordable price.        MediaTek has claimed that this move will now help them to expand in the “new premium” market. We hear a lot about cheap phones getting better day-by-day and the P22 is now in works for that.  With the 12nm technology in place, we can expect the Helio P22 to provide a smooth performance all while giving priority to the power saving as well. The chipset will have the octa-core Cortex A53 processors with up to 2.0 GHz of clock speed for the high performance.  In terms of camera, the new MediaTek Helio P22 supports dual 13+8 megapixel cameras with a video capture of up to 30 frames per second. According to MediaTek, the P22 “is equipped to minimize grain, noise, aliasing, chromatic aberration and more; enabling crisp and clear images under varying lighting conditions.”  The MediaTek Helio P22 also supports Bluetooth 5.0 which we don’t usually see in a mid-range smartphone. Also, there is an ac WiFi band for better internet connections.  The MediaTek Helio P22 is already in production right now, and according to the manufacturers, the product will be available on various smartphones by the end of Q2 2018.  This new product from MediaTek is commendable, and I am now hoping the company will now step into the flagship zone and launch a new product as a successor to the Helio X30.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mediatek-helio-p22-launched.png']

['Oppo F7 Review: The Surprisingly Powerful Selfie Expert'],['Reviews'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['May 21, 2018']",2018-05-21 12:47:27+00:00,"['As soon as we hear Oppo, the first thing that comes to our mind is a selfie. And while Oppo stays true to its tradition of being one of the leading brands of the selfie phones, it also quickly refashions to the new design trends. At a time when the Notch design and bezel-less displays are in the trend, Oppo has released its new flagship, the  Oppo F7 . Being a selfie camera it does have a great 25MP camera but apart from that what else does it have in stores? Let’s find out in this review.  Oppo F7 Specifications:   OS: Android Oreo 8.1  Dimension: 156×75.3×7.8mm  Display: 6.23” IPS LCD 1080×2280 pixels with 19:9 aspect ratio with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection  RAM: 4/6GB  ROM: 64/128 GB extendable up to 256 GB (dedicated microSD card slot)  Selfie camera: 25 MP f/2.0  Rear camera: Dual 16MP f/1.8 with phase detection auto-focus,  Chipset: Mediatek Helio P60  CPU: Octa-core (4×2.0 GHz Cortex-A73 + 4X2.0 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU: Mali-G72 MP3  Battery: 3,400 mAh non-removable Li-Ion battery (5V/2A charging)  Bluetooth: 4.2, A2DP LE  Sensors: Fingerprint (rear-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, Compass  WLAN: WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, WiFi direct, hotspot  Price: Rs. 36,590 (4GB/64GB) | Rs 46,590 (6GB/128GB)   Design and Build  Let’s start with the design. The Oppo F7 has a gorgeous and elegant design. The front of the phone looks similar to iPhone X ( Read review ) except that Oppo F7 is larger in dimension than iPhone X. The back of the phone is plastic and is prone to get fingerprints easily. It often slipped from my hand and I had to clean the back frequently when not applying a case. Now the plastic back might be a letdown but the feel and finishing of the device make it look like glass so I assure it makes up to it.         What I like is that the phone feels more premium than any other Oppo phones and feels great in hand. The Vivo V9 ( Read review ) which has similar weight and thickness but the F7 yet feels much lighter and slimmer in hand.   The Oppo F7 has a dimension 156 x 75.3 x 7.8 mm and weighs about 158g. The standby volume keys are on the left side while power button along with dedicated trays for dual SIM and microSD slot on the right. On the bottom there is a micro USB, speaker, microphone and 3.5mm Headphone jack. The 16MP rear camera is placed at the back with the fingerprint sensor.   A tiny notch on the top of the screen houses a 25 MP Selfie camera, earpiece and sensor. However, it lacks a notification light. This isn’t a big problem but few people do love it. The speaker is quite loud & sharp.   Display  The IPS LCD display has a full HD Plus resolution with an unusual 19:9 aspect ratio. The display is sharp and clear with an excellent contrast ratio. However, it is not as bright as I expected, so you need to put the brightness level at 100% when you are outdoors on a bright sunny day.   The display is a treat to watch with the minimalistic bezel and the Full View display. It also has ‘night mode’ which helps to filter out blue light to protect from visual fatigue. With that, there is ‘Night shield’ in the display settings that can be scheduled. Also, it is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 right out the box.   Oppo F7 has on-screen navigation buttons creating a slim bezel at the bottom. The 6.23 display is difficult to use with a single hand. But there are features like one-handed mode & assistive ball to make it easier to use with one hand. There are other many helpful features that you can access the built-in app ‘Tips’.  Performance\xa0 \xa0  Oppo F7 houses the MediaTek Helio P60 chipset with 4GB RAM. Now there’s a belief among people that Qualcomm is better than MediaTek but that is not the case anymore and the Oppo F7 proves this.  The phone works great during normal usage of internet surfing, listening music & using social media. Even while multitasking apps like Snapchat, YouTube, and high-end games, the phone didn’t slow down or lagged. Not even once. I also tried multitasking high-end games like PUBG Mobile, Shadowgun Legend and other games like Piano tiles also Facebook. However, it did not crash and switching between the apps was quite smooth too.  The F7 has a built-in ‘Game Acceleration’ which automatically accelerates the performance of the phone when you open a game. Playing games was a great pleasure. The full display with and great performance made the experience very enjoyable. The temperature didn’t rose so much while playing game low-end games. But it did heat up a little after 15-20 minutes of switching between high-end games. So I would say the performance of F7 is amazing.  Software  Talking about the software department, the phone boasts on Android 8.1.0 Oreo. It does have a clunky UI but a smooth interface and I love the animation. There are many pre-installed apps like WPS office, iReader which can be uninstalled if unwanted. It has a built-in step counter as well which keeps track of our health. Theme store that allows you to download a variety of themes and wallpapers. The phone manager has features like cleaning storage, privacy, virus scan, and so on. The noticeable change is that the control panel is now accessed by swiping it down from the top. It also has many features including split screen, flashlight, and one-handed mode and so on.      Oppo F7 | User Interface    1  of 7                                                                                        Camera  Moving on to the main highlight of the F7, the 25 MP AI enabled selfie camera.\xa0Oppo has claimed that this version of beautifying tool is better, and we put that to the test with a\xa0mole testing. Certainly, this time, the smartphone passes that test as you can see from this image sample.      Normal Vs Beauty Mode    1  of 2               Normal Mode         Beauty Mode (AI)                  However, sometimes it tends to turn you into a wax doll with too much of beauty mode in place. But even though I am not a selfie queen, taking selfie was fun. The selfies are good even in low lightings. The pictures taken are vibrant, clear and have great saturation. The camera has many features like HDR, Super vivid mode and so on.      Oppo F7 Selfie Samples    1  of 3                                                Now, the 16 MP rear camera is no less amazing. The rear camera is a single camera at the back of 16MP with a wider f 1.8 aperture. I did miss dual cameras on the back. Well, yeah, I am not that into taking portrait mode pictures, but still, the secondary lens could have been utilized for a monochrome lens at least. I can say that the single camera doesn’t offer a great portrait shot compared to the one from dual cameras. You can see this comparison shot between the Vivo V9 and Huawei Nova 3e.   Nonetheless, the normal pictures taken under well-lit conditions are crisp, sharp, vibrant and clear. With the super vivid mode and HDR mode, I clearly got some amazing pictures. The Super vivid mode brings out every color so beautifully. Though the camera does have a hard time in differentiating scenes and objects.      Oppo F7 | Back Camera Samples    1  of 7                                                                                        With a bright aperture, I thought the low light images is going to be stellar. However, with the lack of stabilization, most of the lowlight shots were blurry, noisy and lacked detail.  An additional feature is ‘Expert mode’ which allows you to adjust WB, ISO, shutter speed and focus as per your choice. It’s simple and easy to use. Here are some pictures taken in different ISO, aperture and exposure time.   Overall, the cameras both front and back are great for pictures. However, I can’t say the same about the video. It lacks any kind of stabilization, so the videos come out shaky with subpar dynamic range and contrast.  Fingerprint and Security  The fingerprint and face unlock of Oppo F7 in a lightning-quick span.\xa0 It takes less than a second to unlock and I love that about it.   The AI recognition Technology uses 128 recognition points to identify the face. It also has PIN passcode but doesn’t have character or pattern password.  Battery  The 3400mAh battery on the Oppo F7 literally lasts all day even while playing games occasionally. The energy efficient 12nm Helio P60 processor is at play once again.  However, it took me around 2.5 hours to fully charge from 0 to 100%. This is due to the fact that which it lacks any kind of fast charging support.  In our review of the Oppo F5 last year, we had suggested Oppo to include the VOOC technology on its smartphone, but that’s not the case this time as well. Huawei recently launched the Nova 3e that has fast charging enabled, so it’s high time Oppo followed the bandwagon as well.  Conclusion   The Oppo F7 might not have a great rear camera setup or the state of the art software. However, the device will never give up on you with the octa-core p60 processor at helm. And if you are more into selfies, let’s just say the F7 is the best smartphone for you.  It also has a long-lasting battery and a beautiful design. So, would I recommend this to someone? Well, definitely. Barring a couple of cons this device has, the features it offers, the selfie camera and that performance, all makeup to the Oppo F7 being a powerful midrange device.     Pros  Cons    Good Display  Plastic Build    Good Battery & Performance  Subpar Lowlight photography    Good Cameras (Front & Back)  No Dual Rear Camera']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Oppo-F7-review.jpg']
['Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI launched in Nepal with dual rear cameras'],"['Daraz online Shopping', 'Xiaomi']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['May 20, 2018']",2018-05-20 10:25:21+00:00,"['The Redmi Note series has been one of the most loved series from Xiaomi. It is also the lineup responsible for breaking a few of the smartphone  sales records . Recently, Xiaomi, on an event in India, announced the arrival of Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro. The Redmi Note 5 is also known as the  Redmi 5 Plus  which was launched a few months back in Nepal. The Redmi Note 5 AI is the company’s midrange flagship, which is a slight upgrade to the Redmi Note 5 Pro.\xa0 It is one of the most awaited smartphones amongst the tech enthusiasts and is all set to compete against the existing popular midrange phones like  Huawei Nova 2i ,  Vivo V9 , and  Oppo F7 .  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Overview  The Redmi Note 5 AI comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 that employs eight Kryo 260 cores at 4*1.8GHz and 4*1.6GHz. This, again, according to Xiaomi has 50% more performance, 40% more power efficient, and also delivers a sustained performance. The graphics department is handled by Adreno 509 GPU. It also comes with up to 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM which is the fastest RAM available on the market.         The display is a familiar 5.99″ 18:9 FHD+ display with  minimum bezels . The back is also covered by a tapered back and a vertically aligned  dual back cameras . The dual cameras Xiaomi employed is a 5MP Samsung sensor paired with a 12MP Sony IMX 486 sensor.  The front is equipped with the 13MP, f/2.0 camera capable of taking portrait selfies. The front also has a 4500k color temperature LED selfie light as well. The camera sample demos that Xiaomi showed in their presentation were pretty awesome. They weren’t shy at all, especially comparing the front camera with the likes of  iPhone X  and  Google Pixel 2 . Xiaomi claims the camera is AI based, which is one of the main reasons why their new camera is so good.  Coming back to that Kryo based processor, it is hands down one of the fastest processors in this price segment. Xiaomi quoted an Antutu score of a staggering 109,692. This makes it one of the best price to performance phones out there. The processor also delivers a pretty good battery life thanks to the  14nm manufacturing process .  The smartphone also features the same tapered back cover as the  Redmi Note 5 . There are a few other features like Beautify 4.0 which is an intelligent software that improves your selfie. And finally, the face unlock feature, which will arrive through an OTA in March.\xa0 \xa0  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Specifications   Display:\xa0 5.99-inch IPS FHD+ display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Protection  CPU:  1.8 GHz Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 636  GPU:\xa0 Adreno 509 GPU  OS: \xa0Android Oreo 8.0 with MIUI 9.0 on the top  RAM:  4GB  Storage:  64GB,\xa0up to 128GB expandable storage (uses SIM 2)  Rear Camera: \xa0 5MP + 12MP, LED flash  Front Camera: \xa013MP with f/2.0 with LED flash  Sensors : Accelerometer, proximity, gyro, IR blaster, Fingerprint  SIM: \xa0Dual hybrid SIM with 4G VOLTE  Battery:  4,000mAh  Latest Price :  Rs. 23,499 (3/32GB) | Rs. 27,499 (4/64GB) [Last updated on December 6, 2018]   Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Vs Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI  Let me clear your doubts first, Redmi Note 5 Pro is the Indian variant and the Redmi Note 5 AI is the Chinese Variant. Most of the specs on both the variants are same. However, one can notice a difference in the camera section.  The Indian Variant or the Redmi Note 5 Pro comes with a 20MP front camera that enjoys a f/2.2 aperture and a pixel size of 1µm. The Chinese variant, on the other hand, is low on the megapixel count as compared to the Indian variant. The Redmi Note 5 AI is gifted with a 13MP camera, f/2.0 aperture, and a pixel size of 1.12µm. So when looked at the numbers, the Redmi Note 5 Pro may seem better of the two. However, with f/2.0 aperture, the Note 5 AI performs better at low lights. Similarly, because of the larger pixel size, the AI variant carries sharper details of the subject in the images.  Also Read:  Understanding smartphone camera terms  Similarly, at the back, both the variants are provided with a dual camera setup containing 12MP and 5MP cameras. The AI variant possesses 12 MP primary camera with f/1.9 aperture and a pixel size of 1.4µm whereas the Note 5 Pro 12MP camera possesses a slightly narrow aperture (f/2.2) and slightly smaller pixels (1.25µm). So the primary camera on the Note 5 AI captures sharp details with a remarkable performance even in a dark environment.  Furthermore, the 5MP secondary camera also comes with richer attributes in the Chinese variant (f/2.0 aperture, 1.25µm pixel size) over the Indian variant (f/2.0, 1.12µm). So the secondary camera on the Note 5 AI is reasonably a better performer and capable of gathering the depth information with high accuracy as compared to the Redmi Note 5 pro.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI Price in Nepal  Latest Price :  Rs. 23,499 (3/32GB) | Rs. 27,499 (4/64GB) [Last updated on December 6, 2018]  Since the day of the global launch of the smartphone, a number of people in Nepal were quite interested in the product. And there a number of messages sent on our  Facebook  and  Instagram \xa0sent by our followers asking about the launch of the phone. There were already a lot of rumors flying around in the market regarding its launch in Nepal. And now, Vatsal Impex finally launched the smartphone in Nepal.\xa0If you are interested to own the device, you can simply pre-book it from their\xa0 official website of the Xiaomi Nepal . You can get the device directly from  Daraz  as well.  Vatsal Impex has priced the 4GB version of the Redmi Note 5 AI at  Rs. 28,499 . We have seen a lot of times, Vatsal Impex tagging the Xiaomi products with an exorbitant price tag. And that attitude has changed when Teletalk was appointed as another official distributor and when it started selling Xiaomi phones at relatively cheaper prices.  Also Read:\xa0 Who should be the sole distributor of Xiaomi products in Nepal?  The smartphone was launched in China at the price of 1,399 Yuan ($220) which is nearly equivalent to NPR 24,000. So this time too, the smartphone is slightly overpriced. Since Teletalk is yet to launch the smartphone, there are also chances that the smartphone could be available at a price lower than the price set by Vatsal. Nonetheless, the smartphone still would be a good buy at its current price. Even at this price, the smartphone is expected to supersede all the  popular mid-range smartphones in Nepal . At this price, the smartphone will go head to head against the likes of  Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo ,  Vivo V9 Youth ,  Oppo F5 Youth ,  Huawei Nova 2i ,  Nokia 6 2018 , etc.  So what are your thoughts regarding the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 AI?

['Acer Aspire V Nitro Review: The new bang for your buck'],['Reviews'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['May 20, 2018']",2018-05-20 08:52:15+00:00,"['It’s the general nature of humans to pay as little as possible for the absolute maximum.\xa0 The same process can be tiresome and even boring at times. But we will strive to deliver the absolute best advice to all our buyers, and here we are, with the Acer Aspire V Nitro, a steal for the absolute less.  The Acer Aspire V Nitro features the same i7 processor, 10 series GPU, ample RAM & storage, a FHD display that caps out at 60hhz and adequate thermals just like any other gaming laptop. What it does better is by pricing itself comparatively lower than any other laptops with similar specifications.         Acer Aspire V Nitro Specs   Display : 15.6″ Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution\xa0ComfyView\xa0IPS technology  Processor : Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8GHz (Turbo up to 3.8GHz)  Graphics Card : NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB GDDR5  RAM : 16GB DDR4 2400MHz  HDD : 1TB  Dimensions : 15.39″ x 10.47″ x 0.98″  Weight : 2.6kgs  Battery : 70Whr (load 1h/idle 4h)  Price : Rs 1,35,000   Buy Here    Build  The laptop weights 2.6Kgs and has a thickness of 0.98mm which sounds acceptable for a gaming laptop. It also feels sturdy with plastic on top and bottom with metal palm rest. The top has\xa0this unusual lining texture at the top which is a real dust magnet. The bottom has a rubberish plastic feel to it.  Our review unit had the Black Edition painted on top of the aluminum brushed palm rest. It did work as most parts of the laptop was black, but I would have loved to see a non-red backlit keyboard as well. The laptop was prone to a few creeks with a decent amount of screen and chassis flex.  Performance  Unsurprisingly, day to day tasks are a breeze thanks to the Core i7 7700HQ Quad Core processor and 16GB of DDR4 RAM at 2400Mhz. There were no signs of bottlenecking, and everything worked as expected. The lack of SSD does hinder the performance and app loading times a bit, but we also tried it with an SSD and everything was as smooth as it can be.  Gaming Performance  The gaming performance of this laptop is as good as any other laptop with a full-fledged mobile GTX 1060 GPU. That by no means is a bad thing, and will easily challenge the likes of last year’s GTX 980M. Most games run at well over 60 frames per second with settings turned up high at native Full HD resolution. You can check the data from our tests below and judge yourself.   Acer Aspire V Nitro  Thermals  As for the thermals, this laptop did pretty okay. 30 minutes into any game and temperatures will rise to about 50 degrees without much fuss. The heat was limited to the top part of the keyboard so, you might not notice it so much. The fans are really loud so headphones are recommended.  Talking about throttling, yes games throttle a bit more as compared to other laptops. One hour into PUBG, I saw my fps drop from 60 to 50fps. By the end of the second hour, the fps dropped well below 45fps. Finally, by the time I was in my third hour, the game was basically unplayable at 30-45fps.  Display  The laptop has a 15.6” display with a\xa0resolution of 1920 by 1080 and a maximum refresh rate of 60 Hertz. It covers about 85% of sRGB and 56% of Adobe RGB color spectrum. In case you want a more color accurate display, get the 4k variant with 98% of the sRGB color coverage and 62% of Adobe RGB. Our 1080p version was a bit on the cooler side, which was nice.  Brightness hovered at around 300nits for the 1080p and 250nits for the 4k variant. In comparison, the display on the V Nitro was comparatively better than others in the similar price category. Colors were more vibrant and display itself was on the cooler side, which did help with the viewing pleasures.  Storage  On the storage front, there’s 1TB mechanical hard drive. It’s basically a 5400rpm hard disk with speeds of around 100mbps (upload) and 100mbps (download). You can also opt for an SSD, which is a must if you want a performance boost.\xa0A 256GB NVMe SSDs usually cost around 10k and are well worth the price.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The keyboard on this laptop is average at best. It has a messy key layout, which I got used to with time. What I could not stand was the short key travel and a mushy feeling at the end. I prefer a more tactile clicky feel and a healthy amount of feedback.   The laptop also has a red backlit which isn’t an actual problem, but I was expecting a different color since it’s a black edition laptop. The trackpad, on the other hand, is acceptable, with Windows precision tracking mechanism. It’s plastic, but the tracking seems decent. The fingerprint resides on the trackpad itself which is also fast and secure.  Connectivity &\xa0Battery Life  Connectivity wise, it uses Qualcomm’s dual-band ac wifi and Bluetooth 4.2. I did not face any connectivity issues. Ports selection was a bit different with the power plug residing on the right, followed by the Ethernet, HDMI USB 3.0, USB C and another USB 3.0. On the left, you get two USB 3.0, a mic and audio port and an SD card reader.  The onboard speakers are decently loud and clear. It does lack a bit of bass. I would still recommend headphone for gaming because of the loud fans. As for the unplugged life, the 70Whr battery pushes around 4-5 hours of normal usage on a single charge. And if you plan to game on battery, don’t expect anything over an hour.  Conclusion  So for Rs. 1,35,000 you get a Quadcore i7 7700HQ processor, 16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, a full-fledged 6GB GTX 1060, and a nice display panel. That makes it a solid buy, just don’t forget to slap an SSD. I also recommend you do not drop the laptop, even at the lowest height. The laptop has a plastic outer shell and feels a bit fragile.      Pros   Display    Price to performance ratio    Connectivity     Cons   Keyboard    Thermals    Build     Alternatives  You can opt for the  Dell 7577  which is a good option with similar specs, but a better build. It, however, sacrifices on a performance with a MAX Q 1060 GPU rather than a full-fledged 1060. There is also Acer’s own  Helios 300 , which could be a worthy alternative. It shares almost exactly the same specs, except for the body itself.  If your budget allows, you can also give the   Acer Predator 15  a try, which is my personal favorite. It offers immensely better cooling, better build and in general a better package, but you will have to shell out about 30k more, which I guess most people won’t even consider.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Acer-Aspire-V-Nitro-Review.jpg']

However, there are some EBook reader apps, which have earned goodwill to satisfy the voracious bookworms to feel the magic of words. Here is the list of such apps, which are renowned to provide comfort to the eyes and have been successful to lure the users with its versatility, user interface, and features.  Also Read:  Best Health and Fitness apps for healthy lifestyle  Moon+ Reader         This is probably the best EBook reader app available till date to open and read the offline ebook files. The app is pretty versatile because of its dexterity to unveil the content of a wide range of ebook file extensions. The user interface of the app is stupendous. The settings and adjustment buttons are placed meticulously because of which users rarely find difficulties while reading.  An ebook loads in a portrait mode and fits well within the screen when opened in this app. However, reading on the portrait mode is not mandatory in the Moon+ Reader. One can shift the display to landscape mode whenever convenient or can even let that be auto adjusted. With the orientation set to auto mode, the app fetches the information from the sensors about the alignment of the device and adjusts the orientation of the ebook accordingly. Likewise, there are other modes to adjust the visual setting to bring the display to the users’ likings. That includes tweaking of the font, font size, text and background color, font styles and different sorts of spacing and margins. In addition, there is a mode to set fascinating animations during the page flips.  Moon+ Reader also includes the auto-scrolling feature to evade the irritating task of flipping and scrolling the pages every now and then. This feature is pretty handy since the scrolling speed can be set according to the user’s reading pace. Encounter to the unfamiliar words is a not new thing while reading books. And such circumstances turn out to be speed breakers at times. To avoid such circumstances while reading, the app collaborates with the dictionary and translating app on the phone and helps the users to find the meaning of such unacquainted words. Likewise, highlighting the quotes and bookmarking the pages in the book is also hassle-free in this app.  The customizations and user-friendliness do not end here. There are some nifty features for the eye care too. In order to prevent the eyes from the strain of bright light in the dark, it has an option to switch the book background to black. The app also warns to discontinue the reading if the eyes linger in the ebook for more than the preset time. Furthermore, the app is provided with blue light filtering option taking account of the users’ eyes protection. And the good part is that the users can set the opacity of pages in the blue light filter option according to their preferences. Despite being loaded with loads of such customizable options and user-friendly gestures, Moon+ Reader is light in weight with a mere size of 10MB.  The Moon+ Reader app is not available for the iOS platform. So the iPhone users can use Aldiko reader app, which is another great ebook reader app. However, the Aldiko reader is slightly behind the Moon+ Reader app in terms of features and customizations.  Amazon Kindle   Reading the offline files is swift and easy with Moon+ Reader. But consequences will be cumbersome if the offline ebook files are not available for certain books. And Amazon Kindle is the app, which comes as a rescue during such scenarios. Amazon has a huge library of books, which can be accessed after the creating and logging in to Amazon profile in this app.  Picking up and getting started with the books is tranquil in the Amazon Kindle app too. However, all the books in the store are not free and demand certain price before downloading them. And the payment should be made only through the internationally accepted debit or credit cards. These procedures are frustrating for those who do not have access to such cards. But things get easier after the downloads.  Alike the Moon+ Reader, this app also has the option to set the visual preferences like display brightness, text size, color, font, spaces, margins, and alignments. Searching text, highlighting quotes, copying them and sharing them among the friends is also hassle-free indifferent to the Moon+ Reader. However, the major difference between the two is the way to acquaint the unfamiliar words in the books. Unlike the Moon+ Reader, Amazon Kindle obliges the users to download a discrete dictionary, which resides as the app data and divulges the meaning of the words without leaving its user interface. To help the users tussle against the challenging words, the app also has a built-in Word Wise mode, which hints the users about the possible meaning of such words. This feature is seamlessly fascinating since the meaning floats just above the words and users barely have to waste time on seeking the meanings.  Along with the comforting user interface, the app is also astoundingly interactive. Readers can share the progress while reading books and can even recommend the books to the friends. After reading a book, users can review and rate it, which could guide other readers to purchase or read them.  We Read   Finding offline ebook files for the Nepali books is barely possible. And despite having a huge store, Amazon too seems useless for that matter. We Read is a possible solution to such crisis. Developed by Kathalaya, We Read is an app conceived by and conceived for the Nepali book lovers.  The bookstore of the app contains Nepali and English fiction and non-fiction books. The app has managed to classify books into a wide range of categories, which have eased the users to identify the book genres before picking them. Free books can be readily downloaded. However, some books demand certain price, which could be paid through the online payment gateways like eSewa and PayPal. Despite having a limited number of books in the store, the preferences within the app does not seem deficient. The app has not failed to include preference buttons to adjust the display brightness, font face, text size, margins, spacing, etc.  The app lacks the option to illuminate the meaning of the challenging words. Some books in the We Read store even lack the necessary description. Also, reviewing and rating the read books is unbelievably cumbersome in the We Read. But despite all the glitches and absence of features, the step put forward by Kathalaya to bridge the Nepali authors and Nepali book lovers are absolutely commendable. The app would be better with the abnormalities fixed and with the user-friendly and interactive features added to it. Hope the app comes in a better shape in the coming days and the endeavor of Kathalaya team will be more fruitful for the Nepali authors and readers.  These are the best ebook reader apps for the smartphones and if you love books, you must consider installing these apps on your phone. So, install these apps on your smartphone, take your cellphone out and dive into the magic of words anytime and anywhere. Happy Reading!!!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Best-ebook-reader-apps.png']
['Things to consider while choosing a smartphone SoC'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['May 17, 2018']",2018-05-17 09:00:29+00:00,"['Latest smartphones have surpassed its predecessors. Companies now invest more in the initial research and development (R&D) of a product with respect to consumer requirements. All smartphones are built in a similar fashion, but which system architecture meets your demands? The specifications include features as Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 octa-core 1.8 GHz 14nm FinFET or Mediatek Helio X30 Cortex-A73 deca-core with Tri-Cluster CPU architecture. What do they mean? Here is a little insight to the technical Jargons explaining about the things to consider while choosing a smartphone SoC in the simplest words possible.  Chip manufacturers:  Lately, smartphone processors are built in a single system-on-a-chip (SoC) where several components are embedded in a single chip. The majority of smartphones use the CPU architecture designed by the ARM. At the moment, there are four major Android smartphone SoC manufacturers: Qualcomm’s  Snapdragon  editions, Samsung’s  Exynos  chips,  MediaTek  with its MT and Helio processors,  Apple’s A-series  and Huawei’s  Kirin  chips, each of these designs a variety of chips for low-range, mid-range and high-end smartphones.  ARM architecture:  Almost all the mobile processors in 2018 boast the  ARMv8-A  (64 bit) architecture for high performance in mobile computing. Its 64-bit core processor also focuses on power efficiency while maintaining its compatibility with the 32-bit software. Further, the ARMv8 cortex-A series label their processors as the  A7X series  which deliver very high performance in consumer products (Cortex-A76, Cortex-A75, Cortex-A73, and Cortex-A72),  A5X series  (Cortex-A57, Cortex-A55 and Cortex-A53) for balanced performance and efficiency, and finally, the  A3X series  (Cortex-A35 and Cortex-A32) used for lowest power consumption.         Nearly all mobile manufacturing companies (like Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung, MediaTek, Huawei and so on) have the architectural license to build their CPU architecture based on ARM, unlike some smartphones such as Lenovo and Xolo, which are based on  Intel’s x64 processors .  Apart from the A series architecture, there are also  custom cores . As the name suggests, it is a CPU core design made by ARM architectural licensees. But most of the architectural licensees also hold a core license, which means they can use the ARM core designs as well as build their own core. For example, Qualcomm’s first generation processors all use ARM Cortex-A whereas the second generation uses both the Cortex-A and its own designs (Snapdragon’s  630 , 810, 650 and 652 all use cortex-A designs, however, the  Snapdragon 855 ,  845 ,  835 , 821, 820 use its own  Kyro  core). Likewise, Apple uses their own  Swift   core  which was their first custom core used in iPhone 5 and Samsung’s custom core named  Mongoose , which was released with their latest Exynos processors.  Model Number:  The objective of the mobile companies is to make a better product with each release and are classified according to their editions, whether you want high-end flagship smartphones or a mid-range or cheaper budget smartphones. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon series was introduced in 2013 with Snapdragon 800 accompanied by 200, 400 and 600 series.       Release Date:  Snapdragon 200s  Snapdragon 400s  Snapdragon 600s  Snapdragon 700s  Snapdragon 800s    2013  \xa0  410  600  \xa0  800, 805    2014  208, 210  \xa0  602A, 610, 615  \xa0  801, 808, 810    2015  212  412, 415, 430  616, 617, 652, 650  \xa0  820    2016  \xa0  425, 430, 435  625, 626, 653  \xa0  821, 835    2017  205  \xa0427, 450  630, 636, 660  \xa0  845    2018  \xa0  429, 439  632, 670, 675  710  855      Clock speed\xa0  A processor’s clock speed is the rate at which it can execute a given set of instruction and is measured in terms of Hertz (GHz or MHz). Higher the rate, faster it processes the information. Faster clock speeds mean more responsive while running a linear application (playing games or using a web browser).  For a heavy gamer higher clock speed is a boon but also, greater the processing speed the more heat it dissipates and consumes more battery.  This is the tradeoff between performance (clock speed) and power consumption.  Core count:  The number of cores can be related to having many hands to complete a given task. If you have eight hands (or having eight cores), you can easily wash your clothes by using all of your hands but there’s a limitation i.e. the speed. Since all hands don’t work at the same speed, the work may be done by using only four hands operating at a greater speed (the other four hands unused). In a similar fashion, you can wash your clothes effectively by using four large hands at normal speed as it would be drudgery for smaller hands to complete the same amount of task.  So having a greater number of cores (hands) is not always a better option.  The limitation of a single core processor is its clock speed, heat dissipation, and accuracy. Extra cores overcome this limitation with clock speeds by effectively multiplying the amount of data handled by the CPU since multi-core CPU’s are able to take a larger batch of data than their single core counterparts and appear faster.  Qualcomm Snapdragon 439, Snapdragon 632, and the Samsung Exynos 9610 processors are based on 8 core processors arranged in ARM’s  big.Little setup  (power management technology). The 8 cores are arranged in two clusters. One cluster has four large powerful cores with high processing ability and the other cluster has four small cores which have lower clock speed but more efficiency.   The big.LITTLE software can save 75% of CPU energy in low to moderate performance scenarios and can increase performance by 40% in complex calculations. Similarly, a 10-core MediaTek Helio X30 embraces the Tri-Cluster setup, which consists of two heavy-duty cores clocked at higher speed along with a medium performance quad-core clocked at a lower speed, and further, a power efficient quad-core running at minimum speed.\xa0  MediaTek states that this type of design offers 30 percent improvement in power consumption compared to the 2-cluster setup.  The design makes use of heterogeneous processing, meaning that tasks can be administered to any CPU core at any time.      \xa0  Qualcomm Snapdragon 855  Exynos 9820  HiSilicon Kirin 980  MediaTek Helio X30    CPU  1x Cortex-A76 @ 2.84GHz  3x Cortex A76\xa0@ 2.42GHz  4x Cortex A-55 @ 1.8GHz  2x Exynos M4  2x Cortex A75  4x Cortex A55  2x Cortex-A76 @ 2.6GHz  2x Cortex A76\xa0@ 1.92GHz  4x Cortex A-55 @ 1.8GHz  2x Cortex-A73 @ 2.6GHz  4x Cortex-A35 @ 1.9GHz  4x Cortex-A53 @ 2.2GHz     Processor architecture (nm technology):  Any chip, be it a processor, memory or a GPU is made by integrating a large number of transistors. A transistor is simply a switch for electronic signals and has two states (ON/OFF). Nanometer (nm) architecture is the size of a transistor. The smaller the size, the more transistors can be embedded into the processor chip which increases its computing volume. A 45nm, 32nm, 28nm, 14nm, 10nm, 8nm, and 7nm are basically the scaling of the transistor with new fabrication technology. A 7nm (nanometer) chip is a path for current to flow. Since machines can only take bits as information (bits are binary digit 0’s and 1’s equivalent to ON/OFF state), a 7nm chip is based on a similar fashion. Shorter the length of a chip, the faster the current (or information) can flow through it. Also, shorter chips consume less voltage to operate and therefore, use less power.  Also Read:  Understanding the nanometer technology: Why should you care?   Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855  is designed on a 7nm FinFET processor which can deliver up to 45% higher performance or 25% less power consumption than the 10nm chips.  Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):  GPU is a graphics engine which is capable of producing 3D environment on a 2D display (like playing PUBG Mobile & Asphalt 9 game on your display). Qualcomm’s Snapdragon \xa0GPU branded under the name Adreno offers its users a high-speed GPU in a portable android device with better graphics, improved power savings, and increased performance. Also, the ARM’s Mali GPU-based smartphone relies on a whole new architecture which is not common in most GPU’s. These enable complex 2D and 3D gaming in a wide range of today’s smartphones with better clock speed. One cannot simply compare between these GPU’s by the specifications until the device is tested to its operating limits.  Connectivity (3G, 4G LTE, 5G bands):  Smartphones come with several communications and connectivity facilities including 3G, 4G LTE, GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi which requires hardware support of modems and chips. In a similar way, 5G is also creating quite a buzz these days. If you want to send a text or have a chat, any GPRS signal would support it. However, tasks involving data transfer such as surfing the web, social networking, emailing require a stronger and more reliable connection. Latest smartphones include jargons such as 4G LTE band (LTE stands for Long Term Evolution) and 4G VoLTE (Voice Over LTE) band. These two are common terms and used interchangeably in mobile communication. 4G (or 4G LTE) is the fourth generation mobile communication technology which is around five to seven times faster than the existing 3G and 2G.  A 4G mobile network will get a quicker response to a request than the same device connected to a 3G mobile network. Qualcomm is the leading company in this respect, followed by Samsung and Huawei. MediaTek, however, is a step behind but are aiming for the new marketplace to compete.   Next time whenever you go through the specs of a smartphone you fancy, make sure you examine the above-mentioned attributes and choose a smartphone that includes hardware which can bolster your daily activities.

['OnePlus 6 Launched: The Newly Designed Classic OnePlus Smartphone'],"['Android', 'OnePlus']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['May 17, 2018']",2018-05-17 03:04:06+00:00,"['A few years ago, OnePlus was a new revolution in the smartphone industry. Providing industry’s top features in a budget price tag, the device started a whole new game in the smartphone world. Fast forward a few years, the company has launched the  OnePlus 6  – its the first device to cross the $500 price barrier for the baseline model. I know, I know, we are at a time when most flagship smartphones have started selling for $1000. But still, for a device that started the budget-flagship trend, OnePlus is now selling the 256 GB storage of the OnePlus 6 for $629. I will let you be the judge on whether this premium price is a big deal or not. But for now, let’s talk about this new flagship from OnePlus.  Also Read:\xa0 OnePlus Mobiles Price in Nepal  Design         The major upgrade to the OnePlus 6 over its predecessor, the OnePlus 5T, is in the design front. The newly launched device comes with a glass back and a notch up front. Very 2018! According to OnePlus, the company opted for glass because it provides a better signal, is more malleable and has a smooth touch.  The dual rear cameras are now vertical and have been placed in the middle with a fingerprint scanner sitting right below the lenses. Also, the Alert Slider has now been shifted to the right side. The bottom-firing speaker sits on the bottom alongside the charging port and a headphone jack.  Display   OnePlus has stayed traditional on the resolution of its new smartphone. The 6 has a full HD+ display (with 19:9 aspect ratio), which has helped the company cut cost. However, the major focus here is the notch on top. Although a lot of people hate the notch, it is what 2018 is giving us and I think it’s about time we get used to it. The OnePlus 6 has a smaller notch than the iPhone X’s. There is, however, an option to turn off the notch in the settings app.  Performance and Software   The theme of yesterday’s event was “The Speed You Need” which basically explains what OnePlus is doing with the 6. Once again, the company has focused on making the performance faster than ever. With the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 in place, the device now provides 30% more speed while using it.  There are three storage variants of the device, 64 GB, 128 GB and the company’s first 256 GB variant. The 64 GB version has 6 GB of RAM while the other two pack 8 GB of RAM.  On the software department, the OnePlus 6 runs on Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box with Oxygen OS on top. This software is near-stock and provides a lot of customization options which is certainly nice to have.  Camera   OnePlus has yet again made some changes to its camera setup. Unlike the  OnePlus 5T , the 16- and 20-megapixel rear-facing cameras are now focused on taking portrait photos as well. The 16-megapixel camera is now supported with OIS and EIS which will help with stabilization. This time around, OnePlus has upgraded the slow-motion feature on its device as the cameras can now capture 1080p slow-mo videos @240fps and 720p slow-mo videos @480fps. And the device is capable of shooting 4K videos @60fps as well. An update, later on, will also let users take portrait\xa0mode pictures from the front-facing camera.  Security and Other Features  Under the security options, OnePlus has provided users with Face Unlock and a fingerprint scanner. The Face Unlock looks to be just as fast as one on 5T, and the fingerprint scanner, which now has a lesser surface area is among the fastest in the market like its predecessors.  OnePlus has also made its smartphone splash and rain resistant which is certainly a necessary feature. They probably didn’t include an IP rating to cut cost.  Battery  Carl Pei didn’t really talk much about the battery of the OnePlus 6 at the launch event yesterday. He did, however, mention OnePlus’ beloved feature – Dash Charge. Like most of the OnePlus devices, the 6 can provide users with a days power in just half an hour of charge. The OnePlus 6 houses a 3,300mAh battery and I think we can expect a battery life that’s similar to the 5/5T.  Pricing and Availability  Well, like I mentioned before, the OnePlus 6 is the company’s first to cross the $500 price point. Here’s the full price list of the device:   6+64 GB:  $529  8+128 GB:  $579  8+256 GB:  $629   OnePlus 6 Price in Nepal\xa0\xa0      OnePlus 6\xa0(6GB + 64GB)  Rs. 65,500    OnePlus 6\xa0(8GB + 128GB)  Rs. 74,500    OnePlus 6\xa0(8GB + 128GB)  Rs. 84,500      OnePlus 6 Specifications:   Display : 6.28-inch Full HD+ Optic AMOLED; 19:9 aspect ratio, Corning Gorilla Glass 5  CPU : Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 845  OS : Android Oreo (v8.1) with OxygenOS on the top  RAM : 6/8 GB  GPU : Adreno 630  Storage : 64/128/256 GB  Rear Camera : 16MP (f/1.7, 1.22µm, EIS, OIS) + 20MP (f/1.7,\xa01.0µm), PDAF, dual-LED flash  Front Camera : 16 MP front-facing camera, f/2.0 aperture, EIS, Auto HDR  Sensors : Fingerprint, Accelerometer, Gyro, proximity, compass  SIM:\xa0 Dual SIM with 4G  Color Variant(s):\xa0 Mirror Black, Midnight Black, Silk White  Battery:  3,300 mAh with Dash Charge']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/oneplus-6-launched.png']

['Huawei Nova 2i Long Term Review: Still Worth it in 2018?'],['Huawei'],['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['May 15, 2018']",2018-05-15 16:55:54+00:00,"['It’s been 4 months that I have used the  Huawei Nova 2i  and I have pretty much experienced it fall out of hands a couple of times, changed around 4 tempered glasses, spilled mehendi all over the charging port and lots more.  During this long time of my usage, the device had become an integral part of my life and now it seems like I know this device inside out. Having said so, there are things about this device that I have grown to like very much and things that certainly need improvement. So, let’s go one by one talking about them.  Display and Design  As much as I like the design of the Nova 2i, I cannot help but appreciate how good the display is too. I am a Youtube addict and I have loved watching videos on the huge 5.9-inch screen. All these months of usage, I have spent 40% of my time watching videos and similar content on my Nova 2i and I certainly am as satisfied as I should be. There are so many devices that have launched in with a bezel-less 18:9 display, but this one has not lost its charm.         Similarly, it’s been months that I have used the Nova 2i, but it seems to be resistant to scratches at the rear portion. However, I have a bad habit of keeping stuffing everything in my bag, so I had a few scratches on the screen. Then, I used tempered glass which well, helped me prevent scratches.        1  of 3                                                \xa0  Having said that, I have dropped my phone a lot many times and even without any kind of screen protection, this device has endured my reckless usage properly. I only had to change 4 tempered glasses ;). So, yes the display has been durable till now. Similarly, I have been using the gold variant and the phone has slightly discolored at the edges.  Battery  Something that degrades on most of our smartphones over time is the battery. The Nova 2i features a 3,340 mAh battery, which, for my use lasted for a day when I first got the device. Even now, surprisingly, the battery lasts for the same amount of time having a similar pattern of usage.   On, continuous use, it lasts for around 7 hours, which well is in the scenario when I don’t turn on mobile data. With mobile data on, the battery life gets drained of its life easily. Similarly, after watching video content, the battery wears off and I have had instances of having to plug in my phone twice a day for around 2 and a half hours.  Camera  Something that I have done a lot is capture pictures and take a lot of videos from my Nova 2i. I have been satisfied with the camera performance of this device the moment I put my hands on it. The picture quality has not degraded at all and they look vibrant and punchy as they looked earlier.      Huawei nova 2i camera samples   1  of 9                                                                                                            The only complaint I have in the camera department is that it takes a tad bit of time to get launched. This has bothered me because I have missed many moments that I want to capture in many instances. So even though this one has had good performance in the camera department, I have suffered latency in opening the camera in the right moments. Other than that, I love the images from this device. Though I am still not satisfied with the portrait images as the edge detection is and was poor. Find out all the high res photo samples  here .   P.S the vlog was shot by Nova 2i  Performance  What is the problem with smartphones is that they slow down in performance over\xa0time. With the Nova 2i, I have faced instances like some applications take a bit longer time to open. But it’s the case where I have too many apps opened at once. When I say too many, it is a lot many. So, at such times, I have had the experience when the phone has frozen so I had to restart it to make it properly functional again. So, yes, the phone slows down sometimes when too many applications are opened at once. However, multitasking has not been a problem and still is good as it was earlier when I got this device.  I have also spilled Menehdi all over the charging port and I thought I would have to spend a lot of money fixing it, but surprisingly, the phone still works fine.  Similarly, the Nova 2i just got an Oreo update and there are a few subtle changes that have happened like the setting menu looks cleaner. Other than that there is nothing very significant I have noticed. But I do get timely security updates. Well, Huawei seems to have taken care of this department very well. I did get the update that enabled facial to unlock on my device and the phone does not seem to recognize me sometimes. When it does, I feel that it takes some time. The fingerprint sensor is as snappy as it was.   The call quality is still the same on this device as it was before. Connectivity wise, the device still holds up pretty well. The sound quality has been good as well.  The gaming performance was average before and it is the same even now, so I would say it has not degraded. I don’t choose to play intense games as there are few lags in high settings. Otherwise, mid and low range games run very well. It is so much fun playing Ludo on the huge screen though. And in this long time of using the Nova 2i, I have never once had to visit a service center.  Conclusion  For the time I have used the Huawei Nova 2i, I have been satisfied with the performance it has provided. Yes, it has frozen sometimes but I think I was a bit hard on my device as I don’t frequently clean apps. The phone has not slowed down as I expected it to. Similarly, the battery life has pretty much held up for me as an average user. Only sometimes I have had to put it on charge twice a day. The camera department is still lit as it was before. And the Nova 2i is now available for Rs. 30,900 so with the kind of performance it provides, I think it is a worth it buy at this price. However, with the launch of the  Huawei Y9 2018 , this one may have lost its charm as the Y9 is pretty similar to this one except for the cameras and storage.     Pros  Cons    Durable Build  Average Gaming Performance    Good display  No fast Charging    Good selfie and back cameras     Timely updates']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/novi-2i-long-term-review.jpg']

Both the devices’ displays have full HD resolution with Gorilla Glass 4 protection on the top.  The Xperia XA2 and XA2 Ultra come in a traditional form factor with bezels on the top and bottom. At a time when bezel-less displays are trending, it is really strange that the devices, for what they are worth, are still traditional.

The selfie camera is where another difference between the devices lie. The Xperia XA2 has an 8-megapixel lens with an f/2.4 aperture whereas the XA2 Ultra features dual cameras measuring 16- and 8-megapixel. The 16-megapixel lens on the front also has OIS.

The Sony Xperia L2 has slightly less bezels than what we usually see on Sony smartphones. However, unlike the 2018 trend of minimal bezels and an elongated display, this device has a little chunk of bezels on the top and bottom sandwiching the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio display. The Xperia L2 sports a 5.5-inch HD display which is a major disappointment as the most of the smartphones of this price segment have already picked up on the full HD resolution bandwagon. This display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection against scratches and drops.         In the internals, the Sony Xperia L2 comes with the same processor as its predecessor.

['Huawei Y7 Pro 2018 Review: A new benchmark for the budget smartphones?'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 14, 2018']",2018-05-14 14:57:53+00:00,"['Dual camera used to define premium flagship status a couple of years back. But over time, because of the people’s love for the dual camera and the fancy portrait shots that comes with it, the dual camera has been a mainstream feature these days even in the  mid-range handsets . Despite this breakthrough, the dual camera still is a rare feature in the  budget smartphones . And there is this recently launched  Huawei Y7 Pro 2018 , which sports a  dual camera setup  at the back. On top of that, the smartphone comes with the display that features 18:9 aspect ratio, which seems to be trendy these days. With these features, is the Huawei Y7 Pro going to set new standards for the budget smartphones? Let’s find out in this Huawei Y7 Pro 2018 review.  Huawei Y7 Pro Specifications      Dimensions  158.3 X 76.7 X 7.8 mm    Weight  155gms    Display  5.99-inch HD+ (1440X720 pixels); 268ppi    Chipset  Qualcomm MSM8937 (Snapdragon 430)    Processor  Cortex A53 Octacore @1.4Ghz (28nm)    GPU  Adreno 505    Back Camera  Dual Camera (13MP + 2MP) with LED flash    Front Camera  8MP with Selfie Toning Flash    RAM  3GB DDR3    ROM  32GB eMMC 5.1; microSD upto 256GB (dedicated slot)    OS  Android 8.0 Oreo with EMUI 8.0    Sensors  Proximity, Accelerometer    Battery  3000mAh    Connectivity  Dual Nano SIM (4G + 4G), WiFi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, micro USB 2.0, 3.5mm headphone jack    Color Options  Black, Gold, Blue    Price  Rs. 20,900      Design and build   Let’s get started with the design and build side of the things. At first glance, the Y7 Pro might feel like a metal body, but comparing side by side with the  Huawei Y9 2018  and  Nova 2i , you will quickly realize the Y7 Pro has a plastic body. This might turn you off, but the plastic construction has surely made the device light adding ease to hold and on the use. The glossy metallic frame has added a premium texture to the device and also prevents the flexes. Looks wise, it surely is a handsome lad, but I am not quite sure how the plastic body will endure for a longer period of time.        Display  Up front, the Huawei Y7 Pro features a tall 6-inch display with a trendy 18:9 aspect ratio. This tall display might interest the multimedia enthusiasts. However, compared with Full HD+ phones, one can surely feel the lack of sharpness.   Also, the display looks a little too faded and colors seem washed out. However, the display of the device was bright enough and legible even on the outdoor conditions. And I am thoroughly pleased with the presence of the ambient light sensor, which saved me from the hassle of adjusting the brightness level every now and then.  Performance  The Huawei Y7 Pro comes with a very, very average Snapdragon 430 chipset. We have seen this processor on many budget phones, but how does it fare on a $200 smartphone?  And Comparing it with other smartphones, it is evident that the Y7 Pro should have gone with a slightly powerful Kirin 659 SoC or Snapdragon 625 Chipset. So, bottom line: If you are a light user, you might not feel the difference, but you will notice minor lags when you try to multitask and execute heavy apps.  While digging into the gaming aspect, I didn’t find any issues while playing the light games like Dunk Shot, 8 Ball Pool, and Dunk hit ran really smoothly. So no complaints whatsoever. But when I played the Zombie Avenger, which is another light game, I had to endure lags more than once. When I played the heavy games like  Asphalt 8 , there were few evident stutters but the game was still playable. And talking about the heating issues, the device starts to heat up quite easily. Even while playing light games and apps, the temperature starts to rise gradually on the portion near the camera, however, it’s nothing of a major issue.  Software  On the software\xa0side, the smartphone comes with the  Android Oreo  out of the box. To spice up a little bit, Huawei added their own EMUI 8.0 on the top. I used last year’s  Huawei Y7 ,  Y7 Prime , and even the  Nova 2i . I didn’t see much of a difference this time around. It seems a little polished but the amount of bloatware still remains the same. Most of the bloatware in the device is either redundant or useless. Since I prefer  stock version of Android , the UI on the device didn’t please me much. However, I must honestly praise the addition of Eye Comfort feature in this handset. This feature filters the  blue light  from the display and prevents eye strain caused by the display while viewing the content on it. And I, being an avid reader found this feature surprisingly handy.  Camera  Huawei Y7 Pro houses a dual camera at the back. It is one of the most affordable smartphones to feature a dual camera on the back.\xa0 Normal photos were fine and detailed most of the time. But sometimes, the colors of the subject in the images were little faded as per my liking.   Another thing I noticed about the Huawei Y7 Pro 2018 was the shutter lag on the camera. The slow shutter speed of the camera sometimes resulted in blurry images.  With dual camera onboard, the portrait shots were “OK” at best. It’s not as good as Huawei Y9 or Nova 2i when compared side by side. Despite the presence of substantial amount of details, the sketchy edge detection was noticeable almost every time I took portrait shots. However, it’s satisfying to see Huawei is trying to bring in some good camera features in its budget phones with dual camera setup, which is kind of rare at the moment in Nepal market.        1  of 7                                                                                        Moving on to the front, there is an 8MP selfie shooter with an LED flash right on the forehead chin. The front camera captures some excellent-looking selfies. There is also the Beauty mode for the people, who want beautification in their selfies in the real-time. This feature usually comes handy for the people like me, who hate to edit and process the images after taking the shots. Another cool feature I liked about this handset is the nighttime selfies. When there is really low light to take selfies, the sensor detects deficiency of light and triggers the front LED flash.  Security  On to the security side, there is no fingerprint sensor on the smartphone. Since Huawei had fast and accurate fingerprint sensor over the years, I was surprised to find empty back on the phone and nothing but logo on the chin bezel.   Typing pin/password and drawing patterns to unlock the phone is absolutely boring in 2018. Nonetheless, Huawei managed to add face unlock feature as a consolation. However, the face unlock feature in the Y7 Pro is little sluggish and took me a little more than a second to unlock the device. In addition, this sluggish Face Unlock feature doesn’t work at all in the dark.  So not just Huawei, I want to request all the smartphone manufacturers to kindly include a fingerprint sensor on their device. Not just for luxury, this feature has been an absolute need these days.  Battery  The handset comes with the 3000 mAh battery, which backed me for almost a day on the normal use. And the screen-on-time was around 5 hours. I was pretty satisfied with the backup is provided. With the stock charger of 5V, 1A, it took me around 3 hours to get the battery fully charged. But during the course of review time, I used a more powerful charger rated 5V, 2A which accelerated the charging process. And the battery got refilled in just 2 hours’ time. So, if the prolonged charging time bothers you as well you can spend a couple of bucks for a 5V, 2A charger.  Conclusion  To sum it up, Huawei Y7 Pro 2018 is kind of a mixed bag. On the good side, it has got a good design, trendy 18:9 aspect ratio, reliable battery life, and a good set of cameras. However, had Huawei included FHD screen and maybe its own Kirin Processor at this price range it would have been even better.   So, If you are looking for a better display and a more powerful processor, you will have plenty of options out there or you can also opt for it’s bigger sibling Huawei Y9 by investing more. But, if you are looking for a good camera phone, but within a tight budget range, then the Y7 Pro would be a good buy.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/huawei-y7-pro-2018-review.jpg']

But in recent times, Chinese brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and even Nepal’s own Colors Mobile have really stepped up their game.  In the middle of all this, Samsung has come up a new smartphone dubbed the Galaxy J2 4G. It shares the exact same hardware as the regular J2, but this time with 4G connectivity. With a price tag of Rs 11,390, let’s find out if it can compete with the rest of its competitors in the same price point.       Samsung Galaxy J2 4G Specification     Display  4.7-inch qHD AMOLED    Processor  1.3GHz Quad-Core Exynos 3475    Memory  1GB RAM, 8GB Internal Storage,\xa0expandable (up to 256GB) via micro SD slot    Operating system  Android 5.1\xa0Lollipop    Connectivity  Dual SIM (micro + micro) with 4G LTE    Primary Camera  5MP f/2.2 Aperture, LED flash    Front Camera  2MP f/2.2 Aperture    Battery  2,000mAh    Price in Nepal  Rs 11,390      Design and Build  The smartphone looks almost exactly the same as any other  Galaxy J2 smartphone . Frankly speaking, the design language hasn’t changed much since the first Galaxy J2 back in 2015. It flaunts a plastic body with a removable back cover giving you access to the battery alongside two SIM slots and a Micro SD card slot.\xa0        It’s a very simple looking smartphone with two captive touch buttons and a classic Samsung home button at the front. On the back lies the 5MP camera alongside the flash and a loudspeaker. On the left, you will find the volume buttons, and on the right the power button. The bottom holds the micro USB port and the headphone jack lies at the top.  I did manage to drop the phone several times, and it came off without any serious damage, apart from the few dents and scuffs.\xa0This is one of the best-built smartphones out there, among its competitors of course. It has a sturdy design, with very few creaks and squeaks\xa0and a very wholesome feel in hand.  Display  Display shares the same story as the built of the device. The screen sizes in at 4.7 inches, which most people will find tiny and hard to use, especially with a resolution of 960*540 pixels. But frankly, it’s not half as bad, thanks to the AMOLED panel which produces good colors and an above average viewing experience.  The problem is, the display is usable, but comparing it with other smartphones with the same or even cheaper prices, you usually get at-least an HD display, which is a must on a smartphone in 2018. Also, the 4.7-inch display will be a deal breaker for most, considering there are up to 5.5-inch display options as well.  Software and UI  This is where the smartphone starts to show off its quirks. For some unknown reason, the J2 4G edition runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. It’s a relatively old version of Android for a smartphone launching in 2018. Nevertheless, you will not feel like you are missing out on something. You might feel traveling back in time having this outdated OS in its system.\xa0In addition, you should also have to tussle with the lags and sluggishness due to the lack of RAM and processing power of the phone.  The UI itself lags a lot, with frequent shutters and reloading processes. It was a frustration when I failed to do anything slightly demanding with this smartphone. For the more basic users, who primarily use a phone to call and text, this phone will do just fine.  We can see that people eying a smartphone like the J2 won’t be bothered by which OS their smartphone is currently running. For the same reason, we didn’t let it bother us either. What does bother us is the lack of OS optimization which just makes the device pretty unusable and unpleasant.  Performance  Performance\xa0is not a strong suit for this smartphone, in fact, it’s one of the worst out there. It’s a budget smartphone that was meant to do the most basic tasks. Calls, alarms, cameras, browsing the web work well. What doesn’t work well are the full versions of any app. For instance, you will be better off using the Facebook Lite, Messenger lite or any stripped down version of an app.  I had a horrible time with the full versions of the apps which struggled to work at all. These apps really take a toll on the Exynos 3475 and the mere 1GB of RAM the device comes with. More noticeably the frequent UI restarts was a true frustration. This is a device that could really make great use of the \xa0 recently released\xa0Android Go from Google. You can take a look at the benchmark scores below and judge the device yourself.   Storage  The smartphone comes with 8GB of onboard storage, which might be enough for some. Considering the phone struggles with the full version of apps, I installed and used the lite version of the apps. Such lite app relatively takes less storage space when installed and operated. Moreover, installing such light app left enough space available for me because of which I had been able to store adequate files in the onboard storage. Despite the memory management with lite apps, the internal storage was still insufficient for me so I had to employ an SDcard for the purpose.  Camera  Samsung devices have always featured good cameras but seems like this one is an exception. It’s has a 5MP sensor with f/2.2 aperture camera and an LED flash also capable of up to 720p video captures.\xa0No matter how hard you try, you cannot overcome its lack of sharpness. Lack of details was evident in the images and the colors were washed out most of the time.                Talking about the front camera, the 2MP f/2.2 aperture camera, almost all the time took blurred photos. A steady hand and a well-lit room might produce some decent selfies. It is also capable of video recordings of up to 640*480 resolutions.          We get that it’s a budget smartphone but just look at the competition. The  Colors P85+ Selfie Pro  has a 13MP rear and 8MP front camera which takes a lot better pictures comparatively.  Battery  The smartphone holds a 2000mAh battery, which will get you through a day’s usage. In terms of SOT, I got about 3 to 4 hours of usage, which I consider a day’s worth. Charging time is less than two hours, thanks to the small battery capacity.  Is the battery usable? sure! but competitors pack their smartphones with 3000 and sometimes even 4000mAh batteries. These smartphones boast up to 6 hours of SOT, especially considering the targeted buyers will expect a good battery life.  Connectivity  The Samsung Galaxy J2 4G Edition supports 4G connectivity, alongside Bluetooth 4.1, and 802.11n WiFi. 4G worked as well as on any other smartphone, the best result we got was a maximum of 7.34Mbps down, 10.43Mbps up and latency of around 23ms.\xa0  The sensors on the device include an accelerometer and a proximity sensor, which seem enough for day to day usage. Although the call quality wasn’t really something to brag about. Especially when you are on a crowded bus or on open roads, both parties failed to exchange conversations with ease.  Conclusion  You can buy yourself a Samsung Galaxy J2 4G edition for a price of Rs 11,290. For it’s asking price, the smartphone does a few things well. But with just 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal memory to spare, Samsung could have immensely made use of  Android Go . Also, the small battery capacity was a huge bummer.  Buyers do have an option to use the Android Go apps from the Play-store whenever possible. But if in the near future, they do decide to create another smartphone with similar specs, Android Go does sound a lot more promising.  Budget smartphones are getting better by the day, and Samsung really needs to up their game in this segment. The J2 follows the same old tradition of a budget smartphone. It features an outdated software, sluggish performance, barely sufficient battery, and a really mediocre camera setup.  All of which you could avoid if you choose something like a Colors P85+. Even cheaper options like the  Xiaomi Redmi 4A  will give you an HD display, better performance, and a slightly better camera not to mention the bump in storage and battery while actually saving you money.  My personal suggestion would be to invest a bit more and go for smartphones like the  Nokia 2 ,  Huawei Y7  or the  Redmi Note 5A . Plus if you plan on using the smartphone for about 1-2 years like everyone else, the extra money you invest on one will definitely be worth it.

['Umidigi S2 Pro Review: A Midrange Killer?'],"['Reviews', 'UMIDIGI']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['May 11, 2018']",2018-05-11 11:44:34+00:00,"['We have seen an influx of Chinese smartphones in recent years. There are plenty of Chinese brands that offer great hardware specs for fraction of the price. The  Umidigi S2 Pro \xa0offers full view display, metal unibody, and a  dual camera setup .\xa0So, let’s see how this device stacks up against the mid-range bunch in our Umidigi S2 pro review.  Design   The first thing you will notice right off the bat is that bright red color of the phone. We particularly liked the bright color but you can opt for the more subtle black option. The phone has a unibody metal construct and the feel of the phone is premium on the hand. Being a tall phone, you can easily carry it around but it’s not ideal for one hand usage.         The phone has slipped too many times from my hands and from my pocket due to its slippery polished back. So, a back cover is a must and Umidigi has provided one inside the box.  If you are against a back cover, it is worth mentioning that this phone doesn’t get any scratches. During my review period, I constantly kept the phone in my pocket along with keys when I am driving. And surprisingly, the phone didn’t get any scratches. The phone also doesn’t attract any fingerprints and it’s super easy to just wipe off any dust from its surface.   The phone although is on the chunky side, the curve back does a good job of hiding its thickness. On the plus side, the phone is splash and dust resistance as well which is an awesome feature to see in a mid-range segment.  Display  The Umidigi S2 Pro comes with a tall 18:9 aspect ratio featuring a 6-inch Full HD+ IPS LCD display. We would have loved to see an AMOLED panel which would have made the display punch better with deep blacks and high contrasts. Its competition like the  Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro  has an AMOLED panel to enhance its viewing.   However, the display panel is bright and vibrant. I really enjoyed watching videos and playing games on this huge display. It also gets bright enough to be clearly visible outdoors and there are no color shifts at all with varying angles. The display is protected by Gorilla Glass 4. You have MiraVision to change the Color mode and have some additional control over the display.  Performance  The Umidigi S2 Pro is powered by Mediatek’s Helio P25 octa-core chipset clocked at 2.5GHz. What’s offered here may not be a high-end performance chipset, but considering the price of $279, it delivers the power when you ask for it.  Normal navigation, scrolling, and all the basic tasks can be carried out without breaking a sweat. When it comes to gaming, the Asphalt 8 was well playable with no noticeable frame drops or lags. I also tried the new PUBG for mobile and it automatically rendered on low quality. The game was pretty much playable on low quality, but there were minor lags here and there as I played. The phone does heat up after a while of gaming but it stays constant and there’s nothing too serious so you can continue for hours.  The phone offers 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM. You can easily switch between multiple apps opened in the background without breaking a sweat. Turning on the battery saving options do affect the multitasking ability to some extent. Nonetheless, the phone is a capable performer and it would suffice the need of an average user.  Software  The phone is running on Android 7.0 Nougat, which is pretty outdated by today’s standard. This phone is running the heavily skinned UMI OS 2.0. Like any Chinese OEM’s there’s no app drawer and to my surprise, this is the only Chinese phone I know of that completely restricts the user from using third-party launchers. I couldn’t be more disappointed.  Adding to a load of disappointment is the bloatware and they are everywhere, so much so that you could fill up an entire screen with it. This bloatware includes Speed Up cache cleaner, a security app that also acts as a cache cleaner, an App Clean Up that clears the cache, so you get the gist here. There are also dual apps, quick touch, and others include an app store from UMI and theme store.      Umidigi S2 Pro | Software UI    1  of 3               Home Screen         Notification Panel         Multitasking Panel                      That’s already a lot of app on first boot to overwhelm anyone. Fortunately, some of them can be uninstalled and some stay with you for eternity. The inclusion of  blue light filter  and anti-theft are neat features.  Camera  For me, the purchasing decision of a smartphone comes down to the camera, and I believe it is the same for most of us as well. The Umidigi S2 Pro comes with the dual rear camera in a pair of 13MP + 5MP with f/2.0 aperture. The secondary lens is here for the bokeh effect. And the first thing I tried with its camera was the bokeh effect and it really didn’t impress me much. The bokeh effect just felt a complete hit or miss. Often times there would be a whole area outside the subject without any blur and sometimes half of the subject would be blurred out.  Coming to the image quality of the phone, the pictures it takes has a good amount of saturation with its image processing. If you love punchy colors in your pictures like that from the Samsung phones then you’d love what it has to offer. On Zooming in details as you can see in the images are well preserved in good lighting conditions. What I’ve noticed from the samples is, the phone increases the highlights making the images bright but despite that, the images maintain a very close to the natural color.        1  of 6                                                                              The shutter is quite snappy so you can capture fast moving life as it’s happening. There aren’t plenty of shooting modes here, but you get few standard ones like the slo-mo which creates a jittery gif like slow motion video, time lapse, and color filters. The phone doesn’t offer pro mode, however. The S2 Pro is capable of shooting 4K videos but the quality is not up to par.  Now coming to the front 16MP camera of the device I thought it’d be fun but upon seeing the results I couldn’t be more disappointed with it. Images have pink tint overlay and even with enough light, the image contained few grains and dark spots. There is face beauty mode, and face cute mode with AR stickers.   Connectivity  Talking about connectivity, the phone lacks a headphone jack. And to deal with that the phone does offer USB C to 3.5mm headphone jack dongle. The S2 Pro comes with dual nano-hybrid SIM Slot. With 128GB storage on board, you will rarely use any extra SD card with such enormous storage.  It has all the wireless connectivity options such as WiFi (ac), Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS.   Security  For security, you get fingerprint sensor along with face unlock. The face unlock is way slow when compared to the one on OnePlus 5T or even the Vivo V9. It takes about 1 or 2 seconds to unlock the phone.  Battery  One of the biggest assets of the phone is its mammoth 5100mAh battery. Now, this size is something that we don’t see often on smartphones and it’s here to solve one of our biggest issue of battery drainage. The phone is a beast when it comes battery life providing 2 days of backup. I would always have 40-50% battery left on my phone at the end of the day – my usage mostly included browsing social media, taking photos, and gaming.   The phone offers Pump Charge 2.0 fast charging that charges the device within 2 hours. It feels reasonable considering the size of the battery.  Verdict  The Umidigi S2 Pro definitely has got the hardware punch that we don’t see in the midrange phone under $300. The phone comes with a beautifully crafted metal body, ample 128GB of storage and a mammoth 5100 mAh battery.  This phone is definitely a good pick for someone looking for a good aesthetic, more storage, and a 2 days battery life. But on the contrary, the poor selfie camera and iffy UI can turn you down. But in my opinion, it’s a small tradeoff for all the goods you are getting for the price.  However, in Nepal, you need to pay an exorbitant price (Rs.54,900) if you buy the phone from the official channel.

['Huawei Y9 2018 review: A threat for midrange players?'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['May 11, 2018']",2018-05-11 07:33:12+00:00,"['If you are familiar with the  Huawei Nova 2i , the  Huawei Y9 2018  is not something new for you. Like the Nova 2i, this one packs industry’s top features like a bezel-less display with 18:9 aspect ratio, quad cameras, an FHD+ screen, etc. But all these come for a price of just Rs. 25,900 whereas the Nova 2i comes for seven thousand more that too with almost similar specs. So, is this phone really as good as it looks or is there something fishy going on? Let’s find out in on our Huawei Y9 2018 review.   Huawei Y9 2018 Specifications:   Display : 5.93-inch FullHD IPS LCD multi-touch capacitive 2D curved glass  CPU : Octa-core clocked at 2.36 GHz  Chipset : Kirin HiSilicon 659  GPU : ARM Mali- T8360 MP2  RAM : 3 GB DDR3  Internal Storage : 32 GB  Operating System : Android Oreo 8.0 with Huawei’s own UI 8.0 on top  Rear camera : 16+2 MP with autofocus, continuous shooting, Geo tagging, digital zoom, HDR, panorama, touch focus, face- detection, etc  Front camera : 13+2 MP  Sensors : Light, Proximity, Compass, Accelerometer, Fingerprint, Gyroscope, etc  Battery : 4,000 mAh non-removable   Huawei Y9 2018 Price in Nepal: Rs. 25,900    Design  I never had a complaint about Nova 2i’s design, I don’t have a complaint about Y9’s design either. The Y9 2018 looks sleek and stylish with the huge 5.9-inch screen wrapped around an aluminum alloy body with an 18:9 aspect ratio. I am using the blue variant which I have fallen in love with.         At the back, you will see a dual horizontal camera set up along with an LED flash and a fingerprint scanner just below it. Everything looks good and in place. I did not use a cover and I was impressed that this one does not attract smudge or fingerprints. The phone is comfortable to hold and looks good on hands.   However, one slight concern is that the device is slippery and tends to fall out of hands. It is in such instances that I have felt a need for display protection and as the Y9 provides none, you have to be very careful using it.  Display  The Huawei Y9 2018 has a 5.93-inch IPS LCD touchscreen with FHD+ screen resolution. The display is crisp and viewing content in it is a welcoming experience. If you are suffering from visual fatigue like I am, you will surely find the eye comfort mode useful.  Other than that, the viewing angles, color accuracy (slightly bluish tone), and contrast of the display are good and it also provides ample brightness for you even under sunlight.  Performance  Like the Nova 2i, the Huawei Y9 2018 features the Kirin Hi-silicon 659 processor along with the Mali T830 MP2 GPU. The device, I must say has handled all my multitasking needs without breaking a sweat. Never once has it broken down on my use. Although 3GB RAM seems ample for usage, I still would like to have 1GB more on my device because the others are providing it in the same price range.  Similarly, Huawei is providing 32GB of internal storage, which is a lot less! I mean, on today’s date, I would not want to do the hassle of getting a separate memory card. So, if you don’t add an SD card, you are certainly going to fall short on storage with the Huawei Y9 2018. Thankfully, Huawei has provided a dedicated microSD card slot.   There are a lot of apps onboard that weren’t useful to me, some I had an option to uninstall, some I didn’t. It would have been better if the company had chosen to keep the onboard apps to a minimum considering the low storage it provides, but seems like Huawei has not thought about this.  Gaming was fun in this device, well at low to medium settings. When you go higher on settings, you will feel lags.\xa0 When I played Asphalt 8, at very low settings, the game ran well but at the medium to high settings, the game lagged. Low and midrange games ran quite well.  If you ask me about heating, I would say that this device does get warm after gaming. At normal use, I have not felt the temperature rise. However, I don’t mean that the temperature rises to become unbearable, but yes, it gets warm. It’s only common for devices to have that tendency.  Software and UI  The Huawei Y9 2018 comes with Android Oreo 8.0 coupled with EMUI 8.0. I feel like the UI on Huawei devices is very simple and same is the case with this one. There are customizable notification icons when you swipe downwards, you can change sliding transitions. You can get to the smart care feature by Huawei by swiping to the left, which well was not useful to me.      Huawei Y9 | Software UI    1  of 4               home screen         folders         notification          multitasking                        Like the Nova 2i, this one too supports smart gestures like swiping three down to take a screenshot or swiping a finger down the fingerprint sensor to get access to notification icons, tapping twice on the screen to turn it on, etc. I like it when companies include such features, I mean these are not very essential or extraordinary but still, it’s fun using them.  Back Camera  The Huawei Y9 2018 has a dual 13+2 MP camera setup at the back. If you look at the pictures I have clicked on this device, the images have a bit more contrast and the images are darker than normal. Similarly, when you are focusing on an object with a white background, it looks overexposed. So, the images are sharp indeed but come out over slightly exposed in a bright environment.  Something that I wanted to test was the portrait mode of this device. The images from the Nova 2i are very bright and punchy whereas from the Y9, they are bit dark and high in contrast. Similarly, both the phones do not have proper edge detection when it comes to portraits shots.      Huawei Y9 | Back Camera Samples   1  of 4                                                          I tested covering the secondary lenses of both the front and back camera, and yes like the Nova 2i, they properly function to create depth of field. So, you can be ensured that it’s the software that produces the blur, it’s the cameras themselves.  Front Camera  I have quite liked the selfies form this device mainly because it does not make your skin look fairer then it is. Mostly, when you take selfies from smartphones, your skin tends to look brighter, fairer and somewhat beautified. But this one is not at all like that. Again I would say that the images are a bit dark but it preserves the right amount of details. So, I have quite liked them. Not to forget, there is a dual 16+2 MP camera setup at the front too. Again, the images have slightly inaccurate edge detection.      Huawei Y9 | Selfie Samples    1  of 2               Normal Mode          Bokeh Mode                   Overall, I would say that I liked the cameras but when you compare it with Nova 2i, I would prefer Nova 2i.  Security  The fingerprint sensor is snappy on use but I have used it only a few times because I got used to using the facial unlock. It works 90% of the times but when its dark, it may not recognize you sometimes. Other times, its swift.   Audio & Call Quality  The speakers are positioned in the lower portion and are decently loud. But the fact that they get covered most of the times while playing games ruins the fun, so I had to be careful to avoid covering them. Other than that, call quality and network coverage are good.  Battery  Something that has thoroughly satisfied me about the Y9 2018 is the battery. The device has a huge 4,000 mAh battery that can back you up for a day entire after intense usage like gaming and watching videos. At light usage, like for social media, clicking pictures and the like, you get a life of nearly two days on a single charge.   The device took me 2 hours and around 10 minutes to get charged and a screen on time of 8 hours. I know the inclusion of fast charging support is fancy on today’s date but I think the addition of a battery this large in capacity is a balanced effort by Huawei.  Conclusion:  The Huawei Y9 is an affordable version of the Nova 2i which pretty much similar everything except for the cameras and storage option. Summing up, the things I have liked on this device are the display, design, and the most certainly the Battery life.  The cameras, though are not as same as the Nova 2i, but still, perform good enough for the price you are paying. The performance section, like the Nova 2i is decent and will suffice the need of an average user like me.  But if you are a heavy gamer, opting for the  Galaxy J7 Duo  would suffice the need as it comes with a powerful Exynos 7884 chipset. If storage and stock Android experience is your topmost priority, there’s  Mi A1  with 64GB storage and pure android.  So, if you ask me if getting this phone is a good decision, I would say that if storage and gaming performance is not a concern for you, the device pretty much lives up to your expectations.      Pros  Cons    Sleek Design  Average gaming performance    Good display  Low storage options    Commendable battery life  No fast charging    Good selfie and back cameras']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/huawei-y9-2018-review.jpg']
['Who should be the sole distributor of Xiaomi products in Nepal?'],"['Opinion', 'Xiaomi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 11, 2018']",2018-05-11 02:23:32+00:00,"['There was news flying in the social media about the appointment of Teletalk as the new authorized distributor of Xiaomi in Nepal. Since the news was around in the first week of April, most of the people thought it was a hoax. And it took time for the people to process the information and realize it as a truth. The main reason for the disbelief at first was a huge difference in the price of the smartphone than one set by the Vatsal Impex, which had been around the market as the sole authorized distributor of  Xiaomi products in Nepal  for almost three years. Probably, that’s the reason why Teletalk has been hailed by the public with higher votes ( 63% over 37% while writing this article) in our poll. [socialpoll id=”2496255″] In the early days, there were few smartphone brands in Nepal and Samsung had gained nearly 70% of the smartphone market share. People had few choices back then. During that time the brand Xiaomi emerged, which used to deliver products offering a good value for money: bang for the buck we would like to call it.  However, the smartphone from Xiaomi was not available in Nepal during that time. Despite the unavailability, the features packed in the smartphones lured people so much that they owned  Xiaomi smartphone  buying from the gray market. And a little later, when Vatsal Impex Pvt. Ltd. was designated as the authorized distributor of Xiaomi products in Nepal, everyone was excited.        Also Read:  Xiaomi Mobiles Price in Nepal  But the things didn’t go as the way the customers expected. Soon After taking the job, Vatsal launched outdated smartphones like the  Xiaomi MI 4  and the  Redmi Note 2 , which were priced exorbitantly. The smartphone launched thereafter were not cheap either. Vatsal Impex used to mark the price at 30-40% higher on every other smartphone that followed next. Sometimes the price was as high as 1.5 times the price in the India/China market.  Deals: Grab Xiaomi Redmi 4A at Cheapest Price along with Free Offers  Xiaomi smartphones are renowned for providing remarkable specs at the affordable prices. However, that hadn’t been the case in Nepal. Even in the long journey of three years, the pricing attitude of Vatsal Impex had not changed a bit. Probably that the reason why the officials find a new way to sort out the problem; by appointing a new distributor. When Teletalk was appointed as the new distributor, the price of the smartphone became really affordable.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4  (3/32GB) priced around Rs. 23,000 back then is now available for Rs. 18,999 and  Xiaomi MI A1  priced at Rs. 29,999 (4/64GB) can now be purchased at Rs. 24,999 via Teletalk.  When Teletalk was delegated as the added as a distributor, the selling territory was also well defined. Teletalk was allowed to make sales outside the valley whereas Vatsal would do the sales inside the valley. For the sales coverage inside the valley, Teletalk was also permitted to make use of an online platform. So Teletalk partnered with SastoDeal to make sales inside the valley. Similar privileges were there for Vatsal too for selling its smartphones outside the valley. And for the process, Vatsal wooed Daraz for online transactions outside the valley.

And the thing to note here is that Vatsal Impex dropped the price on the smartphones which are also being sold by the Teletalk. Vatsal Impex found it useless to slash the price on the smartphones that are not available through Teletalk. Probably that has been the reason, why people seem to go against Vatsal so fiercely. Their main rage for Vatsal is that if the things could be sold at such affordable prices then why such a loot? And why is there not a price drop on other phones?  Another main weakness seen from the Vatsal over the years is the late launches of phones in Nepal.  Xiaomi Redmi 5 Pro , the most loved and most awaited phone is the fan base is still not available in Nepal. Probably these are the reasons that obliged the users to dislike Vatsal and opt for Teletalk among the two. Our followers have voted against Vatsal and preferred Teletalk in the poll. However, on contrary to our followers’ vote, our vote would be for the presence of both the distributors like now. So that there would not be a monopoly and each distributor would mark the price on their product competitively. And we (the customers/users) can own the Xiaomi smartphones at an affordable price.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Xiaomi-mobiles-price-in-nepal.jpg']
['Google I/O 2018: Everything you need to know'],"['Android', 'Google', 'Google I/O']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['May 9, 2018']",2018-05-09 09:36:16+00:00,"['Google wants to become the leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) company and the Californian company proved its determination in its annual I/O conference. The event started from May 8 and will run till May 10, 2018, in California. The Google CEO Sundar Pichai hosted the conference and many announcements on Android P, Google Home and WearOS among others have been made.  Highlights of Google I/O 2018:  1. Gmail will write your\xa0emails for you   Google announced a huge renovation of Gmail just a couple of weeks ago. It added the abilities to snooze emails and messages and make payments within Gmail iOS application. Yesterday and a new feature called ‘smart compose’ was introduced. Using AI, Gmail can now automatically complete writing emails. Additionally, it predicts and suggests phrases to be added to the email as we write.        2. Android P updates   Google has made many updates regarding Android P. The updates are set to make Android P more efficient and smarter than Android Oreo. The first feature is ‘adaptive battery’ which will help in the reduction of CPU usage by 30%. It will automatically close the apps that are not going to be used for the rest of the day.  ‘Adaptive brightness’ will gain knowledge about the personal preferences through Artificial Intelligence and automatically adjust the brightness you prefer. Also ‘App action’ predicts what you want to do next. It stores the actions you usually do at the same time every day. So, if you always call your friend/ family at a specific time, it will remind you to do so at that exact time.  It is also launching a new Dashboard to Android which will let users monitor the time they consume using their phone. It keeps the record number of times the user unlocks their phone in a day, how long has been spent using specific apps and so on. Android P will also let people set timers on how long they want to use specific apps each day to control usage of the phone. This will be quite helpful for many people. And a new feature ‘Shush’ will be added which will put the phone in ‘do not disturb’ when it is placed face down on a desk.  3. Google Duplex has Assistant to handle your calls   The most astonishing highlight of Google I/O 2018 is the Google Duplex. It has made the Assistant very lifelike. The Google Duplex has no hint of a robotic voice. Duplex has made the conversation with your assistant more interactive and more human-like than any other AI has ever made.\xa0The company also is adding a new feature that allows you to ask multiple questions within the same request. In other words, you don’t have to say “hey Google” or “Ok Google” every single time making the interaction more unnatural.  Google Assistant is now smarter with a natural sounding voice which makes phone calls to book reservations and make appointments. And it doesn’t stop there. It can even handle back and forth Q&A.  4. Google Map will use your camera to display data   With this feature, Google Map will pair with your camera and computer vision technology with Streer View to navigate you to your destination. Here, Google will pair up with Street View data and AR, and turn-by-turn experience will be provided. Google Lens can identify buildings, texts, or even dog breeds, just by pointing your camera at the object.  Google has also introduced a new shortlist feature. It shows you new restaurants and firms that are trending among other users. However, Google hasn’t confirmed whether this feature will come in Google Maps.  5.New Assistant Voices   Google now has six new virtual assistant voices – including singer John Legend’s. And thanks to Duplex, it might speak like we do. It can train kids, customize Google Routines, and order carries outs. Amazon Echo will face some tough competition now with similar devices running on Google’s software. Smart Display with Google Assistant will be launched in July.  6. Android P beta is now available   Android P beta has now been made accessible by Google. Google is launching its public beta to 8 manufactures. So, the new beta is available to handsets like Pixel, OnePlus, Nokia, Sony, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and the Essential phones.  7. Google News will be curated by AI   Yes, it’s true. Google news app is renovated and is being powered by AI. The firm’s AI analyzes all the contents published on the internet and organized all the data, articles, images, videos and storylines. It looks for data that is interesting and puts them for your\xa0briefing. Among the thousands of true as well as fake headlines and news, Google News lists out the news that is\xa0written and shot by award-winning national reporters, journalists, and insightful bloggers.  8. Smarter Lens   Google lens has also received a long-awaited update. The Lens includes smart text selection which will help the camera to understand words. In other words, it can copy text from the real world like books, menus, tags, and then paste it into the text field on the smartphone. Another feature of Lens is that it can identify price of clothing, food, landmarks, and fashion as well. Although it isn’t perfect yet, it does the job.  9. Smarter editing powers in Google Photos  Google Photos has added a major AI-powered feature that can B&W photo colour correction, brightness correction and suggested rotations. It has powerful tools to edit, modify and sort photos.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-io-2018.jpg']

With the Android Oreo 8.0 and EMUI 8.0 update, there are subtle changes in the UI, that might not be noticeable. For instance, you now get an option to snooze notifications in the notification bar as per your liking. Similarly, you get an enhanced notification bar. Likewise, the device supports better app launching with the new Oreo 8.0 update.  Apart from that, there is a new Picture-in-Picture mode that helps you create a picture-in-picture window while the app is open or after you leave it so that you can continue with your tasks. The device, with this update, is also said to have a better and optimized battery life and a quicker app opening time. Also, there is a smart text detection mode that Huawei has included in its latest update.  Although there are not many changes that have happened with this update, it’s good to know that your device runs on the latest version of Android considering some devices in the same price range are still running on stale versions.

Vivo has come up with another smartphone in its V9 series and this time it is called ‘Vivo V9 youth’, a toned down version of the  Vivo V9 . Let’s see if the specifications are interesting as well.   The Vivo V9 youth has an aluminum body and a glass front. It packs with it an IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen and stands 6.3 inches tall. It contains a full-HD+ resolution. The smartphone also allows multi-touch and the front is built of corning gorilla glass 3.         The Vivo V9 youth runs on Android Oreo 8.1 and is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 octa-core processor. Which we can refer to as being capable of smooth functioning of the smartphone.  Also Read:  Vivo Mobiles Price in Nepal  It has 4GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. Most of the\xa0smartphones available in the similar price tag are offering 64GB of onboard storage. So Vivo should have opted for 64GB of onboard storage at the least. And along with that 32GB of internal memory, Vivo is offering a dedicated microSD slot expand the memory up to 256GB.  On the camera front, it has a  dual camera setup  of 16+2 MP each with dual-tone LED flash while the front camera is of 16MP. This is not that bad of a deal after all.

['Vivo V9 Review: Stuck in Mediocrity'],['Reviews'],['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['May 4, 2018']",2018-05-04 09:03:33+00:00,"['In 2016, Google reported 24 Billion selfies uploaded in its photo application. In the same year, some people were reported taking as many as 20, 50 or even 100 selfies in a week. It’s no surprise that in 2018, the hype has only increased. After knowing this, I have come to the realization that selfies are a bigger deal than anyone has ever imagined! And information as such has been very cleverly used by smartphone companies to create camera-centric smartphones.  One of such smartphones is the recently launched  Vivo V9 . Cameras are of course the selling point of Vivo smartphones but apart from that what else does this phone offer? That question will be answered in this review!         Vivo V9 Specifications:   OS: Android Oreo 8.1 with FunTouch UI  Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 626  CPU: Octa-core (2.2 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU: Adreno 506  Display: 6.3 inches IPS LCD with capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors, multitouch with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection  Screen resolution: 2,280×1,080 pixels with 19:9 aspect ratio (400ppi density)  RAM: 4 GB  ROM: 64 GB extendable up to 256 GB (dedicated microSD card slot)  Selfie camera: 24 MP f/2.0  Rear camera: Dual 16+5 MP f/2.0 with phase detection auto-focus, Dual LED flash, Geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, panorama, etc.  Video: 720p, 1080p, 4K  Battery: 3,260 mAh non-removable Li-Ion battery  USB: Micro-USB 2.0, USB On-The-Go  Bluetooth: 4.2, A2DP LE  Sensors: Fingerprint (rear-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, Compass  WLAN: WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, WiFi direct, hotspot  Price: Rs, 37,790   Selfie Camera  First up, let me talk about something that I have liked very much about this device. Yes, it’s the selfie camera. The Vivo V9 sports a massive 24-megapixel selfie camera equipped with AI capabilities. It comes with features like portrait mode, gender and face detection along with AR stickers. I took a lot of selfies from this device and I must say I had very few areas to complain. In the normal mode, the pictures come out sharp and vibrant. The selfies clicked with the V9 come out very accurate and especially outdoors, you will love what you see. The autofocus works quite well. I didn’t find the portrait mode in the selfie camera very useful, but still works good enough.  What I would like to acknowledge is that the beauty mode is not bad in functioning. Unlike most camera smartphones, this does not create fake looking images. The beauty mode works to make your skin look smooth. You can increase or decrease the level of beautification but I would recommend you use the AI option for best results. Also, the AI distinguishes the face in accordance with gender, which I think is good news for boys!  Left: Normal Mode / Right: Beauty Mode  While we are still talking about beautification, like the Oppo F5, the V9 also makes moles disappear magically from the second beauty level!\xa0 Oppo and Vivo both seem to have a huge problem with moles.  The AR sticker feature works like Snapchat, but since Snapchat is not my kind of thing, I didn’t find it very fascinating. But for those who do, you can use a lot of stickers on your selfies. You may quite like it.   Rear Camera  The Vivo V9 has a 16+5 MP dual camera at the rear portion. As I tested the rear camera, I would certainly say that it performs really well. The best part is the fact that the camera is very color accurate. I mean, it has the right amount of punch, vibrancy, contrast, and saturation to them. The images are not over or underexposed and have the right amount of detailing to them.  All of the above-mentioned things is, well, for the fairly lit environment. The low light performance is, however, not as good as the daylight performance. It’s not bad, but it’s not good either as the images are not very sharp in low light.        1  of 3                                                Talking about the cameras, we cannot miss the Portrait mode, can we? I clicked pictures in the portrait mode and the fact that we can adjust the blur before and after taking pictures was good to know.\xa0 The portrait images do appear bright and sharp. What I found to be a tiny problem was that when focusing on a person, the camera only seems to blur out the upper portion while the lower portion was as it is. It’s sad that such good camera suffers slightly inaccurate depth sensing.However, this did not seem to be a problem while the subjects were placed close to the camera. Only at objects far away, the concern arose. Also, you can notice in the pictures that the cameras have poor edge detection.   You have an option to record videos at 4k, 1080p and 720p. The videos at all three resolutions have good stabilization. Also, something that set me off was that autofocus in the video mode did not work very well. Similarly, the slow-motion videos suffer bad quality.  Overall, if I had to judge the cameras, I would say that am very impressed with the kind of images it produces.  Display  The Vivo V9 sports a tall 6.23-inch 1080P display with 19:9 aspect ratio. It is a treat watching videos on the huge display. The content appears sharp, crisp and clear, but the pinkish tint is evident when compared side by side with other smartphones. Also, the good news is that it comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.   The contents are fairly visible under sunlight, so I would say that you will certainly love the kind of display you get on this device.  Design  Talking about the design, when I first carried the Vivo V9 out with me, people asked me if this was the iPhone X.\xa0 Sadly, I could not hide it for too long that it was not! But seriously, this phone has a good resemblance to the iPhone X which begs a question, how can anything be so “inspired” that it looks alike? But other things kept aside, the iPhone X inspired design looks good on the device.Commendable is the fact that the notch is actually shorter than the iPhone X incorporating only the selfie camera and the speaker. What’s impressive is that Vivo has managed to keep the screen to body ratio at 90% implying that only 10% is what we call ‘bezels’.   Unlike most of the smartphones\xa0in the market, this one has a glossy finish which looks good. But what comes with good looks is a smudge-prone device as this one is a complete fingerprint magnet. But I used the cover that came along, so it did not bother me much.   Other than that, the device is unbelievably lightweight, which is, of course, the result of its plastic build. Now here is what I have a slight complaint about. Only if that amazing display would have come wrapped around a metallic build, it would have done so much justice to the price and to the display itself. Another thing is that the buttons are all located on the right side, so it does not create a confusion but I felt that the buttons are not tactile enough.  Performance  The Vivo V9 houses the Snapdragon 626 SoC along with 4GB of DDR3 RAM. Even though this is a very good combination, but for the price, I expected more.\xa0 The phone shows good enough results during normal usage. I mean for surfing the internet, for social networking and other routine tasks, you can entrust yourself with the Vivo V9.  Initially, the device failed to perform accordingly while multitasking and switching between apps! \xa0The performance, in my experience, had been slightly unpredictable at first as some apps crashed now and then. However, with a recent software update, those bugs were fixed and the device performed considerably well. Multitasking and switching through apps were lag free and smooth later with the update.  Moving on, the device features the Adreno 506 GPU which seems to produce satisfactory results while gaming.\xa0 I have played low to high-end games and all of them seem to work fine in the V9. Although, while playing Beat Racer I felt minor lags twice, that didn’t happen anytime again, so, I guess that’s negligible! Other games like The Modern Combat 5, Dead trigger 2 ran well in medium settings. I went on playing games for a considerable long time and while doing so, the temperature never rose to more than 38 degrees. However, for the price, the performance could have been so much better with a better choice of processor, maybe the Snapdragon 636.    Vivo V9 Vs the Competition   Infogram  Software UI  Moving on, The Vivo V9 comes with Android Oreo 8.0 out of the box coupled with Funtouch OS. The UI will certainly give you an IOS feel as you have to swipe upwards to get access to the notification icons, change the brightness, etc.\xa0 Initially, it took me some time to get used to this but eventually I did get accustomed. The app and system notifications still appear at the top.   Talking about the interface again, I loved the animation options this phone provides. It is quite fun and refreshing to see and use them. Apart from that, there are a lot of pre-loaded pointless apps that come along which cannot be deleted. They just sit there watching and eating up your space which is very annoying.  There are some interesting features that thankfully make the user experience fun. Like swiping three fingers up to take a screenshot or swiping three fingers down to create a split screen. It seems amusing when you just shake your phone to turn the flashlight on.  Security & Others  The fingerprint sensor is one of the snappiest and same goes with the facial unlock. It takes around a second to unlock the device with face recognition, which is quite impressive. Under low light conditions, it may take more than one second to recognize you though! The speaker is at the bottom and does a very good job indeed. The call quality and network connection are good too.  Talking about the call quality, I would say that it is good. Similarly, the device supports WiFi\xa0dual-band a/b/g/n/ac, so wifi connectivity, I must acknowledge is decent too!  Battery  The battery is another aspect I have a complaint about. I understand that this is a camera-centric smartphone, but the inclusion of a larger battery would not have hurt considering it has to support such huge screen. For normal usage that is for calling and a good amount of social media, the device runs for a day.   It gave me a screen on time of around 4 hours. Heavy usage like watching videos, gaming, etc. drains the device of its life very easily. Again, it’s 2018 but the device still does not have USB type C. Well, I am not going to talk about fast charging support, as it has none.  Conclusion:  Midrange phones have become more competitive than ever. Although the Vivo V9 has a great selfie camera, a reliable dual camera on the back and a big gorgeous display, it’s in the performance, the battery life and build quality where competitors have easily outperformed the V9 by a good margin.  There are more cons than pros in this device for me to recommend this phone to you. So, maybe Vivo should consider decreasing the price to Rs. 33-34,000.  Right now, I would rather wait for the new A or J-series from Samsung, Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and Huawei P20 Lite which are all set to launch in Nepal in a similar price range.      \xa0Pros  \xa0Cons    Good Display  Average Battery    Good Design  Plastic Build    Good Cameras (both front and back)  Mediocre performance']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VIVO-V9-review.jpg']
['LG announces LG G7 ThinQ with the brightest display and the loudest speaker'],['LG'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 3, 2018']",2018-05-03 04:13:58+00:00,"['In the  MWC 2018 , LG unveiled most of its products geared up for 2018. That lineup included a number of home appliances, which were all AI-injected and the term ThinQ came after that. In that event, LG had also announced a new LG V30 Raspberry Rose smartphone, which was basically the same  LG V30  in a new suit color. With the launch of the V30 Raspberry Rose variant, critics remarked the smartphone nothing but a consolation to LG fans. They also stated the move as the LG’s way to buy the time for a new and great flagship. As predicted, LG G7 ThinQ, the latest flagship offering from the LG comprises of note-worthy and seems all suited to battle other flagships like  Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus ,  iPhone X , etc.  Brightest Display  The G7 ThinQ comes with a tall 6.1-inch display, which is high in resolutions, 1440 x 3120 pixels to be precise. The display, on the top, contains a notch just like the iPhone X,  Vivo V9 ,  Oppo F7 , etc. The notch on the top can be also masked with the black patch as of now. We might be able to see some noteworthy ways to manage that ugly notch in the  Android P . And that won’t be impossible as the smartphone maker has already promised to manage Android P to its users when the new OS version is released.         The material used on the display is IPS LCD. Despite the use of IPS panel on the display, it is substantially bright with 1000 nits of brightness. With this display, LG G7 ThinQ is the brightest smartphone with the IPS LCD till date. LG boasted that the display possesses Red, Green, Blue and White pixels to improve enhance the display quality.  Powerful Performance  Powering the device is a Snapdragon 845 chipset. Previously, LG G6 had suffered quite significantly because of the use of the old processor. Now with a new and capable processor at play, LG G7 ThinQ can make strong impressions in the smartphone market. On the storage side, there are two variants: one with 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage whereas the premium one carries an ample 6GB RAM and 128 GB of onboard storage. The premium variant or the variant rich in memory is also remarked as the LG G7 plus ThinQ.  ThinQ Powered AI-Camera  G7 carries Dual 16 MP cameras at the back. Most of the flagship smartphones use the telephoto lens for the secondary sensor. However, LG had always been an exception and the trend continued here too. The secondary camera used on the G7 comprises of the wide-angle lens, which increases the field of view (FOV) while taking the images. With the dual cameras at play, users can squeeze in more content in the frame without a hassle. The camera setup on this smartphone helps the users capture images with up to 107-degrees of the field of view. And talking about the selfie camera, the smartphone is enriched with an 8MP sensor.  The cameras on the device are powered by LG’s home-baked AI platform, specifically used as ThinQ. These AI-powered intelligent cameras use onboard machine learning and recognize the objects in the frame. The camera brilliantly recognizes 18 categories of scene information on the G7: person, flower, pet, food, sunset, sunrise, landscape, city, baby, animal, beverage, fruit, sky, beach, snow, people, low-light and “basic.” It switches to what’s needed.   Dedicated AI Button  Just like the Samsung Galaxy S8, S9, and Note 8, LG has added a dedicated button on its device for the digital assistant. However, instead of putting its self-developed digital assistant like the Samsung smartphone, LG added the dedicated button for the Google assistant. Google Assistant is obviously the top digital assistant and a dedicated button to seek help from is obviously a bold move from LG. However, the sad part is that the button is not remappable.  A Booming Speaker  The G7 doesn’t have stereo speakers, just a single louder one. And it uses a weird new trick to amplify the sound. Cleverly, the Korean giant managed to turn the insides of the smartphone into a giant resonating chamber for its onboard speaker.\xa0With this technique, the G7 can produce up to 100 decibels of sound, which is three times more than the LG G6.  High-end Lossless Music Playback  LG has always been conscious about the audio quality in its smartphones. So it has kept the 32-bit quad-DAC\xa0from the G6 and V series alive in the G7. The company claimed that the quad-DAC will be able to provide a clearer sound for wired headphones. Probably this could be the reason for the LG G7 to include the 3.5mm headphone jack with the handset. The physical connector also allows LG to incorporate DTS:X virtual surround sound. This is the first time the technology, which virtually creates 7.1-channel audio, has been incorporated into a phone. However, the users need wired headphones or a speaker to get the full benefit of its object-oriented positional sound.

Looks like Samsung finally has gotten over their latest flagships and shifted their attention towards other smartphones. Samsung has launched the  Samsung Galaxy J7 Duo  as a member of their affordable J7 series.  This new mid-range smartphone from Samsung was officially unveiled in India a few days back and now it has been launched in Nepal too. The J7 Duo comes with a Super AMOLED display panel with HD resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio. It sounds very odd that smartphones still come with that traditional aspect ratio and an HD display at this price range makes no sense.         However, Samsung has included a dual rear camera of 13+5 MP that can now take portrait shots. The selfie camera is 8 MP snapper. All the three cameras feature f/1.9 aperture lenses.  The front camera also supports face unlock so that you can unlock your phone with just a quick glance.

['HP Pavilion 15 Review: The Ultrabook that Fails to Pack a Punch'],"['HP', 'Pavilion Series', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 29, 2018']",2018-04-29 15:12:36+00:00,"['Ultrabooks are getting common these days. They consist of great specifications all while being portable and powerful. The Pavilion-series from HP is among the popular laptops and the company has launched the 2018 edition of the Pavilion 15 with an updated 8th gen processor and a dedicated GPU. The specifications of this laptop look good on paper, but is it worth the 1 lakh price tag? Let’s find out.   HP Pavilion  15-CC187 Specifications:   Display:  15.6-inch full HD\xa0WLED-backlit, Touchscreen-enabled  CPU:  Intel Core i7-8550U 8th Gen processor  RAM:  16 GB DDR4-2400MHz  Graphics:  NVIDIA GeForce 940MX 4GB Graphics  Storage:  1 TB HDD  Operating System:  Windows 10  Weight:  4.2 pounds  Connectivity:  802.11ac, Bluetooth® 4.0 combo  Battery:  38 Wh Li-Ion  Price:  Rs. 100,000 (~ $1000)   Buy Here   Design and Build         The HP Pavilion 15 comes with a plastic body that flexes, and that too, a lot. The whole device is made of plastic but the top panel and the keyboard area has a brushed aluminum design which looks aesthetic. However, the build material feels cheap and even the slightest touch makes the top panel wobble. Now, I really like how the top panel can be opened with just one finger, but as a Dell XPS 13 user, I would really opt for sturdiness before anything else.  The bottom panel is also made of plastic and it has a certain degree of flex as well, but you might not notice it that much as this panel is made of good quality plastic. The “palm rest” and typing experience it provides is actually enjoyable.  With 18mm of thickness and nearly 2kgs of weight, you could say the Pavilion is fairly portable. Even though the device comes in a huge form factor, the inclusion of plastic body has made it lighter. Now the lightness is a positive aspect of the laptop but I wouldn’t mind an increase in the weight if it means getting a metallic body.  Keyboard and Trackpad   This is partly due to the keypads on the HP Pavilion 15. The ample key travel and the tactile keys make the typing a lot easier and fun. As a person who types in a lot of documents on their laptop, the keypads on the device has become one of my favorites. These keys are also backlit and have helped me quite a lot while using it in a darker area.  However, your laptop happens to house a glass trackpad, you will notice the difference in quality right away when you use the one on this device. The HP Pavilion 15 has a plastic trackpad that is made of a low-quality material. This trackpad isn’t that tactile and to sum up, using it is not that comfortable.  Ports   There are ample ports in the relatively thin body of the HP Pavilion 15. The bottom portion of the laptop is thick enough to house an ethernet port which I think is still necessary for a country like Nepal. There are few other ports as well such as the USB C port, two USB A port on either side of the device, an HDMI port, a full-size SD card slot and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Now, one thing I don’t understand is HP’s decision to include a DVD drive on their laptop. I mean who uses DVDs in 2018? I also think this decision has left the users with a smaller sized battery and a feature that will not be utilized at all.  Battery   This variant of the HP Pavilion 15 houses a 38 Wh battery. Yes, the battery is that small and you will be rushing to your charger every now and then. This laptop with its battery lasts for 2 and a half hours to 3 hours in total if you use it just to type in a few documents, watch a couple of videos and browse through the internet. Laptop companies are including a bigger battery in a smaller footprint these days, and I had expected this laptop to last for at least a few hours. The same goes for gaming, the laptop will only run for somewhere around an hour or even less if you are continuously gaming on it. This is partly due to the inclusion of a touch-sensitive display as well.  Display   The HP Pavilion sports a 15.6-inch full HD display with a WLED panel on top. This display is touch-enabled and it is responsive to every single touch, but I do always wish brands include a 360-degree hinge if they opt for a touchscreen on their laptop. The hinge that holds the display on this laptop is quite smooth and everything but I think it will wear off somewhere in the near future. Now, talking about the quality of the display, it can sometimes lack sharpness but it’s of a good quality with ample brightness and good color reproduction.  Performance   Under the hood, this laptop has the latest 8th gen 8550U intel core i7 processor with Nvidia 940MX DDR3 GPU. Although the 8th gen processor has significant improvements over its predecessor, the inclusion of 940MX is the area where I think HP has made a big mistake. For its price tag, HP should have gone with the MX150 or even gone higher with the 1050 GPU.  The review unit I received came with 16 GB of DDR4 RAM at 2400 MHz and I’ll start by talking about how this laptop performs the rather simpler tasks. My day to day usage constituted mostly of using MS Office, opening a few tabs on Chrome and listening to music. It does handle everything quite well, but it’s not a quiet device as the fan starts making noise even when I was not using any application sometimes. Yes, laptops do make noise but it is rather disappointing that it has to sweat a little bit to complete a few basic tasks.  I wrote this video script on the Pavilion itself, and the device started heating up a little bit after a while. The exhaust on the back gets warm to the touch and it heats up to more than 40-degree Celsius after a session of gaming.  Graphics  On to gaming, well I played a lot of FIFA 18 on the device and it was smooth on medium settings but if you ever happen you max out the settings, you will experience lag after several minutes. The frame rates drop, and the sound becomes way too muffled and distorted. Keep in mind I am talking about FIFA here and there are a lot of other games that require quite a bit of graphics to run without stutters.  Hardware   HP has included the famous Bang & Olufsen dual speakers on the HP Pavilion 15. The device is certainly among the more pleasing sounding speakers but I would have liked it if they were a bit louder.  One the storage side of things, there is no SSD included on the device, so you will have to work with the 1 TB Hard Drive on board. Although there is ample storage, with the Hard drive you will experience the slight lag while loading up applications and while transferring files. There’s, however, an option to add SSD with the M.2 Slot inside this laptop.  Conclusion  As a Dell XPS 13 user, I have to say I missed my laptop at the time of this review.\xa0 So for $1000 or 1lakh rupees that you’re paying for the Hp Pavilion 15, you are getting a good display, a tactile keyboard, and a portable form factor. But you’re compromising a lot with the older GPU, low build quality and a below-par battery life which has made this device neither a gaming laptop nor a reliable ultrabook. So, if you are in search of a laptop maybe you should just skip this one and get a better value for money device by adding a couple of bucks.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hp-pavilion-15-review.jpg']

['Gionee S11 Lite Review: An Underachiever'],"['Android', 'Gionee', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 26, 2018']",2018-04-26 07:32:28+00:00,"['For a couple of years now, smartphone companies have shifted their focus to the mid-range segment where we are getting to see new launches of some promising smartphones every other day. Each of these smartphones claims to excel at something they house. And that is exactly what the  Gionee S11 Lite  is doing. Launched a while back for the price of Rs. 26,000, the device claims to pack in a lot of features, with its camera being the USP. So, is this smartphone capable of leaving a mark in the nearly-saturated mid-range market? Let’s find out in this review.   Gionee S11 Lite Specifications:   Display: \xa05.7 inches IPS LCD HD+ FullView display with 18:9 aspect ratio  OS: \xa0Android v7.1 Nougat with Amigo 5.0 UI  Chipset:\xa0 Qualcomm Snapdragon 430  CPU:  Octa-core up to 1.4GHz  GPU:\xa0 Adreno 505  RAM: \xa04GB  Internal Storage: \xa032GB, Expandable up to 256 GB  Front camera: \xa016MP, f/2.0 aperture  Rear camera: \xa013MP + 2MP, f/2.2 aperture, autofocus, LED flash  Rear-mounted  Fingerprint Scanner  Battery: \xa03030 mAh Non-removable battery   Design and Build         Let’s start with the design and build. One of the highlights of Gionee S11 Lite is its stunning design. I mean just look at that shiny back. Gionee sure has nailed the looks of the device. However, the back is prone to attract fingerprints, and that too a lot. So, a case is a must. And while using and the material on the back flexes sometimes. This is solely due to the plastic material this smartphone is covered in. For what it’s worth, I think it should have been cloaked in a metallic back. The volume rockers and the power button are easily felt and it is tactile, but here too, the plastic material tends to feel cheaper sometimes. And Gionee, if you really had to opt for plastic, you could have at least included a sturdy one! To sum up, even though this smartphone looks attractive, it surely doesn’t feel like one. Just take a look at the competitions, almost all the smartphones of its price range have a premium feel with the metallic back they house.  Display   Up top, there is a 5.7-inch display that comes in with an 18:9 aspect ratio. This is a plus for someone looking for a trendy smartphone, although the decreased bezels are still not that minimal. This display has HD resolution, and you can experience the lack of sharpness and saturation, something that you can find in a full HD panel. Take the competition, for example, smartphones like the Xiaomi Mi A1 and Huawei Y9 2018 are cheaper than the S11 Lite but feature a crispier 1080p panel. We are currently at a time when the mid-range smartphones are nailing almost all the aspects of a mobile phone, and then Gionee comes with a device that is worth Rs. 26,000, and sports an HD panel. That sure is disappointing. However, the display is bright enough, and it does well in the bright light setting. Plus, I really like the inclusion of the ‘Smart eye protection’ mode which helps to filter out blue light to protect from visual fatigue. You can adjust the setting of the smart eye mode as per your desire.b  Hardware   The Gionee S11 lite comes with 32 GB of onboard memory which can be expanded up to 256 GB via a microSD card slot. Now, although there’s an option to expand the memory, I still think for the price of Rs. 25,999, smartphone companies must be including 64 GB of memory now, this has become a necessity now!  I had previously complained about the speaker quality of the M7 Power in my review, and I kind of faced the same issue with the S11 Lite. The bottom firing speaker gets muffled sometimes and it doesn’t get that loud as well.  On the back sits a fingerprint scanner that is easily reachable and handy. The Gionee S11 Lite has one of the fastest fingerprint scanners I have seen on a smartphone. Yes, it is that fast. The unlocking is quick, and you can count on it at all times. And this scanner also helps to unlock applications, and capture pictures with ease.  Performance and Software   Moving on to the performance, it is quite unimpressive that Gionee has opted for the chipset which we usually see in smartphones worth 14000 – 15000. But the performance has been satisfactory, at least for me. It handles my day-to-day usage which includes a bit of gaming, internet browsing and running a lot of applications. Yes, there are stutters sometimes, but it handles the necessities of an average user. This may be partly due to the device not having to power a high-resolution display. Oh, and It tends to warm up only a little bit after a long session of gaming and heavy usage.   Gionee M7 Power Antutu Benchmark  Infogram  On the benchmark side of things, the Gionee S11 Lite is one of the average smartphones in the market. Again, comparing it with some of the other mid-range smartphones, you can see differences in the benchmark scores.   As for the software, this device runs on Android Nougat and an iOS-like Amigo UI.\xa0 It comes equipped with a lot of bloatware which for me Is quite unnecessary, although some of the extra features like the battery manager and the app lock are quite useful. But if you are someone who wants the Operating system of their smartphones updated, you might want to look somewhere else as Gionee isn’t known that much for updating its phones’ software.  Camera   Gionee has boasted the camera setup of the S11 lite which includes a 16 MP selfie camera. It also offers Group selfie and faces beauty. The pictures are clear and vibrant but I did notice these grains on the selfies, as you can see from the images. The selfies sure look great but there is that unusual effect on the images.   The rear houses a dual camera of 13MP and 2 MP. The “normal” shots from the camera are decent, I have to say. But they lack saturation and that “pop” which make the pictures look great. In low light, there is a loss of detail, and that loss is kind of huge. The camera also attracts lots of noise. So, using this device for the night time is a no-go for me.             This rear camera offers Bokeh mode as well. The bokeh mode was sure fun to use as the intensity of the blur can also be adjusted. However, the device struggles to identify the subject and blur the background effectively.             In the first shot, the flower petals weren’t identified whereas in the second one, the cameras did suffer a lot although it produced images such as the last one where the device only struggled to blur out the parts of the girl’s hair.  Connectivity   The Gionee S11 Lite comes with a dual hybrid SIM slot that houses a nano SIM and provides another option to add either a microSD or a nano SIM. The call quality from the phone was good and the people on the other side never really complained about the sound. However, with most Nepali people using dual SIM cards, the choice they have to make between a SIM card and an SD card is kind of tough, to say the least. So, if any smartphone company is reading this review, people do not include a hybrid SIM slot.  Battery   The Gionee S11 Lite houses a 3,030 mAh battery. It doesn’t support any form of fast charging which is a bummer as it took me over 2 and a half hours to fully charge the battery. Under heavy usage, it gave me a screen-on-time of around 5 hours. And talking about its stand-by time, well, it’s kind of weird. Once, I slept with around 25% of battery left on board, but when I woke up the next day, the phone was dead. However, other times, it can certainly last for a longer time.  Conclusion  The Gionee S11 Lite is an interesting smartphone looking to leave a mark in the Nepali market. The device has a good camera and an intriguing design, that can attract anyone on the first glance. However, Gionee has cut corners in a few areas, and they are the areas where competitors are offering a lot more for the price! The competition now is sure tough and Gionee, with the S11 Lite, has struggled to live up to that mark.  If the Gionee S11 Lite isn’t really your cup of tea, you might be interested in some its competitors like the  Xiaomi Mi A1 ,  Coolpad Cool Play 6 ,  Galaxy J7 Pro , or  Huawei Nova 2i .

It packs 294ppi resulting in crisp and sharp images. The phone comes with a plastic housing so it’s light and handy. Despite the plastic build, the phone feels premium on the hand. Since the phone was one of the top-tier choices under 15k last year, it totally crushes the segment of under 10k.        Powering the phone is the Snapdragon 425 64-bit chipset clocked at 1.4GHz, coupled with 2GB of RAM. With the new MIUI 9 update, the device fly through all the run of the mill tasks that you throw at it. Resource heavy apps like Facebook and Instagram open up quickly. But there is a slight delay when you are switching between apps while multitasking. But it’s not something big and one can totally cope up with it. Gaming can be considered good as well since it can easily handle midtier titles on the play store.   Since there are two storage variants of the Redmi 4A – 16GB and 32GB, the offer mentioned here is for the 16GB model only. If you feel 16GB is inadequate for your needs then you can pop in a microSD card up to 256GB. Talking about slots, the phone carries a hybrid Nano SIM tray.  Talking about cameras, the phone sport a 13MP camera on the rear with PDAF and 5MP on the front. For what it’s worth, the rear camera on the device is surprisingly good with good details and natural colors. The selfie, however, could have been a bit better. Backing up the phone is a decent 3120mAh battery which can easily provide 4 to 5 hours of screen on time.  As additional features, the phone offers IR blaster and wireless FM. But the lack of fingerprint sensor is definitely a bummer for this device. But despite its shortcomings, the Redmi 4A is one of the best phones you can buy under 10k.

And for the rest of us who don’t live in China, the phone is known as Xiaomi Mi A2. And yes, it’s the successor of last year’s beloved pure Android based  Xiaomi Mi A1 . The new smartphone is expected to offer better performance, even better camera and an even more better value for money. All we can do is hope the Mi A2 comes in the same Android One based operating system.  Xiaomi is confident at the device, claiming it will outperform the likes of  Oppo R15  and even the  iPhone X . So, what can you expect from such a hyped smartphone? For starter the camera are supposed to be deliver really good performance. The main sensor includes a 12MP Sony IMX486 alongside a 20MP IMX376 sensor. The front will also share the same 20MP IMX 376 from the back for selfies, along with flash on both fronts.  The camera does come with AI enhancements, with over 200 scenes and 12 different portrait modes. Xiaomi also claims the smartphone will learn over time to provide even better details, face detection, gestures and edge bluing capacity. The secondary camera will do 4 to 1 pixel binning delivering better low light shots, same as on  OnePlus 5T  and Oppo R15.        The performance also takes a huge leap, from a mediocre Snapdragon 625 to a  Snapdragon 660 . Pair that with either a 128GB/6GB, 64GB/6GB or a 64GB/4GB storage and RAM options, and that’s about as good a $250 smartphone gets. Oh, did we mention the smartphone starts at $250.  The storage is expandable, however it does use the SIM 2 slot. The rest of the spec sheet include USB C port, Bluetooth 5.0, Quick Charge 3.0, dual-band ac WiFi, Gorilla Glass 3 protection and the removal of headphone jack.  But what trumps it all is the pricing, that will start at $250, it does seem like a bargain. The smartphone comes with Android 8.1 out of the box, based on the Android One platform.

['Understanding Gyro sensor or Gyroscope'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 21, 2018']",2018-04-21 08:45:24+00:00,"['Nowadays, smartphones have procured many hardware components, which have made them a powerful device. Going through the specs, we are often perplexed with the features it includes and the sensors inbuilt in it. Having many sensors on your device is good as it makes your multifunctional in many respects. However, to be able for the optimum utilization of your smartphone, you must have a sound knowledge of the sensors. One of such sensors, which often keep us bewildered, is Gyro sensor or Gyroscope.  What is Gyro sensor or Gyroscope?  Gyro sensor is one of the types of a motion sensor. Motion sensors are the sensors, which senses the movements, such as tilt, shake, rotation, or swing. Gyro sensors are the type of sensors used to sense the angular rate or angular velocity. Gyro sensors can sense rotational motion and changes in orientation and therefore augment motion. Vibration gyro sensors can sense angular velocity due to the Coriolis force applied to a vibrating element. This motion produces a potential difference from which angular velocity is sensed. The angular velocity results in an electrical signal output.        How it differs with an Accelerometer?  The main difference of Gyroscope with the Accelerometer is that an Accelerometer does not sense the rotation, however, a Gyro sensor does.  An accelerometer is a compact device capable of measuring non-gravitational acceleration. When a stationary device comes into motion, the Accelerometer feels the vibrations. The accelerometer\xa0is designed to respond to the vibrations associated with such movement. However, a gyro sensor is a device that uses Earth’s gravity to determine orientation.  An accelerometer is capable of determining the\xa0changes in velocity and\xa0changes in position. However, a gyro sensor measures either\xa0change in orientation\xa0or\xa0changes in rotational velocity.  What are the uses of Gyro sensor in your phone?  Having a Gyro sensor on your device serves the following privileges:   With a different set of motion of your device, you will be able to assign different task to your device.

['Huawei Honor 10 unveiled: Kirin 970 and AI cameras are to look for'],['Huawei'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['April 21, 2018']",2018-04-21 02:31:17+00:00,"['Much read and said about the notch on smartphone displays, the smartphone manufacturers have not yet stopped introducing the smartphones with a notch. This time, honor joins the league. The sub-brand of Huawei unveiled the Honor 10.  The Honor 10 comes with a near bezel-less display i.e. 19:9 aspect ratio which is the case in most of the smartphones having notch these days. The smartphone stands 5.84-inches tall. It is a pretty decent size for a smartphone with 19:9 aspect ratio. The outlook of the smartphone is time and again being compared to the  Huawei P20 . However, it is said to have youthful look in comparison.  At the launch event, representatives of Honor said that the smartphone was designed or ‘crafted’ with much focus on aesthetics. The Honor 10 has an IPS LCD panel with full HD+ display (1080 X 2280px). While talking about the outlook, the back is coated with aurora coated panel which is a color shifting. This is one thing that we are really looking forward to.         The smartphone carries dual rear cameras on the left placed horizontally and the fingerprint sensor is placed right below the screen.  One of the fascinating aspects of the Honor 10 is its chipset. The Kirin 970 is said to be the one for flagship smartphones and is Huawei’s own product. The SoC introduced on the Q4 of 2017 also has AI (Artificial Intelligence) capabilities. It has a dedicated Neutral Processing Unit. It has proved out to be worth it through various benchmarks as well.  Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group said, “The Kirin 970 is the first in a series of new advances that will bring powerful AI features to our devices and take them beyond the competition.”  Furthermore,  the Honor 10 has 6GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. But, it disappoints us big time that it doesn’t consist of a Micro SD card. It has a 128GB variant as well, that means we will not miss on much. But the flexibility that a Micro SD card slot brings in terms of storage will be missed.  The Honor 10 runs on Android Oreo 8.1 which most of the smartphones on 2018 are running on.  While talking of the camera, there is a color sensor camera and a monochrome sensor camera on the Honor 10. The color sensor one has 16MP whereas the monochrome sensor is of 21MP.  The Honor 10 has a 24MP selfie camera which is capable of taking iPhone X like the portrait is what they claim. On the video part. The main camera is capable of shooting 4K while the selfie camera can shoot 1080p.  Moving on, the Honor 10 follows the league of smartphones that dissed the 3.5mm headphone jack this year. On the brighter aspect, it has a USB type-C port which means the fast charging game would be strong also, it packs a 3,400 mAh battery.  Huawei Honor 10 Launch Date & Price:  The Honor 10 is similar to Huawei P20 in many aspects but the smartphone’s specifications are quite promising. It comes in\xa0Black, Blue and Purple colors and is priced at US$ 412 for 64GB storage version and US$ 477 for the 128GB. You can order the phone starting from today till April 26th if you are in China.\xa0The launch and its availability in Nepal has not been revealed yet.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/honor-10-launched.jpg']
['Samsung Galaxy S9 Review: Class Glass'],"['Android', 'Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 20, 2018']",2018-04-20 14:32:18+00:00,"['2017 was a great year for smartphones. However, almost all the smartphones were so feature packed that a question always reeled in people’s minds, What next for smartphones? At a time when these four words begged for an answer, Samsung came up with the Galaxy S9 and S9+. I have used these smartphones for almost one month now, and here’s my full review.   Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ Specifications:   Display : 5.8/6.2 inches Super AMOLED WQHD+ (1440 x 2960 pixels) with Gorilla glass 5 (front and back) protection, 18.5:9 aspect ratio  Chipset:  Exynos 9810  OS :  Android Oreo  with Experience 9 UI on the top  RAM : 4/6 GB  Storage : 64 internal storage, 128 GB (only for Samsung Galaxy S9+) Expandable up to 256GB (Uses SIM2 slot)  Rear Camera (Galaxy S9) : 12MP, f/1.5 – f/2.4, Dual Pixel PDAF, OIS, LED flash  Rear Camera (Galaxy S9+):  Dual: 12 MP (f/1.5-2.4, Dual Pixel PDAF) + 12MP (f/2.4, AF), OIS, phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, LED flash  Front Camera : 8 MP, f/1.7  Connectivity : Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac,  Bluetooth 5.0 , A-GPS, 3G, 4G LTE, USB Type C 3.1 reversible connector  Sensors : Iris scanner, fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, heart rate, SpO2  Battery:  3000/3500 mAh non-removable battery, with Fast Charging (QC 2.0)  Features : Intelligent Scan, AR Emojis, IP68 Certified (Water and Dust resistant), Wireless Fast charging  Price : Rs. 87,900 (4GB/64GB) / Rs. 99,900 (6GB/64GB) / Rs. 104,900 (6G /128GB Galaxy S9+)    Design         Even with notches picking up the pace this year, Samsung has opted to stay traditional with the Galaxy S9 and S9+. The bezels are now short, and the top bezel now holds all the sensors and the front-facing camera. Even though smartphones with notches might provide a little bit extra screen space, although minimum, I still like Samsung’s decision regarding the bezels. And talking about the side bezels, there are none! The display of the devices is curved on the sides to blend with the aluminum frame which in turn merges with the glass back. Oh, and the IP68 Dust and Water resistance is certainly a major plus if you want to take your smartphone for a dip sometimes. Design wise, I must give full marks to Samsung as the company has yet again come up with a sleek and premium device that is worth every penny you pay.  Display   One of the major differences between the Galaxy S9 and S9+ is their form factor. The Galaxy S9 comes with a 5.8-inch display while the plus variant has a 6.2-inch screen. However, both the displays have a Super AMOLED panel with WQHD+ resolution. And talking about the quality of the display, well let’s just say the Samsung’s flagships have the best display in the business right now, period! You will especially notice the superiority while viewing high-quality videos. It has ample vibrancy with rich saturation and details to go along. And the minimal bezels certainly help the cause. There are only a handful of flagships currently available in Nepal right now, and the S9 could house the best display on any smartphone for months to come.  Performance   The internal hardware of the devices too have gotten a revamp with the new octa-core Exynos 9810 chipset that now has a 30% performance boost, and that is seen while using the smartphones as well. The Galaxy S9 with its 4 GB RAM and the Galaxy S9+ with its 6 GB RAM can handle all your multitasking needs without dropping a sweat. Gaming is a fun experience on these devices as you can expect a lag-free performance at all time. However, after long sessions of gaming, navigating through the internet and using the camera, they tend to get warm at times.   Samsung Galaxy S9 Geekbench Score Comparison  Infogram  If the benchmark scores are taken into account, the Galaxy S9 and S9+ are certainly the champs. They are the highest rated smartphones on Antutu and the Single-core and multi-core score on Geekbench is top-notch.   Samsung Galaxy S9 Antutu Score  Infogram  \xa0  Samsung still has a lot to do with Apple’s A-series chipset, though, as the iPhone X certainly outperforms the S9 and S9+ and that is also seen in benchmark results.  Also Read:  iPhone X Long Term Review  Software   On the software side, the devices come run on Android 8.0 Oreo with Experience UI on top. The software on the devices is easy to use as Experience UI has certainly evolved to become lighter and lag-free over the years. However, there are still dual applications that are meant for the same purpose. Now you can indeed remove some of the applications like Samsung gear or voice recorder, but there are lots of other applications which are just eating up space on the devices. It would have been very appreciable if Samsung gave it’s users this freedom!  Camera   One of the major differences between the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ is certainly the camera. While the S8 and S8+ had the same camera setup on the back and front, the Galaxy S9 and S9+ are somewhat different. The former device has a single camera on the rear side while the latter has dual cameras. However, the only time you will miss dual cameras on the S9 is while taking pictures on the Live Focus mode, aka Portrait mode.   The Live Focus mode does a well enough job to blur out the background, but there is still work to be done as it still isn’t on  iPhone X ’s Portrait Mode level as you can see from this comparison shot. Samsung has included a unique feature which lets users change the amount of blur before or after taking the image, which is certainly useful.  One similarity both the phones hold is the camera with a changeable aperture. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ now come with a camera that can try to adapt to its surrounding. The f/1.5 aperture takes in lots of light for better low-light pictures while the f/2.4 aperture takes sharp pictures. Now, this feature might really be the next big thing on smartphones where smartphones casually widen or narrow their apertures, but as a “normal” user, I didn’t notice that much of a difference. Yes, the pictures are sharper during night time from the f/2.4 aperture, but will you notice a huge difference? Not really!  Let’s compare the camera the S9+ with the iPhone X, which is its direct competitor as other flagships like the  Google Pixel 2 ,  LG V30  and  Huawei P20 Pro  have not made their way in Nepal.   One thing I noticed during the comparison was that the images from the S9+ have a slight pinkish tint to them. This is seen in images with a white object and more clearly on some night-time shots. The iPhone’s samples meanwhile have a warmer tone. Now, apart from the exposure level that iPhone’s camera can hold, I think the S9+ holds a little edge in every other aspect. Yes, the images from the Galaxy S9+ is a bit oversaturated sometimes, but it captures a lot of details which I viewed when I zoomed into the images.   And the night light shone better on the Samsung flagship as there were more details on s9+ with proper noise control and exposure level. However, the pinkish tint that I talked about before was clearly visible in some of the night shots.   I took this picture at dusk and the whole image came out with a lot of pinkish tints. Now this tone can help amplify the colors if the object is reddish or, say, maroon, but with white on focus, you might get a different result sometimes.   One area where Samsung hasn’t really upgraded is the front-facing camera. At a time when almost all the smartphones are focusing on selfies, Samsung has apparently chosen to stay with what it has. The selfies are of good quality in daylight, but under low light, the images are quite muddy and lack sharpness.   Here are some other samples from the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+:                         In terms of video quality the smartphone stabilizes the videos well in full HD setting, it captures ample details and the colors pop out nicely as well. However, the field of view slightly decreases when you toggle the video capture button. Under low-light, the videos definitely live up to the flagship tag, but it has a touch of noise here and there. The slow-motion and super slow motion videos are a whole another story so I will be talking about them later.  AR Emoji   The front-facing camera now supports Samsung’s own AR Emoji which is its answer to Apple’s Animoji. Although emoji-flying yourself sound fun, the AR Emoji feature is quite raw and unfinished, and I noticed this right after I used it. The device couldn’t read what I was doing with the emoji not emulating my expressions. Hopefully, Samsung will listen to its customers, just like it has listened to this time around by placing the fingerprint scanner below the camera setup.  960fps Slow Motion  Samsung has boasted its slow-motion feature that captures videos at 960fps in HD quality. At first, I really enjoyed using this feature as it nailed slowing down the shots, but then I realized how the videos lacked quality. They lack saturation, sharpness, and details, and you won’t like what it produces at night light. Toggling on the super slow-mo tab, you will realize how the smartphone decreases the exposure exponentially. This same issue is also seen on 240fps slow-mo which reduces the exposure by a level. Also, the slow-mo videos slow down for just around 2 seconds which is a lot less time.  Hardware  This time around, Samsung has included dual speakers (one on the bottom and another being the earpiece itself) on their flagship which are now AKG tuned. Well, as compared to Samsung’s previous flagships, the dual speakers have certainly gotten better. However, if we compare the sound with the iPhone X, the Apple flagship sounds better. The dual stereo speakers are a plus, but with AKG also working together, I had expected something better.  This time, the Samsung flagships have combined facial recognition with Iris Scanning technology for security purpose. While this sounds interesting, this feature can’t really unlock the smartphones in a jiffy like a fingerprint scanner. The fingerprint scanner, which has been engraved in the right place this time, is adaptive and the unlock is faster than the Intelligent Scan. The fingerprint sensor on the S9 is easily reachable and isn’t placed awkwardly and it unlocks the phone in an instant. However, the animation takes a bit of time, so you might feel a little lag while comparing it against, say, the Oneplus 5 or 5T.  Battery   The other area where the S9+ edges out the S9 are in the battery department as it has a 3,500 mAh battery against the 3,000 mAh of the S9. Since the Note 7 debacle, Samsung has always tried to stay on the safer side and this time too, it’s not different. Backing up a tall WQHD+ display is not easy and that is clearly seen in the battery life as the Galaxy S9 provides around 3.5-4 hours of screen time while the S9+ gives around 4.5-5 hours. For a flagship smartphone worth a fortune, I have to say the battery number do not do enough justice. In terms of charging time, with Quick Charge enabled, the Galaxy S9+ takes around 1 hour 30 minutes to charge the device whereas the S9 takes a little less time. I was really hoping Samsung would include a long-lasting battery on the Galaxy S9 and S9+ but the company has compromised on that front.  Insurance  Now there is a reason why I am drawn towards the S9 and that is the insurance Samsung is currently providing on its smartphone. The build of the Galaxy S9 has made the phone quite slippery, and I did happen to drop it hard on the display once. I had thought the display repair was free with the 1-year breakage insurance, but I did end up paying Rs. 6000 for the display which would generally cost a huge amount of money. So, kudos to Samsung for the insurance campaign.  Special Feature   The S9 also has the basic flagship features such as the heart rate, stress, and oxygen saturation. These features could be useful for someone who is into monitoring their day-to-day health stats while some might even feel that these components are taking up space where Samsung could have included a bigger sized battery!  Conclusion  So, my final words for the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ would be that these are the best options for flagship devices in Nepal right now. Yes, the iPhone X is a direct competitor but is a little bit expensive, the  Mate 10 Pro  is has begun to lose its charm and the Huawei P20 Pro is yet launch here. So, even if you are not a Samsung fan, you only have the iPhone X as a choice. But considering the good performance, the insurance facility, the top-notch display and the camera, I see the Samsung Galaxy S9 or the S9+ as the finest options for Android flagships in Nepal.

Since its commencement of the smartphone business in Nepal, we have been hearing about the Chinese smartphone brand time and often. This is partly because of their focus on the midrange segment and also because of their ability to provide good specs in a budget range. Whatever be the reason, the brand Huawei, is prominent among us Nepalese.  If we turn the pages of the past, Huawei made its name in the Nepali market with a smartphone called  Honor Holly , which was priced at Rs.13,500. Similarly, over the years Huawei has introduced notable phones like the  Huawei G Play Mini ,  GR5 2016 ,  GR5 2017 , etc.  The year 2017 marked the launch of Huawei Nova 2i, which was Nepal’s first phone to feature a quad camera setup and a display with 18:9 aspect ratio. This midrange smartphone turned out to be the talk of the town, as it created a sensation in the Nepali smartphone industry. Now, after 4 months, Huawei officials claim that the Huawei Nova 2i is Huawei’s best selling smartphone in Nepal with the company selling 50,000 units of the device till date.        “The sales of 50, 000 units of Nova 2i in just 4 months is a result of company’s hard work. This is a matter of joy and pride to the company. And we are thankful for the people to have liked our product so much”, said one of the Huawei officials.  The marketing effort Huawei has devoted to the Nova 2i is quite commendable. We see banners and advertisements for the device almost everywhere we go. Along with good specifications, the company’s promotional strategies are one the major reasons for Huawei to make it to this point.   In 2018, Huawei has brought impressive smartphones like  Huawei P20 and P20 Pro . The mid-range segment is also getting a boost with the  Huawei Y9 2018 , which is considered to be an affordable version of the Nova 2i. However, these devices have just launched, so what their performance will be like is yet to be known!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Huawei-Nova-2i-best-selling-nepal.jpg']
['Sony Xperia XZ2 premium announced with 4K HDR display and impressive dual cameras'],"['Sony', 'Sony Xperia']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['April 17, 2018']",2018-04-17 16:22:32+00:00,"['Sony is a Japanese electronics company which has a strong hold on the global market. one of the products of this global electronic giant is smartphones. Sony was one of the first cellphone manufacturers that came up with unique designs and a better camera quality. Its XZ series is still a go-to among the flagships.  This year’s MWC  witnessed various top-notch inventions and  Sony Xperia XZ2  was one of the many that really caught our attention. Not much after that Sony has announced the Xperia XZ2 premium. Is it really ‘premium’? Let’s find out.  Design  The Sony Xperia XZ2 premium comes with a design what Sony calls as an Ambient Flow.\xa0 Incorporating the Ambient Flow design language, XZ2 Premium possesses a curved body, a metal frame, and a 3D glass back, with Gorilla Glass 5 used both on the front and back. The glass body coated with corning gorilla glass 5 has definitely given a premium look to the handset. In addition, the Gorilla glass 5 plays a vital role in offering a better resistance to the cracks and scratches during the falls. Despite the introduction of a new design language in the smartphone community, the smartphone still looks a bit outdated for a 2018 phone. We can tell Sony could’ve done a better job in its design department.        Display  The Xperia XZ2 premium stands 5.8-inches tall. It has a very impressive 4K (3840×2160) Triluminos HDR IPS LCD with a 16:9 aspect ratio. With the 4K display, the phone packs 760 pixels in every inch offering a remarkable sharpness. Sony has also claimed that the XZ2 premium is 11% taller and 30% brighter than its predecessor, the  Sony Xperia XZ Premium . It also features Sony’s BRAVIA technology, X-Reality for mobile, to up-convert content to near HDR for a “more cinematic contrast, color, and clarity.” The phone can capture 4K HDR video. This feature has made the XZ2 premium the only smartphone that can both capture and view a 4K HDR video.  Camera  The camera part is said to be the biggest upgrade this time around. The smartphone comes with  dual rear cameras  placed horizontally and the fingerprint sensor placed right below the camera. It has a monochrome camera sensor and the other is the color camera sensor.   The primary rear camera with the color sensor is 19 MP. It is made of Sony’s ‘award-winning’ G lens. It is called the motion eye camera as when the camera shifts to low-light the size of the pixels increase. This also captures 3 other frames except for the picture clicked.\xa0Whereas on the secondary rear camera is of 12MP and this also consists of G lens. The point of having a monochrome camera is for the sharper contrast of black and white. The selfie camera has a 13 MP lens and Sony claims this is one of the fields which it has worked on upgrading.  The AUBE signal processor combines the data from both the sensors to make the pictures look better in the low-light as well. This smartphone from Sony will also have a bokeh effect.\xa0Sony states that detail from both sensors is then processed by the AUBE fusion ISP in real time, which enables ISO 12800 for videos and ISO 51200 for photos. According to the company, the ultrasensitivity with “clean, noise-less images” was previously only possible in interchangeable lens cameras. The live viewfinder is said to be a bright and accurate one as well.  As far as the video is concerned, the lens on the XZ2 premium shoots super slo-mo HD and Full HD videos up to 960 fps. This has been possible because of the memory stacked image sensor.\xa0The Motion Eye dual camera on the phone can also pull out Bokeh effects for defocused backgrounds. Furthermore, users can also take monochrome pictures with “smooth gradation between black and white.”   Moving on from the camera portion, the Xperia XZ2 premium is powered by the powerful  Snapdragon 845 processor  which is one of the reasons we can assume that the smartphone will have a smooth processing. Android Oreo is the Operating system the Xperia XZ2 plus.  It has 6GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage with impressive 400 GB of expandable storage. It consists of 3,540 mAh of the battery which seems pretty average considering the 4K display. We wish Sony had considered a bigger battery for elongated battery life.  The smartphone is IP65/68 certified and this makes it water and dust resistant. The Xperia XZ2 Premium supports USB type-C charger for the fast charging. It also supports wireless charging and along with it comes the dock charger. However, the smartphone has 3.5mm headphone jack missing.  The smartphone will be available in two color variants i.e. chrome black and chrome silver. The phone will be priced above $850 if rumors are to be believed.  Sony has come up with nice specifications but these are certainly not out of the box.

['Xiaomi Black Shark launched: An ultimate Gaming smartphone from Xiaomi'],['Xiaomi'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 14, 2018']",2018-04-13 19:53:05+00:00,"['When observing and analyzing the current trend of the smartphone in the market, it can be seen that the majority of the brands are racing to provide the best product for photography. Undoubtedly the latest examples would be the  Huawei P20 Pro ,  Samsung Galaxy S9 plus , and the  iPhone X . With the passage of time and the progression of hardware and software, the smartphone these days also have been a great device to perform multitasking and using intensive graphics applications. However, the smartphone makers have been quite reluctant to bring the handset entirely dedicated to gaming. When Razer launched the  Razer Phone , it broke all such tradition. Now, following the footsteps of the Razer, Xiaomi launched the Xiaomi Black Sharks Gaming smartphone in China.  Design  Beginning with the dimension, the Xiaomi Black shark gaming phone measures 161.6 x 75.4 x 9.25mm. And the smartphone audaciously weighs 190 grams. When the smartphone manufacturers are focusing on bringing slim and light handsets, the weight and thickness might be unpleasing. But since it is a gaming smartphone, the device construction definitely follows a different formula.  When the device is looked at the front, nothing seems different when compared with the regular smartphone. But when the handset is turned over, a new gaming energy awakens. The design like a sports car at the back generates awe and differs the Black Shark from the crowd. The backside of the phone also incorporates the horizontally aligned pair of cameras and an ‘S’ logo at an absolute middle.         The true gaming sensation awakens when the detachable gamepad controller is embedded to the device. \xa0The controller looks like a typical Joystick in a small form factor. There is also a dedicated Shark Key at the left side of the phone, which allows the users to access the impressive gaming zone.  Display  At the time when there is an immense craze for the smartphones that boasts the 18:9 aspect ratio, Xiaomi has not taken a risk. The smartphone valiantly boasts Full HD+ display with the trendy 18:9 aspect ratio. The display on this gaming device also embraces the DCI-P3 color gamut. And the most important of all, MEMC intelligent motion compensation technology has been injected into the phone, which ensures smooth video quality while playing games.  There is nothing much to talk about the bezels since a generous amount of bezels still present on the phone. But since it is a gaming phone, that’s understandable. The presence of the front mounted fingerprint sensor, which lies meticulously on the home button differs the handset from the typical Xiaomi smartphones.  Performance  This gaming smartphone enjoys the Qualcomm’s latest flagship, the  Snapdragon 845 chipset . In terms of memory, the Black Shark gaming smartphone comes in two variants. The light variant possesses 6GB RAM accompanied by 64GB of internal memory whereas the higher-end variant has the delights of 8GB RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. And to cheer and excite the crowd, the CEO of Black Shark mentioned that the smartphone scored a whopping 279,464 on AnTuTu. So we can expect that this gaming will definitely not shred a single drop of sweat even while playing the graphics-intensive games.  In the gaming devices, heating issues often come to nudge the users while playing games. And to address the issue and to control the internal temperature, this gaming device features a multi-layer cooling system that includes high thermal conductivity copper alloy substrate, Nano-composite graphite, heat pipe and liquid cooling that can bring down the temperature of the device by 8 degrees by improving the CPU cooling efficiency by 20 times.   Since the gaming devices devour a huge amount of power, it is uncool to own one of such kind of device, which needs charging in quick succession. So to evade such problems, the smartphone maker has included a remarkable 4000mAh battery. This gigantic battery promises to deliver the power up to 5 hours even if the “King of Glory” is played continuously. In addition to its capability to fuel a significant amount of power during the gaming sessions, the phone also supports Quick Charge 3.0. With the ability of the smartphone to draw 18W power, charging process would not be a hassle.  Software  Xiaomi does not forget to inject its handsets with its home-baked MIUI. However, in the Xiaomi Black Shark Gaming Smartphone, the smartphone maker has sprinkled the JOY UI. There is nothing much to get excited about the new UI as it is a customized Android Oreo ROM that includes the core features of the MIUI. The tweaks on the MIUI are entirely focused to improve the gaming experience in the handset.  Cameras  The users’ choice definitely goes to the smartphone, which is great in every department. So keeping that on the mind, Xiaomi has furnished the smartphone with the capable components even in the camera department. For an impressive photography experience, it includes a dual camera setup at the back. The rear camera pair at the back incorporates a primary 12MP camera backed by the secondary camera of 20MP. The primary rear camera has an aperture of f/1.75 and includes the sensor with the pixel size of 1.25 micron. The secondary camera also shares the same size of the aperture (f/1.75) with the pixel size of 1.0 micron. Equipped with the 6P dual camera setup at the back, the smartphone looks capable of taking some nifty shots with ambient details and some awe-inspiring portraits.  Up front, there is a single camera of 20MP dedicated for the selfies. The front camera enjoys the f/2.2 aperture and 5P lens. The selfie shooter also offers features like intelligent beauty mode and 4K video recording at 30fps. Both the cameras on the device are powered by an independent image processor by Pixelworks.  Shark GamePad and Connectivity  The Black Shark gaming smartphone imitates a pure gaming device when its Bluetooth-enabled Shark GamePad to the top portion of the phone. The shark GamePad is packed with a Joystick, \xa0a trigger, and a 340mAh battery. With this battery, the controller runs continuously up to 30 hours. Since it gets paired via Bluetooth, it can also be used to play games on every other smartphone that support Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.4 and above.   Talking about the connectivity, the Black Shark gaming smartphone features Dual SIM support, USB Type-C, Wi-Fi ac,  Bluetooth 5.0 , 4G VoLTE, GPS, AGPS, GLONASS, etc. Enriched with so much of connectivity options, the smartphone maker has employed X-shaped smart antenna design to avoid the signal connectivity issues when used in any configuration (vertically or horizontally).  Furthermore, this gaming handset is favored with Hi-Fi audio, Biso stereo speakers with Dual smart PA for amplified audio output. With this audio setup, the gaming sound enthralls the users with an immersive gaming experience.  Xiaomi Black Shark Price and availability  In terms of pricing, the Xiaomi Black Shark smartphone is tagged with the price of 2,999 Yuan, which equals $477 for the 6GB + 64GB variant. The premium or the higher-end variant with 8GB + 128GB is priced at 3,499 Yuan, which equals $557. And the Joystick like Shark GamePad controller can be availed at 179 Yuan ($29). The smartphone is available in two color variants: Night Black and sky Gray.  At the pre-mentioned prices, the smartphone is available for pre-booking in China. Xiaomi is also offering a free Shark GamePad for the first 50,000 pre-bookers. A smartphone enriched with so much of impressive features is obviously tempting to the most of the gamers. However, the global availability of the smartphone has not been announced yet. So the smartphone probably will not launch in Nepal. But as of China, the smartphone maker has promised to make the device available from April 20.  The Big Question  When Xiaomi launched the MI Mix as the concept phone, it was hailed all over in the tech community. After the unveiling of the Xiaomi MI Mix, a new trend started in the smartphone world on bringing and developing the concept of smartphones with a bezel-less display. Alike this incidence, when the Razer launched its Razer gaming smartphone, the device maker garnered a substantial amount of applauds and encouragement. Now as the Xiaomi seconded this bold move, can we expect that a new trend to begin in the smartphone world regarding the gaming phones?

This journey obviously has not been a long one. However, with HMD Global by its side, Nokia is getting back on the track. The galore of appraisals for the handsets and the frequent news about the  Nokia smartphones being sold in minutes  is simply mind-blowing. Lately, when Nokia showcased itself with its latest smartphones in the  MWC 2018 , the remarks from the tech crowds was unforgettable. The same smartphones, which made the headlines during the MWC 2018 is now available in Nepal. The three Nokia smartphones, which made its way to Nepal to excite the Nepalese tech enthusiasts with its sublime design and specifications are  Nokia 1 ,  Nokia 6 2018 , and  Nokia 7 Plus .  Also Read:  Nokia Smartphones Price in Nepal  Nokia 1  It is always a person’s dream to carry a smartphone packed with numerous useful features and also looks and feels premium on the hold. Such smartphones, however, comes at an expense of a stack of cash and not every people can afford it. Targeting such customers in the market, Nokia 1 serves to delight the people with its impeccable features at a budget-friendly price.        With the sturdy build, Nokia 1 justifies the goodwill earned by Nokia over the years. The 4.5-inch screen on the device is a decent size on a budget smartphone. At this size, the handset is easy to hold and use even with a single hand.  This least expensive Nokia smartphone is gifted with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. The presence of 1GB of RAM might seem displeasing these days. However, this handset is one of the privileged ones to boast the light or Go version of Android OS. With the Android Go OS on its system, the apps and internal processes inside the device are optimized so the device does not suffer lags and stutters on the use.  On the camera side, the handset sports 5MP sensor on the back and 2MP on the front. Fueled by a 2150 mAh battery, Nokia 1 costs Rs. 9,325 on the purchase.

The smartphone also made headlines on more than one occasion for being sold in less than a minute time. Nokia 6 2018 is the successor to the same smartphone, which refueled the hopes of Nokia to regain its glory back after the downfall.  Boasting a 5.5-inch Full-HD display, the Nokia 6 2018 comes with shielded with the Gorilla Glass 3 on the top. Looking at the display size and protection system used, the handset does not seem to make any changes. But if both handsets are kept side by side, it can be seen that the newbie possesses smaller bezels as compared to its predecessor.  Last year’s Nokia 6 was powered with Snapdragon 430 chipset, which used to disappoint its users with the excessive heating and stuttering processing during when assigned to heavy workloads. However, in the new model, the chipset is replaced by  Snapdragon 630 chipset . With this new chipset, the smartphone has the potential to outperform the mid-range fan favorite smartphones like  Xiaomi MI A1 ,  Vivo V9 ,  Redmi 5 Plus , etc. And the presence of bloatware free stock version of Android provides a strong suit to the device to unleash its potential.  Despite the trend of dual cameras, Nokia had to be adamant about providing a similar setup on Nokia 6 2018. So just a single sensor of 16MP resides on the back. The Carl Zeiss lens is used on its rear camera. Carl Zeiss is a renowned name in the camera industry. So we can expect some astonishing shots from the device. Up front, there is 8MP camera dedicated for the selfies.   Nokia 6 2018 Vs.

It did suffer some blips in the middle, but still we have a soft side to the company because most of us probably started the mobile phone journey with an old Nokia device.  The new Nokia by HMD Global made its way into Nepal last year, and the company received a warm response. This year, Paramount Electronics is back at it as the authorized distributor of Nokia smartphones in Nepal is set to launch three new smartphones, namely the Nokia 1, the Nokia 6 (2018) and the Nokia 7 plus.  Don’t Miss:   Nokia Mobiles Price in Nepal        Nokia 1   Nokia has always had the budgets under its pocket except for some exceptions. The  Nokia 1  is a phone that runs on Android Go – the minimalistic Android. This device runs on the latest Android Oreo from Google and supports the Google Assistant. Nokia also claims that they’ll update the device to Android P and Android Q in the near future.  With Android Go, users can download apps up to 10MB for maintaining the lightness in the software department. The Nokia 1 has a 4.5-inch tall screen with an HD IPS display which is a great deal for the price it is being offered at.  The smartphone runs on MediaTek MT6737M SoC and a quad-core processor. It consists of 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage with 128 GB of expandable memory.  According to our sources, the Nokia 1 will come approximately at a price of Rs. 10,000 and will be available in the second week of April.  Nokia 6 (2018)    Nokia is certainly planning to take a leap in the budget price segment this year and the company has Nokia 6 to spearhead that leap. The  Nokia 6 (2018)  is the successor to one of last year’s headline maker – the  Nokia 6 . This year’s edition runs on Android v8.0 Oreo. There are two storage variants available in the international market right now – 3/32 GB and 4/64 GB variants. It is quite unclear right now if Paramount will launch both 3 GB and 4 GB RAM options in Nepal or not.  The Nokia 6 (2018) houses a 16MP camera on its rear part and an 8MP lens on the front. The device is powered by an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor. It consists of dual SIM slots and a 3000mAh non-removable battery. The Nokia 6 comes with a 5.50-inch IPS LCD display will a full HD resolution.  This powerful midrange smartphone will approximately cost around Rs.25,000 – 30,000 and it will be launching on the 3rd week of April.  Nokia 7 plus   Next in line is the Nokia 7 plus. This device has a trendy looking 6-inch full HD display that comes in an 18:9 form factor. The Nokia 7 plus comes with 4GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage with an option to expand up to 256 GB.  The smartphone houses an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 process underneath the hood. According to Qualcomm, “ Snapdragon 660 offers up to 30% higher graphics performance and twice the LTE and Wi-Fi downlink speed compared to the prior generation.”  The battery life of the Nokia 7 plus is quite promising with the 3800 mAh battery in place. But hey, we have indeed counted on Nokia in this department in the past.  The 7 plus will be launched in Nepal on the 4th week of April. This midrange flagship is assumed to cost around Rs. 45,000 – 50,000 approximately.

They\xa0have already refreshed the  XPS 15 with new 8th gen processors  and better GPU. With that out of the way, the Alienware and Inspiron Gaming series are also getting an overhaul. With performance boost claims of up to\xa050%, let’s take a look at all of what Dell has to offer.  The new G series will replace the previous  Inspiron gaming series , featuring three new laptops, the G3, G5 and G7. These new laptops will fit almost all laptop buyers in almost every price range. All three laptops come with either a GTX 1050 4GB, GTX 1050Ti 4GB or a Max Q GTX 1060 6GB . They also come equipped\xa0with a 56Whr battery and up to a maximum of 32GB RAM at 2666MHz.

Availability starts from 3rd April and will be priced at $749 for the 15 inch and $799 for the 17-inch variant. You might ask yourself why the low prices? Well according to the Verge, that is all thanks to a cheap plastic build and even worst keyboards and touchpads.  The G5 (15″) also comes with either a 4 core i5-8300H or a 6 core i7-8750H. The noticeable\xa0improvements over the G3 is an optional 15″ 4K UHD matte IPS display. The G5 also gets a 2×2 802.11ac wifi. Dimension wise, it has a\xa00.98 x 15.32 x 10.82-inch body, with a weight of around 2.65kg. The laptop will also be available starting April 3, with a base price of $799.

Sadly, the GPU options remain the same.  The G7 is available in both FHD and UHD resolution matte IPS panels. Dell has managed to cram all this into a\xa00.98 x 15.32 x 10.82-inch body. The laptop will be available starting April 3 for a starting price of $849.  Storage options for all three models include an M.2 SSD from 128GB to 512GB and a 2.5-inch HDD from 500GB to 1TB.

['Acer Predator 15 G9 Review: A Cool Machine'],['Reviews'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['April 5, 2018']",2018-04-05 10:19:24+00:00,"['Gaming laptops  are great until they heat up and start to throttle. This is still one of the main reasons why people get desktop for high-performance gaming. But what about those who admire portability, are there no hopes left? Well, that’s when the Acer Predator 15 G9 caught our attention, in all of its glory.  Yes, it’s thick and bulky and even makes gaming laptops like Dell Inspiron and MSI’s Apache offering looks light and portable. But, the Predator\xa015 is capable of artefact the MSIs and Dells of the world just can’t, and that’s proper cooling. So, let’s check this beast and find out if the Predator justifies the Rs.178,000 price tag it carries.   Buy Link  Build and Design  Let’s start off with the elephant in the room because this is the elephant of all laptops. It’s hands down the biggest laptop I’ve ever tested, and it’s only 15” and yet, it has a weight of 3.4Kgs. And that’s a lot when you carrying it around with you all day. But that is one and the only quirk about this laptop, because it’s all good stuff from here on out.         The laptop itself is very sturdy and well built. There is a very aggressive vibe to it with the sharp edges and RGB lighting on most parts. It’s a plastic body with rubberized finish and feels pretty durable for the most part. But on the downside, it easily retains dust particles and oil stains.   Display  The display on this laptop is ok for the most part. It’s a 15” display with a resolution of 1920*1080 at 60Hz. It covers about 84% of the SRGB and 55% of the Adobe RGB color spectrum. That is on par with the MSI GE62 we previously tested, so not the best display for all the color-intensive\xa0workers out there.   The brightness also caps out at around 270nits, which isn’t bad, but not any better than other gaming laptops that we have tested.  Performance  The performance follows the same story as every other gaming laptop we have tested till now. The i7-7700HQ performs the same as others out there. It is a 45 watt Quad Core CPU with speeds of up to 3.8GHz. The RAM department is handled by a 2400MHz single channel 16GB, so no complains there as well.   Also, if you ever want to, there is an extra RAM slot free and ready for a new RAM.\xa0The laptop was very snappy, responsive and adequately powerful with no slowdowns whatsoever. There were also no bottlenecks and multitasking was a breeze. In general, the laptop performs well, and if you ever need it, RAM upgrade is just a screw away.  Graphics  The graphics power was as powerful as any other laptop GTX 1060 out there. This laptop comes with 6GB of DDR5 graphics memory, and it is pretty powerful, to begin with. How powerful you ask? Well, optimized triple-A titles run pretty well, with above 60 frames per second.  And that is good and all, but let’s look at the numbers, and we mean real numbers. We did test a lot of games, but here are 5 games which we ran on maximum or high settings with steady frame rates.  \ufeff \ufeff  Thermals  Coming to the best part about the laptop, which is the thermals. The laptop has two fans, which work pretty well on their own. But they are aided by this other fan which is removable, and Acer calls it the PREDATOR FROSTCORE. It’s designed and made by CoolerMaster which helps with keeping the CPU and GPU temperatures at the minimum.  For the real-life thermal performance,\xa0I played PUBG for 4 Hours continuous and the laptop didn’t even break a sweat, it barely got warm to the touch. I played at 1080p high settings the whole time and the frame rates didn’t drop below 60 once. Just for comparison, the 7577 started to seriously throttle after just 3 hours and by the time I was at my 4 th \xa0continuous hour, the game was almost unplayable.  I basically never managed to throttle the laptop, no matter how hard I tried. Even with tiresome benchmarks, heavy gaming marathons and videos renders, I failed to heat up the laptop. It did get really loud, but if a loud laptop is what you pay for a cool laptop, it’s not really a bad deal. A pair of headphones will do the trick as well.  The back of the laptop is equipped with these huge exhaust vents that throw out some of the hottest air from a laptop. This does, in turn, keeps your laptop cool but will very well irritate anyone sitting in front of your laptop. There is also an option to run the fans at maximum speeds for even better cooling at all time.  Storage  This laptop can fit a total of 3 storage devices, two SSDs and a full-size 2.5″ laptop hard disk. The SSD on this laptop is on the slower side, but it gets the job done. With read and write speeds of 500mbps and 300mbps, it will definitely be better than a traditional hard drive but nothing special. Basic tasks are snappy, although game loading time does take a hit.\xa0A 1TB hard disk is present for storage, and there is always the option to add another SSD to the empty slot.  Keyboard and Trackpad  It has chicklet keys which is one of the best I’ve seen on a laptop. They have a very satisfying key travel alongside four zonal backlit that can be controlled by a software. You also get 5 macro keys, each can be individually configured. Then there is another key to change the preset of the macro keys giving you, technically a total of 15 configurable keys. It also has a big power button, giving it a real gaming vibe.   The trackpad is also fine on the most part. It has separate right and left buttons, alongside a dedicated trackpad on/off button, really handy when playing games or just writing a novel. The trackpad is made up of plastic but none the less, it’s pretty accurate and doesn’t feel cheap at all.  Battery  We have established that this laptop is huge. And with it comes in a huge area to fit a huge battery. Asus did exactly the same, a 90,000-MWh battery is something you don’t usually see on a laptop, it’s barely under the legal flight limits. Thanks to the same battery, you get about 5 hours of normal usage, which is actually a lot considering it’s a gaming laptop. If you plan to game on battery, about 2 hours is what you should expect at most. Just keep in mind you don’t have access to the Turbo mode on battery.  Connectivity  The Killer WIFI goes very well with the Killer Ethernet, resulting in you killing all of the lags out of your online gaming sessions. Port selection includes an Ethernet port, Display port, HDMI, 2 USB 3.0 and a Thunderbolt 3.0 port on the right. On the left, you get another two USB 3.0 port, SD Card reader, 2 audio jacks and the power port.  Other than that, the laptop comes with a wide selection of pre-built software, which will help you get the best out of the hardware. Predator Sense is one of the most useful apps in there. It lets you switch between Normal, Faster and Turbo mode (only available in AC mode).  Acer DustDefender is another app that reverses the system fans which Asus says will prevent dust build up. The Acer care center is another app that lets you take care of your system even better. And lastly, the Acer Quick Access which lets you turn on the Cool Boost, Dust defender, Bluelight Shield among a few options.  The laptop comes with a G Sync sticker below the keyboard, which got me really excited. Sadly, the inbuilt display doesn’t actually support G Sync, so you need an external G Sync capable monitor for it. I was disappointed at first, and a G Sync display would have made this laptop an actual value for money, it wasn’t by any means a deal breaker.  Conclusion  So, for the price of Rs 1,80,000, Acer has put a lot on the table for this laptop. The sturdy build and edgy design is something that really grabs your attention, not to mention such a solid hardware configuration that guarantees utmost gaming performance along with one of the best cooling system out there. Certainly sounds like a solid deal right? Well, if you plan on using it for the sole purpose of gaming, and don’t mind the bad portability, then a definite yes. There are a few other laptops like the  Alienware 15  with a 120Hz display or the extremely portable Razer Blade 14, so it definitely depends on what you want.       \xa0 Pros    Cons     \xa0Performance  \xa0Heavy    \xa0Battery Life  \xa0Thick    \xa0Build Quality  \xa0Tad bit expensive    \xa0Thermals  \xa0G-Sync only for external monitor']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Acer-Predator-15-Review.jpg']

['Dell XPS 15 9560 with GTX 1050 GPU and 4K Display launched in Nepal'],['Dell'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['April 4, 2018']",2018-04-03 21:12:48+00:00,"['When you search for a laptop with high-end performance, the XPS series from Dell is the unmissable name. XPS (Extreme Performance System), the name says it all. So, lately, if you have been searching for a good laptop with enticing ergonomics and top-tier players in terms of performance then just be happy! We have good news for you. Neoteric, the authorized seller of Dell Laptops in Nepal has recently brought the beautiful and high-end performer, the Dell XPS 15 9560 in Nepal, albeit at an exorbitant price.  Dell XPS 15 9560 Overview  Also Read:  Dell Laptops Price in Nepal  The XPS 15 comes with the aluminum base and lids. The presence of the aluminum has not only made the ultrabook all-alluring but has also increased the durability. In its already sleek and thin design, the presence of the display extending edge-to-edge framed with narrow bezels is highly remarkable. Additionally, the glossy display on the device uses Sharp’s signature IGZO panel for very wide colors and extreme clarity with negligible graininess. With this premium display, the Core characteristics like backlight brightness, contrast, and color space remain almost unchanged. This vivid display is also gifted with a maximum brightness of 350 nits, which is really impressive.        The trackpad, carbon fiber palm rests, and black plastic keys all look attractive when the lid is opened. However, on the use, they all attract fingerprints and get grease quite easily. Talking about the webcam, the infamous webcam placement on the lower bezel will continue to nag most of its users.  The  ultrabook  comes in two notable configurations; one with Intel Core i5 processor and another with the Intel Core i7 variant. Both 7 th  generation processors are coupled with the remarkable GTX 1050 graphics card. With these components on the device, the laptop performs like a breeze even while playing high-end games or multi-tasking with the numerous applications. Talking about the memory, the base model comes with the 8GB of DDR4 RAM while the premium model enjoys the ample 16GB RAM. Nonetheless, the memory on both the variants can be expanded up to 32GB.  Specifications   Display : 15.6 inch Full HD non-touch/4K-touch (3840 x 2160 pixels) InfinityEdge  Processor : 7th Generation Intel® Core™ i5-7300HQ or i7-7700HQ Quad Core  Memory : 8/16GB DDR4 2400MHz; up to 32GB (additional memory sold separately)  Video Card : NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX\xa01050 with 4GB GDDR5  Storage : up to 1TB HDD  Audio and Speakers : Stereo Speaker, Dual Microphones, High Definition Audio with Waves MaxxAudio® Pro  Wireless connectivity : 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1  Battery : 56Whr built-in battery  A/C Adapter : 130 Watts (19.5 V, 6.67 A)  Camera : Widescreen HD (720p) webcam with dual array digital microphones  Ports : 2 x USB 3.0 with PowerShare, USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 with power delivery, HDMI, Headphone/microphone combo jack, Memory card reader   Dell XPS 15 9560 Price in Nepal  The XPS 15 laptop is undoubtedly one of the  best ultrabooks  in the market. Along with the stunning build and design, the high-performing components on the system get all the attention. So to call this laptop a beast may not be an exaggeration. However, while buying a laptop, the price is also a major thing that comes to the play while buying from the authorized seller (Neo Store). And the XPS 15 is priced brutally at Rs. 2,45,900 for the i5 variant whereas the i7 variant carries a price of a whopping Rs. 3,12,990. Such a whopping price from the authorized seller is obviously diverting since the other grey sellers are offering at much cheaper rates.  ITTI is selling the i5 variant of Dell XPS 15 9560 with Full HD panel at Rs. 1,38,000. Similarly, the i7 variants are available in two formats at ITTI. Dell XPS 15 with an i7 processor, 4K display, and 16GB RAM is priced at Rs. 2,20,000, whereas the variant with an i7 processor, Full HD display, and 16GB RAM costs Rs. 1,85,000.

['Samsung Galaxy A8+ Review: Almost Flagship'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['April 3, 2018']",2018-04-03 14:05:00+00:00,"['Samsung’s A series has always been in the middle of the J series and the S series with flagship grade design but average hardware specification. The newly launched  Galaxy A8 Plus  is here to change that with the inclusion of the 18:9 display and 6GB of RAM. However, it comes with a hefty price tag of Rs.60,000. But we all know that this is the price territory where the OnePlus has been so dominant? So let’s find out if the A8 Plus can give the  OnePlus  run for its money.   Samsung Galaxy A8 Plus 2018 Specifications   Display : 6.0 inches Super AMOLED (1080 x 2220) @411ppi, Always ON Display  OS : Android 7.1.1 Nougat  Chipset : Exynos 7885 Octa  CPU: \xa0Octa-core (2×2.2 GHz Cortex-A73 & 6×1.6 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU: \xa0Mali-G71  RAM : 6GB  ROM: \xa064GB extendable up to 256 GB (Dedicated Slot)  Rear camera : 16 MP, f/1.7, phase detection autofocus, LED flash  Selfie- camera : Dual: 16 MP + 8 MP, f/1.9, 1080p  Connectivity : Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by), WIFI b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, USB Type C  Sensors : Fingerprint sensor (rear- mounted), Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, Compass, Ambient light.  Battery : Non-removable Li-Ion 3500 mAh with fast charging support  Additional Features : IP68 Certified (Water and dust resistant), supports Samsung’s Gear VR  Colors : Black and Gold   Design         The phone on the first glance would easily fool anyone thinking it’s the  Galaxy S9 . And why wouldn’t it? It has got the same camera and fingerprint placement and the curved Gorilla Glass 4 back makes you think it really is. I wouldn’t hesitate to call it the S9 Lite!  Although, without the curved sides on the display it won’t quite feel like the same as S9. Upon holding the device, it is nothing short than using a high-end Samsung device or any other flagship for that matter. Not just beauty, but the phone doesn’t miss out on essentials like the IP68 water and dust resistance.  Display   One of the standing features of the phone is its tall 6-inch 18.5:9 aspect ratio display with full HD+ resolution. Upfront it almost looks like the new S8’s or the S9’s if the top and bottom bezels weren’t that big.  Being super AMOLED, the blacks are deep and contrasts are high. You will instantly love the display with its punchy color and how fine everything looks in it.\xa0Viewing angles are great while playing games and watching movies and under direct sunlight, the display can get bright up to a healthy 590 nits for proper visibility. It is definitely no less than the display on flagship phones.  If you dive into the settings you can change display temperature and other variables to tune the display. But in my use, I had no issues watching photos and videos with the default settings.  Also, the display detects apps that are in 16:9 ratio to convert into 18:9 without any app crashes or visual errors. The addition of Blue light filter is an essential touch and I wish every phone had this feature.  Performance   Unlike last year’s A-series, this year’s A8+ has a fairly powerful 7885 octa-core chipset with powerful cortex a73 cores to deliver better performance compared to last year’s 7880 with Cortex A53s. For day to day tasks, it feels fast and you won’t run into any issues.  But as you load more apps in the background, there are few noticeable hiccups like the scrolling becomes a bit jittery and app switching with double click on the recent tab becomes slow. App openings are fairly fast and the 6GB of RAM onboard keeps plenty of them in the background without having to reopen them. Although Experience UI is pretty minimal for its own good, I feel it is still responsible for the jittery scroll effect and slow app switching.   Coming to the gaming performance, the Mali G71 GPU can very well handle all the mid-tier titles on the play store. But when it comes to the high-end games, the GPU fails to deliver enough power which resulted in sluggish animation on the Asphalt 8 but the Modern Combat 5 was playable.  If performance is what you are after, then paying Rs. 60,000 could get the OnePlus 5T or the  Xiaomi Mi6 (available for just Rs. 44,000 on Limited Deal)   which comes with the powerful Snapdragon 835 chipset which can very well crush all the high-end games you throw at it, even the new PUBG for mobile at the highest settings.  We put both the phones (A8 Plus and 5T) through Antutu, Geekbench, and Basemark and every time the OnePlus5 outnumbered the score of A8+ by miles which also resulted in the same in real life usage.  Software :   The A8+ is running on Android 7.1.1 with a promised Oreo update on the pipeline. Samsung has promised to keep up with the regular android security patches so it will be getting scheduled Security updates on Android.  With Experience UI 8.5 has every feature that you get on the Samsung’s flagship like the S8’s. It has got Face Unlock\xa0 – although kind of slow, always on display for a quick glance at time and notifications, wallpaper and theme store, along with that cool on-screen navigation buttons. The inbuilt secure folder comes really handy that allowed to safely keep my data.   There are tiny bits of features here and there that enhances the usability even further. Like scrolling on fingerprint sensor to bring the quick toggles and notification center, gaming mode to restrict notifications while gaming, one-handed mode, cache cleaner and so on.  Camera:   The camera is always the most looked upon feature of the Samsung phones. And the 16MP f/1.7 camera does a good job to hold on to your expectation. It comes with phase detection autofocus but no optical image stabilization. The images it produces has a pretty good sharpness and saturation which is typical of Samsung. It offers a decent dynamic range which often brought details in the shadows. You typically won’t need to turn on the HDR mode because of this and plus the option is hidden inside the settings.  The phone does come with Pro mode but it’s an overstatement to think of it as something extraordinary as it only provides options for exposure, ISO, and white balance. It clearly lacks manual focus and shutter speed which I would have to love to have.  With wide f/1.7 aperture, it performed well on low lighted conditions. The images certainly had some grains but the details are certainly there. But the inclusion of OIS would have improved the night photography to some extent.  We put the A8+’s camera to the test against the OnePlus 5. When compared side by side, the images produced by A8 has better highlights as the objects are lit well. And typical of Samsung the subjects are well saturated but when it came to details I found the OnePlus 5 preserved more details in the images. OnePlus tends to boost of the red highlights more while the A8+ saturated the overall image in a balanced manner.        1  of 4                                                          When it comes to videos, it can shoot full HD at 30fps but has no 4k recording. The video comes out with good details, contrast and is very clear.   Coming to the front with the dual 16MP+8MP camera, I had very high expectations with the secondary wide-angle lens. But upon using it – it has very less field of view than what I would normally call a wide-angle.\xa0 The wide-angle camera is surely a disappointment on this device.   Although the images are commendable at good lighting conditions with adequate details, colors, and sharpness. Although when the beauty mode is turned off the image processing tends to smoothen the skin a bit.      Normal Mode     Beauty Mode   \xa0  Not to forget the dual lens offers live Focus Mode which will shoot bokeh images. The edge detection around the head is particularly good but other areas remain without blur or the blur moves into the subject itself. It is a hit or miss feature but when it works you definitely get quality images.   Overall you will shoot plenty sharp photos with all the three cameras on this phone without any complaints whatsoever.  Battery :  The Samsung A8+ comes packing a 3500mAh battery which provides around 5 hours of screen ON time on average that will easily last you a day of moderate usage.   The plus side on the battery front is, it comes with adaptive fast charging which will charge the device up to 40% within 30 minutes and full charge within 1 and a half hours.  Connectivity   Coming to connectivity, it offers dual Nano SIM slots and both offer excellent network strength. When it comes to calling quality, the earpiece was loud enough to produce clear sound and I had no problems making calls even in a crowded environment.   Talking about audio, the loudspeaker mounted on the right side is loud and the audio is crisp for listening to music and while playing games.   Also, the audio output from the 3.5mm headphone jack is one of the best in this price segment. It produces one of the cleanest audio through headphones with no audio distortion and every other aspect like the bass, treble, and the mids are balanced well.  It offers Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band ac wifi, and USB C for charging and data syncing.  Verdict   In conclusion, the Galaxy A8+ is a Samsung flagship wannabe that that almost made it – if it wasn’t for its price. For 60k you get an amazing design, sharp and vibrant display, neat audio experience, good cameras and a day-long battery life, but where A8+ was outclassed by its competitors was with the performance. If you are not a heavy gamer, the A8+ is a good buy, but with the same price, you can get the OnePlus 5T that offers better processor, faster software updates, and slightly better camera performance.  Also if you have few extra cash to spare, you should definitely think about getting the S8 or even the S9.

The Vivo V9 is the successor of the Vivo V7 (Rs. 29,990) and is priced at Rs. 37,790. The phone is available for purchase all over Nepal starting April 2, 2018.  Latest Price: Rs. 34, 640 [Price Last Updated on July 27, 2019]         Overview:  The Vivo V9 offers a big 6.3-inch display with a tall 19:9 aspect ratio and Full HD+ resolution. With\xa0the ‘near’ bezel-less display, Vivo has managed to keep the screen to body ratio at a staggering 90%. However, there is a notch in the front making it the first Android smartphone in Nepal to have so. It looks similar to the  iPhone X  from the front.   The similarity extends with the Software too. Although the V9 is an Android smartphone running the latest Oreo 8.1 version, but with Vivo’s custom Funtouch 4.0 OS layered on top, everything from icons to interface looks inspired from Apple’s iOS. [socialpoll id=”2495656″] The Vivo V9 is a lightweight phone (150g) – thanks to its plastic back. The build is ordinary and the use of a glass or metal body would have been a better choice. There are two color options: Pearl black and gold and both are a fingerprint magnet. Despite featuring a plastic body, the phone feels great in hands thanks to the sides that curve towards the edges. The display is protected by a gorilla glass 3 and a 2.5D curved glass.   In terms of performance, Vivo V9 is powered by a Snapdragon 626 SoC. It is based on 14nm architecture and has 8 Cortex A53 64 bit cores running at 2.2Ghz. You can expect the performance to be similar to the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus and better than the OPPO F5, Huawei Nova 2i, and Galaxy J7 Pro.  There’s 4GB of DDR3 RAM and 64GB of storage. You can expand the storage via a dedicated microSD card slot up to 256GB. Connectivity option include Dual SIM with 4G VoLTE, WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS. The battery is sealed in and has a capacity of 3260mAh. It is rated to provide 5 hours of onscreen time which translates to a day of moderate usage. It lacks fast charging support and takes roughly around 2.5 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.  Also Read:  Vivo Mobiles Price in Nepal  The feature highlight of the phone is the camera. The 24MP front camera is now AI-powered. Vivo claims its AI face beauty mode is trained using a comprehensive database of million face images which allows detecting the age, sex, skin texture and skin tone of the subject and lighting environment.  The back houses a 16MP primary camera and a 5MP secondary camera for depth sensing (bokeh effect). There’s an LED flash on the back.

['Dell Inspiron 7577 Full Review'],"['Dell', 'Reviews']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['March 30, 2018']",2018-03-30 15:49:49+00:00,"['Dell has been updating their Inspiron 7000 gaming series 3 years in a row now. And this year is no different, thanks to Nvidia’s Max Q design, Dell has managed to fit a GTX 1060 alongside a 7th gen Intel quad-core processor, a really fast SSD and a Thunderbolt 3 port on its latest Dell 7577 gaming laptop.  If you are in the gaming laptop market with a budget of around Rs.150,000, this laptop offers amazing specs which seem to be Dell’s ongoing trend as well. Since we are talking about a gaming laptop, let’s start off with its GPU.         Graphics  Previously the Dell 7567 offered the 1050 TI that delivered ample horsepower to run AAA titles smoothly. The latest in 7000 series, the Dell 7577 sports the GTX 1060 with Max-Q design that provides 30% more power than the 1050Ti.  This laptop basically crushes it in the 1080p segment. The GTX 1060 MAX-Q clocked at 1063Mhz with 1280 CUDA cores takes care of the high-end gaming needs along with 6GB of GDDR5 RAM. Putting these numbers into context, it can do 60fps in any game you throw at it either in Ultra or high settings and in some pretty rare cases, medium too.  The Max Q design does affect your performance. For instance, the desktop 1060 will give you 118fps in final fantasy XV on low settings. Under the same configurations, the GTX 1060 laptop variant will deliver around 110fps. Now compare them with the GTX 1060 MAX Q design and you will get around 73 fps. It’s still a healthy upgrade over the 1050Ti, but not as good as the regular 1060s out there.  If you are worried how much the MaxQ design affects your performance, we have a graph below to illustrate just that with FPS counts of Final Fantasy on low setting on each GPU system.   And then here is the fps count of the top 5 games we tried out on the Dell 7577   Thermals  With more power comes more heat and the GTX 1060 on this relatively compact laptop does just that. The laptop heats up a lot more, a lot faster.\xa0  After 3 hours of continuous PUBG, the laptop throttle a lot with fps dropping below the 40fps playable mark even at the lowest settings. The same thing repeated with all the other games I tested as well.  Build and Design  The laptop features a sturdy build with sharp edges and is reasonably heavy. Put them into numbers, you get a 2.7kg laptop with a thickness less than an inch. The MAX Q design also helped with the thickness a lot.  The design itself is identical to the Dell 7567. As a gaming laptop, portability won’t be an issue if you manage to get a bag big enough. The laptop will not fit on your average 15″ laptop bag or a protective case for that matter. Basically, the laptop features a 15.6″ inch display with the footprints of an average 17″ laptop.  Performance  The laptop runs on a 45-watt Quad Core i7 7700HQ processor that can reach speeds of up to 3.8GHz. The RAM is handled by a 2400mHz single channel 16GB stick. At the time of its release, this is the best configuration one could hope to find in its respective price range.   The laptop was snappy, responsive and seems to do everything you throw at it. Basic multitasking was a breeze, I did try multitasking while gaming as\xa0well, and got mixed results. All in all, the laptop was one of the best performers out there.  Display  The IPS panel is identical to it predecessor, with 71% of sRGB and 53% of Adobe RGB color coverage. It’s a pretty good IPS panel if you ask me, just not the one for those who do color intensive work (Photoshop, Lightroom, After effects). Other than that the display has a wide viewing angle and non-reflective matte finish.  The max brightness of just 250 nits might seem low but you just cannot complain. It is a 1080p 60Hz panel, which goes very well with the laptop’s specifications. There’s a 4K version of this laptop with better color accuracy but unfortunately, it’s not available in Nepal. So, overall the display is decent for gamers, but if you are a content creator, it’s not the laptop for you.  Storage  Storage is where the laptop shines. The Dell 7577 laptop features a really good SSD with read and write speeds of 2812Mbps and 1293Mbps respectively. Just for comparison, it’s predecessor Dell 7567 featured an SSD with speeds of 500Mbps down and 300Mbps up.   Numbers aside, the SSD will fail to show any difference in basic tasks. However, games load a lot faster and file transfers are a breeze. The SSD this laptop features is\xa0one of the fastest we have seen in its price range. It also has a 1TB 5400RPM hard disk for cheaper storage.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The keyboard is good but will need some getting used to. The laptop features a very minimalistic keyboard with no extra programmable keys, to begin with. First timers might even have trouble using it, thanks to its low key travel and a cheap feeling when you press hard. The good thing here is it offers\xa0literally no flex resulting in a durable and long-lasting feeling.  The trackpad is ok, but it’s made out of cheap plastic, although I must say it offers good tracking and gestures that work perfectly. Dell did opt for windows precision drivers, which is how I feel every laptop should come with, in the first place.  Battery  The 75Whr battery on the 7567 has shrunken down to a 56Whr capacity, which will be one of the biggest disappointments of all. I got an average of around 3 hours of battery life versus the 5 and a half hours on its predecessor.  It is a gaming laptop, so most people might not care much about the battery. But given that its sibling puts out almost 6 hours of battery life on a single charge, the 3 hours just seems disappointing. Also, if you want to game on battery, expect about an hour or less.  Connectivity   Ports selection remains one of the most satisfactory aspec of the Dell 7577. It consists of almost every port you could think of. On the left are a memory card slot, a USB 3.0 port, Ethernet, and a charger port. On the right is an audio port, a pair of USB 3.0, an HDMI port and finally a USB 3.1 Type C port with Thunderbolt 3 support with 4 lanes of PCI-E meaning you can connect external GPU to get maximum bandwidth. Not like you really need it but it’s there for some extra boost. There is also the usual Intel dual-band Wi-Fi ac and Bluetooth 4.2 for connectivity which works well, as expected.   Buy Link  Conclusion  So, for the price, you get a quad-core i7 processor, 16GB of DDR 4 RAM, a very fast SSD, a good IPS display, and a very capable GTX 1060 with MAX Q design. The question is, is it the best laptop for gaming under 150k? Probably Yes.  Dell Inspiron 7577 Pros:   Built  Performance  Fast SSD  Connectivity   Dell Inspiron 7577 Cons:   Display  Battery   Alternatives  Its\xa0competitors include Lenovo Y720, the MSI GE 62VR 7RF, and the Helios 300 with all of them sharing almost identical specs on paper. But the Lenovo Y720 and MSI Ge62VR are a bit on the expensive side and the Helios 300 compromises on a few features but manages to stay the cheapest of the bunch. However, if you are on a tight budget, you can opt for the Dell 7567 and not miss out on much.

It produces varieties of gadgets and  iPad  is one of Apple’s most prized possessions. Apple has recently launched the successor of its cheapest  iPad 2017  with the iPad 2018.  The new iPad is no different from the previous ones from the outlook perspective. It stands 9.7-inch tall and this times supports Apple pencil. The most part is similar except for some alterations in hardware to enable tilt and pressure recognition.  Apple has targeted the students with the new release. This might be a competitor for the very popular Google’s Chromebook.        Last year’s iPad was powered by A9 chipset whereas it is an upgrade in the new iPad as it is powered by A10 chipset. Even though it is an upgrade from the older version, it still stays stale with A11 already available in other gadgets.   The pencil stylus part makes it more education-friendly that it is easier to draw and write with the help of Apple pencil. But, Apple pencil does not come with the package. Apple has increased the cloud storage to 200GB from 5GB. That’s quite an increment and for feasible for students as well.  Timothy D Cook, Apple’s CEO said, “Our place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful products and tools that amplify learning and creativity.” \xa0Creativity and learning added together is definitely a strong blend.  The new software was also introduced which helps teachers to keep track of the assignments and improvements. The academics part is essential when the schools are being targeted. This new iPad also comes with the software that helps students learn musical instruments, art, videography and photography skills. This makes the iPad more interesting.   iPad 2018 Pricing  Apple seems to have understood the marketplace for lower-end gadgets when it comes to schools. This time, the iPad comes at affordable price i.e. $299 (32GB) for schools. While the actual starting price for it is $329 and the price increases with the larger memory variants.\xa0Apple Pencil is available for purchase separately for\xa0$99.  This portrays how Apple is once again keen on getting back its top position on sales and even more so with the development of student and teacher-friendly software along with discounts in the prices.

One of the true bezel-less display was portrayed in the very  first version of the Mi Mix  back in 2016 and the same philosophy follows till this date. With two generations in, Xiaomi has launched the third iteration of the Mi Mix lineup, the Mi Mix 2s.  Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s is not an entirely new version on the Mix series but it’s a slight upgrade over the  Mi Mix 2  as you might have already guessed from the ‘S’ on the name. There has been visual overhaul which seems to be prominent in the future  Xiaomi smartphones  as well. The dual rear camera placed vertically is the new signature look on Mi devices which we also saw on the  Redmi Note 5 Pro.         The phone offers 5.99-inch 18:9 LCD display with Full HD+ resolution. I always expect a QHD resolution with AMOLED panel on a flagship device these days but then again it’s not priced like a flagship. So for some, it might be a letdown to see an IPS panel here. Up front, the design remains the same with nothing but display and now a downsized chin on the bottom. With nowhere to place the camera, it still lies on the chin. This means you still have to flip your phone upside down everytime you take a selfie. But this also means that you don’t have to deal with a notch that holds the camera.  Since it’s a flagship phone and also happens to be an upgrade to Mi Mix 2, it has got some new hardware inside it. The device is now powered by the Snapdragon 845 chipset, the most powerful mobile chipset for Android as of now. You have the option to opt for either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. For storage, you get 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB memory option and you cannot expand it. The Mi Mix 2s is definitely not a slouch when it comes to performance.   The only reason to opt for the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s rather than Mi Mix 2 is, first – for the performance and second – the new and improved camera. The Mi Mix 2S has now opted for iconic vertical dual camera setup as seen on the  iPhone X . The 12MP  dual camera setup  enables 2x Optical Zoom. The primary sensor comes with dual pixel autofocus for faster focus speed and improved low light performance. There’s also Portrait Mode assisted by AI to intelligently separate the subject and background. This will result in better blur and sharper edges around the subject. The front facing camera still remains the same with a 5MP sensor. Most importantly, this bezel-less Chinese has scored  97 points in the DxOMark  test, which tied it with the all hailed  iPhone X  and the  Huawei Mate 10 Pro .  Giving life to this device is  MIUI 9  based on  Android 8.0 Oreo . The device is backed by the same 3400mAh battery. Even with the use of powerful  Snapdragon 845 chipset , Xiaomi claims the battery life should remain the same if not better. The phone supports Quick Charge 3.0.

['Smartphones with Dual Camera Setup available in Nepal'],"['Guides', 'Buy Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 27, 2018']",2018-03-26 18:25:42+00:00,"['Smartphones are capable of doing astounding things these days. The camera embedded in such 7mm thick devices is capable of shooting mind-boggling images mimicking the bulky DSLRs. With the advancements in smartphone cameras still in progress, we can see the smartphone makers are striving to bestow the DSLR capabilities into the smartphone cameras. And the presence of a dual camera on smartphones is one of the examples.  What are Dual camera smartphones?  In case of smartphones with dual camera setup, dual camera resides vertically or horizontally either on the front side or on the back panel or on both sides. Such setup essentially requires two lenses with a separate image sensor or film frame for each lens. Among the two cameras, the primary camera works like a normal or ordinary camera: it takes regular images. The secondary camera, however, gathers further information and the software blends the information from both cameras to produce images of fine quality and plenty of details.  Also Read:  Understanding smartphone camera terms        What is the purpose of Dual Camera on smartphones?  Dual lens camera, which is also known as a stereo camera is provided on the smartphones to produce vivid and well-detailed images. The presence of a dual camera on smartphones is analogous to the two eyes on human anatomy. The presence of two eyes on human body offers advantages like wide FOV (field of view), enhanced depth perception, ability to detect small objects, symmetry and more. And same goes true in the case of smartphones.  A DSLR can produce vibrant shots with plenty of details with a mere presence of single lens then why does a smartphone need a dual camera for the same purpose? This could be the bewilderment amongst the most. To explain in simple terms, DSLRs are equipped with a large aperture, big lens and large sensor, which make them of capable of incarcerating adequate light and plenty of details during the shots. But in the smartphones, providing such components only make it massive and probably impossible to fit in the pockets. And the battery power devoured by such setup is beyond imaginable. So the concept of the dual camera came as an alternative, where the details collected from two cameras blend to form one image resembling more or less like a DSLR output.  Advantages of dual camera setup on smartphones   Better picture quality  Greater depth of field in pictures  Improved dynamic range  Wide Field of View  Faster focus  Refocus ability  Vibrant colors  Well detailed  Lossless zooming  Improved Low light capabilities / Reduced Noise  Easy to apply effects (3D effect, augmented reality, Bokeh effect, etc.)   Some Applications of Dual-camera Setup on Smartphones  1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 3-Dimension  Back in 2011, when 3D was growing as a thing,  LG Optimus 3D  and  HTC Evo 3D  came with dual-camera setup capable of bringing 3D sensation on the videos and photos captured. Both the smartphones were the same technique used by the regular 3D cameras. The basic principle underlying the technique is to use the different perspective of dual-camera and create a sense of depth on images. When the subject information (primary camera) and depth information (secondary camera) blends into a single image/video, the 3D output can be obtained.  2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Depth Sensing  The technique involved here is alike to the 3D dual-camera setup. The primary camera captures details of the subject in focus. And the secondary camera garners the depth information of the components in the frame: segregating foreground and background according to distance. This feature allows capturing nifty portraits with Bokeh Effects (foreground focused and background blurred). This setup was employed on  HTC One M8 , where 4-Megapixel UltraPixel acted as primary sensor and the 2-megapixel sensor was employed to summon depth information onto the images.  3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Monochrome and RGB  Huawei entered the dual-camera game with the launch of Huawei P9 and P9 Plus partnering with Leica. The technology used on the device was quite unique. Among the two cameras, one was employed to capture monochrome (B/W) image. However, another one was used to fill in Colors (RGB) to complete the image. Huawei continued to provide similar setup on  Huawei GR5 2017 ,  Huawei P10 and P10 Plus. CoolPad Cool1  and  Nokia 8  also followed the same bandwagon.  In this technology, both cameras are quite identical in specs. In this technology, monochrome sensors summons plenty of details. Since the pixels in the monochrome sensor get triggered in little or low lights, the incarcerating of details is quite impressive. The other sensor (RGB) has the sole purpose to bring in colors. So the colors are unadulterated and natural. And the information collected so far from both the sensors combines into one with the software manipulation. As the Monochrome sensor garners plenty of details with the RGB sensor filling in colors, the end results are quite imposing.  4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Wide angle  This approach of dual-camera setup entered the tech world with the launch of  LG G5  last year. And LG continued to provide similar setup on the  LG G6  this year. This technology is quite straightforward. The two cameras work together to increase the field of view and to bring in wide prospects. With the single lens system, the field of view limits lower values. But with LG G5’s dual-camera setup, the field of view increased to an astounding 135-degrees. So with a similar setup on your smartphone, you won’t have to worry to be missed out on images even if you are being shot among a large group of people.  5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Telephoto  This setup is prevailing amongst a large number of smartphones these days. In this system, the secondary camera has a larger focal length as compared to the primary. This setup is unique to that of wide angle as this setup focuses on the lossless optical zooming. Distant objects can be brought to the frame without losing the image quality. This\xa0type of setup also has great insights on the depth sensing and brings out exquisite Bokeh effects. However, in this setup, the primary camera acts as a depth sensor. This type of setup can be found on  iPhone 7 Plus ,  iPhone 8 Plus ,  OnePlus 5 ,  Samsung Galaxy Note 8 ,  Xiaomi MI A1 , etc.  6.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Augmented Reality  With the smartphones focusing on Bokeh and zooming with the dual-camera,  Lenovo Phab 2 Pro  and  Asus ZenFone AR  come with an\xa0entirely new concept. The aforementioned smartphones serve as a foundation to Google Tango Project driving the tech world towards the Augmented Reality (AR). With this setup, the smartphone will be capable of knowing where everything sits in a 3D environment around it: the basic principle behind a lot of AR and VR content. These smartphones serve its use on the 3D mapping of rooms, scanning rooms and inserting objects to evaluate the real-life scenario, etc.  DSLRs vs Dual-camera smartphones  Although the dual-camera smartphones are in the race to rival the DSLRs, one thing is to be kept in mind is that DSLRs are employed with a large sensor, wide aperture, large pixel, and large sensor size, etc. So with such setup, zooming and effects are natural. Portraits shots and Bokeh effects are natural with increasing blurs with the increase in distance. However, with dual-camera setup, because of the depth-sensing, the foreground and the background can be segregated but the blurring of the background is entirely through the software. And seems to possess quite unnatural intensity.  Also in some cases, the subject lacks sharp edges with blurry borders, which is an utter disappointment. And in the case of zooming and wide-angle shots, dual-camera smartphones are way behind the DSLRs. Though the dual-camera smartphones are striving to mimic DSLR shots, they are nowhere close to DSLRs to rival them. However, in the matter of size, weight, and portability, dual-camera smartphones are the easy winner here.  Is two camera better than one?  If you are more of a kind to apply effects with switching modes while taking the shots, then dual-camera smartphones can be ideal for you. If you love traveling or visiting places then having a  wide-angle camera  as a companion turns out to be fruitful. For those, who are indulged into taking portraits and showcase into social media, the  Telephoto camera  would be the better choice. But if you love natural shots without artsy effects, the single-camera works perfectly fine.  In the answer to the question, burrowing the results from the popular camera benchmark test, DXoMark, two years back HTC U11 (single camera) surpassed the dual camera smartphones like iPhone 7 Plus, LG G5 and Huawei P9. Similarly, last year’s  Google Pixel 2/2XL  (single camera) has surpassed dual camera smartphones like iPhone 8 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 8.
