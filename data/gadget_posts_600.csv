['OPPO F7 Goes Official with 25MP Front camera and Full view Display'],['OPPO'],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['March 26, 2018']",2018-03-26 11:15:23+00:00,"['Chinese smartphone brand OPPO has officially unveiled its latest midrange phone, the  OPPO F7  in an event in India. It is the successor of the  OPPO F5  and offers improvement in front camera, performance, and display.  The OPPO F7, like any OPPO devices, is a selfie-centric smartphone. It houses a whopping 25MP front camera with Sony 576 sensor HDR. The hardware adjusts exposure to produce well-exposed selfies in different lighting condition. Moreover, with AI beauty 2.0, it recognizes 296 facial spots and\xa0 fine-tunes the beautification based on gender, age, skin tone, and skin type.\xa0  The AI beauty also extends to the 16MP dual back camera that can recognize up to 16 scenes such as food, pets, sky, beach to name a few.        The OPPO F7 boasts a 6.23-inch FullHD+ display (2280X1080 pixels) with 19:9 aspect ratio. There’s a notch on the top, but does it make a top-notch phone? We will have to wait and find out in our review. So, stay tuned.   During the launch event, OPPO didn’t mention which CPU the OPPO F7 comes equipped with. They just said an “Octa-core Processor” which is a shame because this time around it actually features a really powerful  Mediatek Helio P60  CPU. It’s the latest from the Taiwanese chipset manufacturer with a\xa012nm process and a combination of Cortex A73 and Cortex A53 cores. The result is a 70% performance improvement compared to the previous generation Helio P23 chipset used on the OPPO F5.  In terms of storage, there’s either 4GB or 6GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of storage. You can expand the storage via a dedicated microSD card slot up to\xa0256GB. In terms of connectivity, you get a dual SIM slot with 4G VOLTE support, WiFi b/g/n (no ac), Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS.  All these are being powered by a 3400mAh battery which promises 33.5 hours of music, 13.4 hours of video playback, and 8.3 hours of gaming.  On the software front, the OPPO F7 runs on Android 8.1 Oreo with Color OS 5.0 layered on top. For security, you get software simulated face unlock and a rear-facing fingerprint scanner.  OPPO F7 Price, Color Option, Availability in Nepal  OPPO F7 is available in 3 color option: Solar Red, Moonlight Silver, and a special edition Diamond Black. The 4GB/64GB version costs INR 21,990 (NRs. 35,184) and the 6GB/128GB version costs INR\xa026,990 (NRs. 43,184). It will be available in India starting April 9 from Flipkart (online) and Oppo’s retail stores.

['iPhone X Long Term Review – Apple Experience at a Price'],"['Apple', 'Reviews']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['March 25, 2018']",2018-03-25 14:16:32+00:00,"['Most of Apple fans will agree that they buy iPhone not for impressive features but for the experience. The latest  iPhone X  does not fail to deliver this experience which was essentially missing from previous models. The display, Face ID, camera, and design, holistically contributes to this new feel. I’ve been using the iPhone X for 3 months and here’s how the iPhone X has treated me so far.   iPhone X Specifications   Display : 5.8 inches Super AMOLED with Scratch-resistant glass  Resolution : 1125 x 2436 pixels, 458PPI pixel density  OS : iOS 11  Chipset : Apple A11 Bionic  RAM : 3GB  Storage : 64/256GB internal storage, No microSD card slot  Rear Camera : Dual 12MP, f/1.8 & f/2.4, OIS, phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, Quad-LED (dual tone) flash  Front Camera : 7 MP, f/2.2  Connectivity : Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, A-GPS, NFC (Apple Pay only), 3G, 4G LTE, USB 3.0 reversible connector  Sensors : Face ID, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer  Other Features : No 3.5mm headphone Jack, IP67 Certified (Water and Dust resistant), Fast Charging, Wireless charging, Dolby Vision/HDR10 compliant, 4K video recording up to 60fps & 1080P video recording up to 240fps          Having used the iPhone 6 Plus in the past, switching to the iPhone X so far was a satisfying experience. The display is the biggest standout feature for iPhone X with its new edge-to-edge screen up front. The nearly bezel-less 5.8-inch OLED display offers better colors and improved contrast ratio, but if you are coming from the punchy saturated display of Samsung flagships this might not seem that asto unding. The corner is rounded which looked awkward at first but now I prefer it more than the sharp-edged one.  Google might have run into some issues with the OLED panels with its flagship  Pixel 2XL , but the ones in the iPhone X don’t have any issues apart from the blue shift that OLED tends to create when you see it from a slanted angle. Nonetheless, it’s a great display.  There will be no new iPhone release without some controversy, and this time it’s related to the display itself. Well, technically not the entire display but just the top portion where that awful notch is located. And it is going to stand out as a constant irritant when you are watching videos on this phone – well that for a couple of weeks at least. The notch gets in the way of the video you are watching but since most of the action is happening in the middle, you kind of think it’s ok to have that notch.   But over the period of three months, I have grown to get used to it and it doesn’t bother much like it used to – and not having it would have been miles better overall. Unoptimized apps that do not have notch support just add a black border on top and bottom portion filching the full display view. That has now been solved as most of the apps are following the new guidelines to build apps that have support for the notch.   The iPhone X also has a new camera placement on the left placed vertically. I thought it was downright ugly when I saw the phone in the pictures. Seeing the phone in flesh, my thoughts have pretty much changed. The iPhone X looks great from the back. And the Camera placement? Well, it’s just there and it works great. I don’t mind it anymore.  The dual 12MP Camera both have OIS making it ideal for lowlight conditions and shooting great stabilized videos. It is one of the first phones to support 4k at 60fps and shoots full HD at 240fps.  iPhone always has been a great choice for content creators on a budget. With the array of professional apps and the hardware capacity of this phone, you can very much start getting creative the minute you get your hands on this device.             At first glance, the images looked outstanding to my eyes, but upon comparing it with the  Samsung S9  what I found out was the whites have a yellow tone to it. And when shooting a yellow object it will boost up the color and turn it into orange. The dynamic range is commendable along with good contrast. I was very much satisfied with the image I took with this phone during the daytime as it would always look close to natural without any boost in saturation. When it comes to lowlight, the details are good but highlights are a bit off. But still, you won’t be disappointed with the results.  The 7MP front-facing true depth camera takes fine selfies with good lighting. Images from the front are also natural looking but at times it tends to saturate the brown skin tone to make it more orange.   The bokeh selfies were not accurate at first but over time it has gotten better at edge detection to get a proper depth of field effect.   Also, the animojis are fun to play with but it’s something I found myself using less over time. When comparing the animojis with the Samsung’s AR emojis, the Apple has done an excellent job tracking the facial expressions while the Samsung one just feels half-baked.   The Face ID is near to flawless. It has lower failure rate than Touch ID. It works great in bright sunlight, dark no light, with/without style accessories. I haven’t had any major issues in all these months and feel that the pros of Face ID outweigh the pros of Touch ID, although I would have preferred a Touch ID at the side or the back.  One cool Face ID feature that I liked was the ability to read lock screen notification only by the owner. So no one can peek into my notifications. Another important contributor to this new experience is the reliance on gesture to navigate. Even if it took me few hours to get used to it, it now feels like second nature to me. I do not miss the iconic home button. However, I believe that much more can be done with gestures to improve accessibility.   Performance wise the A11 Bionic is still the fastest chip on any smartphone. It is a hexacore chipset and all of them can run simultaneously.\xa0Among six cores, two high performance 2.39GHz Monsoon cores deliver 22% more power than the A10 fusion and the four low-powered Mistral cores are 75% faster compared to the earlier generation.  The chipset also houses the Apple’s first in-house GPU with 3 cores ditching the Power VR. It is 30% more powerful than its predecessor. It’s not just extra numbers that Apple is throwing at us, in the real-life performance one can feel the miles of difference in performance when using the iPhone X.  I do not feel any lag or issues when using performance heavy apps and games. Navigating the UI is as smooth as you can think on an iPhone. Also, with 3GB of RAM multitasking between loads of apps wasn’t an issue. Games load up in a jiffy and you can easily play the game in highest settings possible without breaking a sweat.  I consider myself a moderate user, and a full charge on its 2716 mAh battery gives me enough to last for the day and this includes apps, GPS, social media, music, camera and more. The iPhone X finally supports fast charging, that will charge the device up to 50% within 30 minutes. But you must buy a separate charging brick which is too expensive, especially in Nepal.  It is also worth mentioning that I had some moderate heating issues with the phone. Lack of optimization of different apps could be at play, but the good news is its fixed now.  CONCLUSION   When it comes to the most premium flagships in Nepal, you have the choice of either the Samsung S9 or the iPhone X. The iPhone X is the way to go if you are tied up with the ecosystem.  But if you are looking for the value of the price you pay then consider this – the S9 and the S9+ comes with 1-year breakage insurance which will give you a sound sleep making sure you are covered if you run into some mishaps with your phone. Also, I shouldn’t forget to mention that the iPhone X 64GB costs Rs. 40,000 more than the Galaxy S9+.  Turning to the iPhone X if you happen to break the screen then hear this! You have to pay Rs. 80,0000 to the Apple service center in return to get your phone replaced with a new one!  For me most of the core assets of S9 and iPhone X like the display, camera and feel are very similar and I’d definitely think twice before pouring in a huge chunk of cash just for the experience per se.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/iphone-X-long-term-review.jpg']

The smartphone is powered by Snapdragon 636 processor which the  Redmi note 5 Pro  sports as well. Redmi turns out to be a top performer on the mid-range segment.

Oppo A71 2018 specifications:   Display: 5.2-inches IPS LCD Captivative touchscreen, 16:9 aspect ratio (282 PPI pixel density)  Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 450  CPU: Octa-core 1.8 GHz Cortex- A53  GPU: Adreno 506  OS: Android Nougat 7.1  Battery: 3,000 mAh non-removable Li-ion battery  USB: Micro USB 2.0  Front camera: 5 MP f/2.4  Rear camera:13 MP f/2.2 with phase detection autofocus, LED flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR, panorama, etc. Video: 1080p@30 fps  RAM:2 or 3 GB  ROM: 16 GB expandable up to 256 GB  SIM: Dual SIM (nano SIMs, dual standby)  Sensors: Accelerometer, proximity, Compass  Colors: Gold and Black (for Nepal)  Price: Rs. 17,250   Early Verdict  Budget smartphones \xa0often come with the compromises. To keep the prices low, manufacturers go with the mediocre components and the users have to face several issues in the long run. However, with the performance boost with the Snapdragon 450 chipset in the A71 2018, users can barely find issues even while playing high-end games. Similarly, Oppo has also gifted this newbie with the sensational AI beauty feature, which debuted in its home-manufactured Oppo F5 smartphone.   The absence of the fingerprint sensor might bother some users since the feature is available with the smartphones like  Colors S11 ,  Moto E4 , and  Gionee X1 , which are available at similar price. But nonetheless, the smartphone is remarkably\xa0good in terms of performance and camera and seems to justify the price. These are our early verdict regarding the smartphone. We will come with the detailed review to offer broader insights regarding the Oppo A71 2018. So don’t forget to  subscribe to our YouTube channel  and make sure you check it regularly.

This time HTC has announced the Desire 12 and 12 Plus that packs a ceramic glass back with a glossy finish similar to that of the  HTC U11 .  HTC Desire 12   The Desire 12 is the small phone among the two with the display size of 5.5-inches. It comes with the tall 18:9 ratio with HD+ resolution (720×1440). With minimal bezels on the top and the bottom, the device sure looks appealing. MediaTek MT6739 chipset – an upgrade over the popular MT6737 powers this device coupled with either 2 or 3GB of RAM. Also, the storage option includes 16GB and 32GB depending on your preference of RAM. But fortunately, the storage is expandable up to 2TB.

['Coolpad Cool Play 6 Review: The Mid-Range Powerhouse'],"['Android', 'Coolpad', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['March 20, 2018']",2018-03-20 15:02:27+00:00,"['At a time when most of the smartphones launched in Nepal are focusing on the ergonomics, Coolpad has launched a device that aims to fulfill the performance needs of a user. The Coolpad Cool Play 6 is a new member of the Coolpad family that has 6 GB RAM, a huge battery and dual cameras at helm. Do these features, and the device as a whole suffice the needs of its users? Let’s find out in this full review!   Coolpad Cool Play 6 Specifications:   5.5-inch full HD display\xa0(1080 x 1980 pixels)  Android 7.1.1 Marshmallow with Journey UI (Planned upgrade to Android Oreo)  64GB ROM (expandable)  6GB RAM  13 MP Dual Rear-facing Camera with f/2.0 aperture, dual-tone LED flash, 6P Lens, 4K Video Recording  8 MP Front Facing Camera with f/2.2 aperture  Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 64-bit SoC  Octa-core CPU(4x ARM Cortex A72 &\xa0x ARM Cortex A53)  Adreno 510 GPU  Fingerprint Sensor (rear-mounted)  USB Type-C connectivity  Non-removable 4,060 mAh battery   Performance  Before talking about any other aspect of the Cool Play 6, let’s jump right into the performance setting of the device. The Coolpad Cool Play 6 houses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 chipset alongside 6 GB of RAM and Adreno 510 GPU. All these specifications do sound pleasing to the ear. And at a time when a couple of smartphones focus on advertising features that they can’t accomplish in real life, the Coolpad Cool Play 6 actually delivers what it promises. With the whopping 6 GB of RAM and the octa-core CPU, the device never let me down. Never once did the “Your app has crashed” window popped up, nor were there stutters. However, I did notice a couple of rare lags while opening applications, but that lasted only for a few milliseconds!        This is clearly shown in the benchmark tests.   Gionee M7 Power Antutu Benchmark  Infogram  The Coolpad Cool Play 6 outperforms every other mid-range smartphone currently available in Nepal. Even though the device gave me unreliable results on Antutu that ranged all the way from 80000 to 90000 it still scores higher than the Xiaomi Mi A1 and the Oppo F5 which are the nearest competitors of the Cool Play 6.  But one thing that bugged me a lot was the heating issue of the device. The Cool Play 6 heated up after 15 minutes of gaming, which is not that much of an issue, but is still noticeable. This may be partly because of the processor at helm. Coolpad’s newest smartphone could have done much better had it featured a Snapdragon 636 chipset.  The gaming performance this device showed was quite good. While playing midrange to low end games, the performance was commendable. Only at times, with high end games, there were minor, very minor lags. That happened only a few times, and went unnoticed. The graphics, while playing games look very satisfying.  Talking about the software, the Coolpad Cool Play 6 runs on Android v7.1.1 out of the box. The company had promised an Oreo update last December, but the update is still on beta testing right now. So, users who are after software updates can rely on Coolpad to provide the device the Oreo upgrade.  The user-interface of the device is where Coolpad has improved, and that too a lot. Take the notification shade for an example, in last year’s Cool1, we had to one of the capacitive buttons to access the notification shade, but with the Cool Play 6, everything seems to be “normal” and in place. So, software wise, the improved Journey UI is now better and much improved.  Design and Display   The Coolpad Cool Play 6 is a device enclosed in a metallic body. There is plastic border at the top and bottom on the rear side that helps with the antennae. And talking about the design, this device lacks a uniqueness as there is nothing new that we haven’t seen. It looks like a design from last year, I must admit that the unibody design of Samsung J7 Pro, Huawei Nova 2i, and Mi A1 are superior compared to the Cool Play 6.  The dual camera at the back is accompanied by dual flash and a fingerprint scanner at the bottom. But still, the Cool Play 6 feels premium on hands but like every other metallic smartphone, I would suggest you to case it up!   And at the front lies a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display that comes in the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. I would have really liked it if Coolpad had opted for the trendy near bezel-less display or with the 18:9 aspect ratio, but oh well!  The display panel, however, is quite bright and colorful. Viewing contents and playing games on this full HD display feel amazing and there is even an option in the UI that lets users change the display calibration which I think all smartphones should have. However, this display comes a little short of the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro which has a well-saturation Super AMOLED display.  Battery   Backing up this 5.5-inch display is a 4,060 mAh battery. In my usage, this battery really delivered. Under heavy usage which included browsing through a list of applications, browsing through the internet and playing a lot of games, I got around 5 – 5 and a half hours of screen-on-time which goes up to 6 hours if you are into “normal usage”. So, basically, your device will not die for around a day and a half.  One thing that really bugged me was the time this battery took to go from 0 to a hundred percent. Even though Snapdragon 653 chipset supports quick charge 3.0, the Coolpad Cool Play 6 lacks any quick charge support as the device took me more than 2 hours to fully charge the device. For a battery focused smartphone, Coolpad has sure fallen short as the lack of quick charge is a disappointment.  Camera   Now on to the camera, like with its predecessor Cool 1, there is a dual rear-facing camera setup on the Cool Play 6. This setup is capable of talking pictures with shallow depth of field which Coolpad calls “SLR” mode. And we compared this feature with the Portrait Mode of Xiaomi Mi A1 in bright light. And while we have to say that the pictures from the Cool Play 6 are great and nearly perfect for its price, the Mi A1 still comes out on top as you can see from the samples.  Portrait Pictures: Xiaomi Mi A1 vs Coolpad Cool Play 6  While most reviewers from other countries had slagged off the camera of the Cool Play 6, I actually quite liked it. The color reproduction is quite good and there is ample saturation in the pictures. The smartphone doesn’t expose images, which is quite nice and the level of details is high as well. There is enough brightness and contrast in the pictures and the detailing is quite good too.   Talking about the dual cameras, the Cool Play 6 needs a bit of improvement. It produces the blur quite well but somehow fails to focus the subject entirely. If you take a look at this image, the device has blurred out the backgound well in the upper half, but in the lower half, there is very less distinction between the blur and the subject. The portrait mode I think, is better in the Mi A1.   However, under night light, the pictures are a bit noisy and there are grains here and there. But then again, the pictures are still pleasing to the eye, and the SLR mode in this light definitely better than the one on the Mi A1.   Talking about the selfies, the 8-megapixel front-facing camera is probably one of the best selfie camera on a mid-range smartphone as my selfies even we well-detailed and sharp under low-light setting. And in broad day light, the lenses do a good job to maintain the color accuracy of the pictures.   Hardware   On the storage side of things, the Coolpad Cool Play 6 comes with 64 GB of storage with no option to expand, which is a real bummer since all its competitors have expandable memory. For a device that is focused on gaming and photography, I really think Coolpad should have included an option to expand the memory.  There are dual speaker grills on the device among which only one works as a speaker. At a time when smartphone manufacturers are forgetting about speaker on their smartphones, the Coolpad Cool Play 6 seems to be following the same trend as well.  Conclusion  Coolpad has come up with the Cool Play 6 after a year of launching the Cool1. With the new smartphone, the company has high hopes of penetrating the smartphone market of Nepal. And I have to say, the Cool Play 6 actually has the capability to achieve that as there are on a few departments where I had complaints. I won’t be wrong if I say that the device is a powerhouse that suffices your day to day needs be it performance-wise or camera-wise. Yes, it gets warm while playing games and the design is just average, but for Rs. 30,000 you can hardly complain.  If you are not impressed with the Coolpad Cool Play 6, you can certainly take a look at the  Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro , the  Huawei Nova 2i , the  Xiaomi Mi A1  or wait for the  Xiaomi Redmi 5 Pro !      Pros  Cons    Battery Life  Lack of Quick Charge    Camera Performance  Slight heating issue    Bright and Colorful Display  Traditional Display    Improved User Interface  Lack of expandable memory']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Coolpad-Cool-Play-6-Review.jpg']

OPPO  has finally launched its most awaited OPPO R15 and R15 dream mirror smartphones. OPPO was to launch these smartphones on the 31st of March. But who doesn’t like surprises right?  Let’s start with the outlook first. All the rumors and the leak have turned out to be true. It does have the iPhone X like a notch. The 19:9 aspect ratio and 6.2- inch OLED screen.  Let’s dive into the full specifications of these smartphones.        OPPO R15  The phone looks like the iPhone X with the notch on top and a 19.9 aspect ratio. The back is similar in a way that it has a glass back but not everything in the rear looks the same. It has a rear fingerprint sensor and the dual cameras are horizontally aligned. The glass panel on this one is of 2.5D and the display at the front is full HD+.  Many of the phones have opted for a dual camera at the back for 2018. The same goes with the Oppo F15 as there are rear cameras are of 16MP f/1.7 and 5MP f/2.2 respectively. Oppo R15 makes use of the Sony IMX519 lens which Oppo claims can automatically recognize up to 120 scenes.  OPPO smartphones are always known for being selfie-experts. The manufacturer does not surprise us here with the 20MP for a selfie camera which is apparently AI smart beauty and AI wisdom smart beauty driven.   The smartphone is powered by MediaTek Helio P60 chipset coupled with 6GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage, which is quite impressive. With a dual hybrid SIM slot, an additional 256GB of expandable memory gives us the convenient vibe. Not having to transfer the files time and again or delete for that matter.  The phone runs on the Android Oreo 8.1 which is the latest as of when the phone was in the making. OPPO is time and again accused of not sending updates so we’ve to see if OPPO changes for better or stays the same.  This smartphone costs $473 approximately making it a premium mid-range smartphone.  OPPO R15 dream mirror edition  The phone is pretty much same as the earlier one. The same glass back, rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and the dual camera. But the glass at the back of this one is a 3D one.  On the camera part, there is a combination of 16 MP and 20 MP dual cameras at the rear and a 20MP camera for the selfie as it has the ‘selfie-expert’ criteria to meet as per its claim. The software enhanced bokeh effect and AI smart beauty and AI wisdom smart beauty feature also for the selfies.  The smartphone is powered by a Snapdragon 660 chipset which is a recent one from the manufacturer. Supported by a 14nm chip, it is claimed to be battery saving, efficient and to deliver the high-end performance compared to its predecessor Snapdragon 653. This particular SoC is the one that supports AI (artificial intelligence) in the mid-range smartphones.   The smartphone costs approximately $552 for the ceramic black variant while the red variant will cost $520 approximately.  Looking at the specifications and comparing them with the cost of these smartphones, these seem promising. The AI feature, class back and VOOC charging are the ones that impress us the most. The specifications are of a top notch for any mid-range smartphone.  We can settle for the fact that it looks like  iPhone X . The outlook of which we are not much impressed with but we can settle on this for the features it consists of. Let’s hope OPPO comes up with some original ideas for the outlook as well.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/oppo-R15.jpg']

['Android claims to be as safe as iOS in terms of Malware'],"['Android', 'iOS']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['March 18, 2018']",2018-03-18 02:37:10+00:00,"['We are all the witnesses of the battle between two of the best Operating Systems (OS), i.e. Google’s  Android  and Apple’s  iOS . Not just the witnesses but we are the part of a crowd where we do not step back from taking sides in this matter.  This battle has forever been an unresolved issue with no substantial outcome. However, there is one thing Android is time and again called out on and that is for being prone to malware. iOS has always gotten one up in this battle up until now.  In the past, Android has been a platform for ‘dangerous malware’ time and again. Some malware such as Stagefright bug (2015), Hummingbad (2016), and\xa0Vault 7 (2017) have made headlines for all the wrong reasons.        According to David Kleidermacher,\xa0Google’s head of security for Android, “ Android is as safe as the competition.”  We can easily speculate that iOS is the “competition” he is talking about, considering the neck-to-neck competition these Operating Systems have.  One of the reasons that  Google  has lagged behind in the security process is, security was never the primary concern. But now, security is gaining importance as Google is constantly criticized in this aspect.  According to Kleidermacher, there are two major areas in which Android is now better than before:  1.  Security updates : One of the main problems with the Android devices is; they are not as up to date as the iOS devices are. As for Android, it is a long process. First the development of updates then the distribution to manufacturers and at last the manufacturer’s distribution to the users.  According to a report, “ The majority of the deployed devices for over 200 different Android models from over 30 device manufacturers are running a security update from the last 90 days.”  2.  Keeping out the bad apps : Google will now push the malicious apps out of the play store and warn users in case such apps are being downloaded. According to Google, it deleted almost 39 million such malicious apps from users’ phones. That is quite a high number.  The Google Play Service also comes into the play to provide a  ‘malware free ’ Android experience. As it ‘protect scans’ for what it calls “the possibly harmful” apps. Not just that, Google is also paying the bug hunters very high per flaw. Who would not want to find a bug that way?  We can definitely figure out that Android has taken many leaps forward this year around. The Android security scenario now seems strategically well thought of. Other than that, if a new bug affects the devices or not, can only present us with the clearer outcome.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/iPhone-Vs-Android-Security.jpg']

With the efforts of various smartphone companies, innovations regarding smartphone cameras are up and coming. Vivo, a well-known smartphone giant has recently revealed AI-powered super HDR technology that takes HD to a whole different level by adapting to complex lighting environment.  At a media event in China, Vivo introduced its cutting-edge AI-powered HDR that allows auto- scene detection to produce clearer photos, better colors, more details and better tones. Vivo has also made a breakthrough when it introduced backlit photography technology and with this innovation, it is surely taking mobile photography to a newer level.  The super HDR works in a similar fashion as the regular HDR but what it does differently is that it merges more frames to resolve the problems presented by contrasting strong dark and light tones in a photo. Vivo says that super HDR supports an HDR of up to 14 EV (exposure values) that captures up to 12 frames per shot. There more to the technology as it also uses AI to analyze the scene, choose the correct exposure and select frames to merge.                   With the new AI super HDR technology, you can now get greater flexibility in terms of frames providing more image options for merging to perfectly light all the aspects of a photo. You can get more optimized details under an extreme light so that shadows and highlights are well balanced. In addition to this, you can also get improved photos at all stages with the advanced AI feature. How this works is, the moment the shutter is pressed, the AI will detect the scene to determine the ideal exposure and accordingly select the frames for merging.  What else you can expect from the super HDR is that it is highly adaptable to a different environment, it selects accurate and smart exposure and has intelligent identification of unique shapes of objects. Through this, you get natural looking results and perfectly lit portraits.  Alex Feng, a senior at Vivo says,  “Vivo continues to push the boundaries and provides the ultimate camera experience for consumers. This goes beyond just adding powerful functions, but to developing innovations that our users can immediately enjoy. Today’s showcase of Super HDR is an example of our continued commitment to mobile photography, to enable our consumers to shoot professional quality photos at the touch of a button.”  Sadly, Vivo has not yet said which phone will feature this technology.

Their products are used worldwide. They manufacture quite a variety of electronics one of which are smartphones.  A  lot of rumors  have been doing rounds from time to time about the new flagship from LG.  If rumors are to be believed, LG is all set to come up with a new smartphone to be released under its  ‘G’  series.        The new phone will be a follow-up to the  LG G6  which was launched last year. Despite the excellence in performance G6 was overshadowed because of the competition. So, LG is concerned on making it strategically good for the market this year around.  Supposedly, the device will have an OLED display which apparently is brighter than standard  IPS LCD  screens.  The display will be of  19.5:9  aspect ratio with the screen standing  6-inch  tall. The length of the phone might not sound practical enough but the narrower width and minimal bezels will make holding the phone convenient.  A lot has been said as to what the outlook of the G7 will be like. It is said to sport an ‘optional’ notch display. Yes, an optional notch. This time it is the best of both worlds. The notch will be inculcated as its software feature. The user can keep it or just change the settings. That is what we call versatility.  The LG G7 will come with the  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset , which seems to be a common feature in the smartphones of 2018. LG is said to be working with QUALCOMM for the chipset.  The latest version of Android, the Android P is expected in the handset. One of its features is that it allows moving the icons. This means more screen space as per the user’s convenience.  In the camera department, the LG G7 will have dual rear cameras 16-megapixels each. However, there are still no leaks regarding the front-facing camera of the G7.  We will be able to know how much of it is true only once the phone is out in the market. If the rumors are true, the phone seems pretty promising with the  OLED  display and the Snapdragon 845 SoC. Let’s wait and see if the LG G7 is what we are expecting it to be. The rumors already have our hopes high!  The smartphone might cost around $729 and above.  LG G7 Specifications (rumored):   Display:  6-inch OLED display, 19.5:9 aspect ratio  Chipset:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845  Camera:  Dual rear cameras (16 MP each), HDR10 imaging  Protection : IP68 protection (water, dust, and impact resistant)  Sound:  Stereo speakers (boombox)  Charging:  Wireless Charging Enabled ($129 approx).']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/LG-G7.jpg']

Well, that’s a good news for someone looking for an excellent phone on a budget. The Mi A1 still is one of the best budget phones as it comes with all the latest hardware and is by no means an outdated phone. The Mi A1 being an Android One device gets the latest stock Oreo 8.0 OS out of the box and will also get the recently announced  Android 9.0 .  The Mi A1, however, has a 5.5-inch 16:9 FHD display, when the latest trend is a bigger display with 18:9 aspect ratio. Yes, that’s by no means a deal breaker, but even Xiaomi’s own  Redmi 5 Plus  has got one and costs Rs. 22,499.         In terms of performance, the Mi A1 excels the competition by a huge margin. The Snapdragon 625 SoC coupled with 4GB of RAM and stock UI ensures smooth performance and edges midrangers like Oppo F5 Youth, J7 Max, and Huawei Nova 2i.  The camera performance is, however, a mixed bag. The dual 12MP rear camera takes excellent portraits and daylight images but fails to\xa0effectuate during low light conditions.

Facebook, on the 9th of March, announced a ‘ holistic partnership with licensing agreement’  with WMG.  How does this partnership change the way we use Facebook?  Well, it is going to be a bit different than before but in a better way. Warner Music Group currently represents music stars like Madonna and Ed Sheeran and bands like Metallica and Linkin Park. Facebook is a guardian company to other social media apps like Instagram and Whatsapp and there is no doubt that the deal is something that will change our experiences.  Now that the agreement is made, users can use WMG’s music which includes audios from the artists and bands affiliated with the company. The videos that consist of Warner’s licensed music will not be taken down by Facebook.        The agreement not only includes Facebook but also Instagram and Oculus. We have heard well enough of Instagram but what’s Oculus?  Oculus is the Virtual Reality based sister company on Facebook. This means the virtual reality experience will also get some musical merit.  Social media has emerged out as the most prominent one among the forms of media. no other form of media is able to provide the exposure social media is able to provide. The number of daily users is also vast. There is also a chance for the new artists to shine and take one step forward to fame.  Ole Oberman, the chief digital manager for Warner’s said,  “ Our partnership with   Facebook  will help expand the universe of music streaming and create supplementary revenue for artists. Fan-created video is one of the most personal, social and often viral ways that music is enjoyed, but its commercial potential is largely untapped. This collaboration will lead to new possibilities for our artists while enhancing the user experience across Facebook, Instagram and Oculus, and enabling people to communicate and express themselves using the music they love.”  This agreement will pay royalties as per the popularity of the musician’s creations. Fair enough right? Facebook and the musicians both will be deriving profits from the agreement. Us users also benefit from the agreement, of course.  As per the information going around, Facebook is shifting its focus from news to entertainment in order to avoid controversies and to engage more users.  This is not the first time that Facebook has made such an agreement but this definitely seems like a win-win situation for all the parties involved.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/facebook-warner.jpg']

Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ Specifications  The\xa0Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ are more smooth and sleek as ever with a glass back and a top-notch display sandwiching an aluminum frame. One of the main changes on the devices is the fingerprint scanner which is now placed right below the camera setup.   And the major change is the camera itself as the Samsung\xa0Galaxy S9+ has become the first member of the S-series to house dual cameras at the back. On top of that, one of the lenses has an adjustable aperture (f/1.5 or f/2.4), which is why Samsung is cashing so much on the cameras of the device.  While the Galaxy S8 and S8+ didn’t really have much of a difference, the S9 and S9+ differ in a couple of areas, one of them is the camera department and the other in terms of the battery as the S9 comes with a 3,000 mAh battery and the S9+ has a 3,500 mAh battery.   Likewise, there have also been a few changes in the display front as the bezels have shrunken, providing a much better “Infinity experience” to the users. The Galaxy S9 is 5.8-inch tall whereas the plus variant has a 6.2-inch display. Both the displays are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and have a Super AMOLED panel.

The Chinese smartphone brand had scheduled to launch its upcoming handset in India on 27 th  March. However, ahead of the launch, the anticipated device leaked in images revealing the design language used and some of the features packed inside.  The upcoming Vivo V9 is the successor of the  Vivo V7 , which was launched last year. And as suggested by the leaked images, the newbie will be following the design of its predecessor. Looking at the images, it can be seen that the smartphone looks seamless with a  near bezel-less display . Alike its predecessor, the Vivo V9 will get along with the 18:9 aspect ratio. However, one major change in the V9’s design would be the notch on the top. These days, smartphone makers seem to be quite obsessed with the notch on the top like the  iPhone X . And Vivo V9 chose to follow the bandwagon.         Furthermore, the rear camera on the device gives the glimpse of the iPhone X. The vertically aligned dual cameras at the back have a close resemblance. But despite being so impressed with the iPhone X design, the handset has not quite obliterated the 3.5mm headphone jack. There is still a port for the 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom, which lies meticulously on the left of the Micro-USB charging port. For the audio output, the device has placed the mono speaker grill, which also lies on the bottom.   Another leaked image shows that the device has a slot for the two SIM cards. There is also an SDcard slot for the memory expansion but it takes the SIM2 slot. Talking about the OS, Vivo V9 will have  Android Oreo  on its system with an extra flavor from the company’s home-baked FunTouch OS on the top. And keeping the track of the rumors, there are speculations that the smartphone will come with the  Snapdragon 660 chipset  paired with 4GB or 6GB of RAM.   Vivo being the  selfie-centric smartphone , it often comes with the catchy taglines like the Moonlight selfies, Clearer selfies, etc. This time too, with 24MP selfie camera, Vivo V9’s intentions can be predicted. If the rumors and leaked images come true, it might pose a threat to the other selfie-centric smartphones like the  Oppo F5 .  The use and the placement of the fingerprint sensor in the V9 had also excited its fan base. With the presentation of the  Vivo X20 Plus UD with the in-display fingerprint sensor  and the impressive  Vivo Apex with pure bezel-less display and under display fingerprint  in the  CES 2018  and  MWC 2018  respectively, most of the tech enthusiasts had a similar expectation. But contrary to that expectations, the smartphone maker placed the fingerprint sensor on the back.  Update: Vivo has listed the company’s upcoming smartphone on its Indian website which contradicts some of the rumors that were flying around on the internet.   According to the listing on Vivo’s website, the Vivo V9 will sport a 6.3-inch AMOLED display that might will have a 19:9 aspect ratio. This device will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 chipset, which is surprising, as most rumors had hinted towards Snapdragon 660 chipset. In terms of storage, the device will have 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory which can expand up to 256 GB via a dedicated microSD card slot.  The Vivo V9 will feature a vertical camera setup with dual camera lenses (16-megapixel and 5-megapixel). It will run on Android v8.1 Oreo out of the box which the listing confirms. This OS will be the basis for Vivo’s own Funtouch OS 4.0.

Countless brands like  Huawei ,  Gionee ,  Oppo ,  Vivo ,  Xiaomi , etc have established their presence around the globe. Among the others, India has been one of the latest evidence of the Chinese smartphone brand’s upsurge.  Chinese smartphone companies like Oppo and Vivo have strong offline strategies to market and sell their products in India. They aggressively spent marketing through offline channels, mainly retailers to reach and communicate their product offerings to people.  However, these companies have decided to adopt a different strategy from now on. Following what Xiaomi did, Oppo and Vivo have also decided to cut their offline marketing practices to a certain extent and move on to online selling. These companies are now trying to generate revenue rather than reaching more and more places within India.         Both companies are taking hard measures to increase their revenue and in doing so, they have cut margins for the retailers by around 40%, which has cost them a loss of 10,000 sales outlets each. According to reports, both companies had around 70,000 outlets throughout India and slashing the retailers’ margins have led to a steep fall in the number of stores selling their products.  The strategy, according to officials of both the companies is that they want to focus on selling their offerings through fewer effective outlets where they can enjoy good presence and visibility. At the same time, these companies are opting for online sales in Vivo launching its own online store in India, making a way for e-commerce for itself.  “Regarding Vivo’s trade channel strategy, we have redeployed our distribution strategy with a focus on providing varies choices and experience for customers,” said a spokesperson form Vivo regarding the matter.  This looks like a similar move inspired by Xiaomi that has managed to take over the raining Samsung market in India.  Hard actions as such have led Oppo to move out from the top 5 rankings. The market share of the company in India is 4% currently which one year ago was 9%. Similarly, the market share of Vivo has decreased to 7%.  Well, the move may be a hit or a fall for the companies. But if we take the reference of a similar strategy by Xiaomi, it went quite well.

Near-stock Android  has always been a magnetic force for the ones who desire smooth functioning.  As per the rumors, we are not very far from yet another release from OnePlus. The smartphone is codenamed ‘A6000’. The A6000 might be officially named OnePlus 6 looking at its trend of naming the smartphones.        This flagship from the Chinese manufacturer OnePlus is rumored to be priced around £500. As to how the new OnePlus 6 might look, we can take a hint from the Oppo R15 as it is the guardian company for OnePlus. The phone will be having a dual rear camera. Horizontal or vertical? Not yet decided as different rumors have it different.  Well, ready for some tragic nostalgia? The OnePlus 6 will probably sport a notch as the  iPhone X \xa0and  Essential PH-1 phone  does. Hope, this rumor doesn’t turn into a reality. Apart from that, it is also said that the smartphone would possess  near bezel-less display  with 19:9 aspect ratio. That might make it one of the smartphones with the biggest screen for 2018.  The fingerprint sensor will be placed at the back as it has recently moved it from the front in its OnePlus 5T.  It is said to feature a  Snapdragon 845 chipset . We can expect some fast functioning of the smartphone. Not just going by the version of the chipset but AnTuTu score of 276,510 speaks for itself.  On the screen part, it will probably shift from Full HD to a Quad-HD with its new release. At least that’s what we expect.  That’s all we have of the ‘OnePlus 6’ as of now.

['Android P Developer Preview 1 is Out. Here’s what’s new!'],"['Android', 'Google']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['March 9, 2018']",2018-03-09 14:51:44+00:00,"['While we all have been waiting for the  Android Oreo  update on our smartphones, Google has released the first developer preview of Android P. We don’t know what P stands for but there’s plenty of time to dwell on that with the official launch scheduled on Q3 of 2018.  As this is the first Developer Preview, it is in Alpha stage and few more version updates will be published in the future.  Quick settings and Notification Bar         One of the big changes seen on Android P is the revamped quick settings menu. The icons are big and the blue colored indication of settings turned ON looks playful. The icons are clearly visible and better identifiable. Android seems to have done this to make the UI more user-friendly making it easier for the new users to cope up with Android. The quick setting tiles are now vertically scrollable instead of horizontal pagination. And applying dark wallpaper will convert the quick settings background to dark but it doesn’t affect the settings menu.  Also when you get a new text message, the notification bar will show the image of the sender. When pictures are sent in instant messaging, full picture preview is available on the notification bar if the app is optimized to do so. Not to forget smart replies are now built in. Every time you get a message notification, your notification bar will show options for pre-calculated replies. This feature was first featured in Google Allo messaging app.  Power Button   Long press on the power button will not only give power and restart options but there’s a new addition to the menu, the option for the screenshot. Along with the screenshot button, Android P has introduced the Markup editor which lets the user edit screenshots by letting them draw and add texts to it. If you want to try the new Markup Editor, here’s an apk you can install.  Download Android P Markup Editor  Volume Controls  Image: Droid Life  The big and most welcome change in the preview is the new volume controls. They are now on the right-hand side placed vertically so you can easily control it using a single hand. You can also choose between the volume of different media. There’s a separate icon below the volume control to put your phone to the ringer, vibrate or silent.  Notch Support   As we have seen in  MWC 2018  a lot of Android smartphones have adopted the notch like the  iPhone X . It’s not the kind of trend that we consumers want to see. But nonetheless, they have been hugely implemented and the new Android P build is ready for the awful notches. There are three options for coping the app with various cutouts namely:   Narrow Display Cutouts  Tall Display Cutout  Wide Display Cutout   Also, the quick settings color we mentioned earlier turns to green when the notch is activated. The clock now resides on the right-hand side because of the notch.  Settings Menu   The Setting Menu has got a facelift. Instead of the dull grey and white colors – now the settings menu is full of playful colors. It certainly provides more material design vibes to it. But once you go a step deeper into the menu the same black and white menu prevails.  Multi-Camera API  With the Multi-Camera API, third-party developers will be able to properly use the dual cameras that have been popularly popping up in Android devices. With this addition, apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and other messaging apps will be able to use the features like seamless zoom, bokeh, and stereo vision. Also, there are under the hood changes for optimization.  Better Neural Network Support  Neural Network API was introduced in Android 8.1 Oreo. With the increasing use of  Machine Learning  on  apps  and system itself, the new API will accelerate the Machine Learning and enhance Artificial Intelligence related tasks.

Every new smartphone comes with the better and much-polished capabilities to dethrone the best camera smartphone existing prior to it.  Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus   surpassing the DxOmark benchmark  set by the  Google Pixel 2  is just an example. And Huawei P20 is one of the upcoming smartphones expected to topple those records. The smartphone had been heavily rumored to possess triple cameras at the back. And remarking the rumors as true, Huawei dropped a teaser on its  Twitter handle  hinting a horizontal configuration of the triple cameras at the back. This step has definitely fueled the excitation but has also astonished the fan base, who were tuning to the rumors and expecting a vertical setup of the cameras.   A match made in heaven.

The smartphone giant has also hinted at the inclusion of Artificial Inclusion (AI) in its camera, which has been a buzzword lately.

The devices follow the release of  The Wall and the Q9S  – Samsung’s headline-making TVs at CES 2018. The new lineup of QLED TVs includes the Q6F, Q7F, Q7C (C standing for the curved body), Q8F and Q9F. QLED is derived from Quantum Dot Light Emitting Diode that has quantum dots which can produce different colors depending on the size of the dots that are used. This basically makes the pictures or videos come off with more vibrancy and brightness.  These new QLED TVs from Samsung will now go up against the OLED TVs which have been customers’ pick for some time now. This is partly due to the lack of proper and deep black levels, and the quality of the display while viewing the TVs from the sides in last year’s QLED TVs from Samsung. However, the company has apparently learned from its mistakes and has made the new TVs better, if the voice of other reviewers is considered. Digital Trends writes, “It is starkly apparent Samsung has cracked a code no other TV manufacturer has managed to decipher.”         All TVs have a wide range of sizes as the Q6 comes in a 49-inch to a huge 82-inch of body. Likewise, the Q7F has 55-, 65- and 75-inch screen whereas the Q7C offers 55- and 65-inch displays. Finally, the Q8F has 55-, 65- and 75-inch displays while the flagship TV, the Q9F, comes with 65- and 75-inch display variant.  Here’s the starting price of all the TVs:      Q9F  $3,800    Q8F  $3,000    Q7F  $2,600    Q7C  $2,600    Q6F  $2,200      The best features of these TVs are probably the Ambient Mode that literally makes the TVs “disappears” and the inclusion of Bixby for a voice-controlled device. The Ambient Mode of the TVs can identify the color and texture of the wall it is mounted on and form a picture that looks identical to the background. Likewise, Samsung has included Bixby on the TVs through which you can voice-control what you want the TV to do and also control other devices that are connected inside your house, all-in-all making it the centerpiece of your home. Samsung also confirmed that ‘The Wall’ TV will be available for purchase starting August.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/samsung-qled-tv-lineup.jpg']

Named as Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus, the device was the first  Xiaomi Smartphone  to inherit that trendy design. Now within less than two months of time, the smartphone is now available in Nepal. And all thanks to the Vatsal Impex Pvt. Ltd., the authorized distributor of  Xiaomi products in Nepal , who made it possible.  Also Read:  Xiaomi Mobiles Price in Nepal  Wrapped in an Aluminum body, Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus does not seem much different from a typical Xiaomi smartphone in terms of design. But what contrasts the Redmi 5 Plus from the bunch of the Xiaomi mobiles is the display. Shrinking the bezels on the forehead and the chin, Xiaomi packed a taller 5.99-inch display in nearly same form factor as that of the  Xiaomi MI A1  and the  Redmi Note 4 . In addition to the FullView display, Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus has been another smartphone with the 18:9 aspect ratio, which has come to fashion these days. Furthermore, the display on the smartphone has got the protection of Gorilla Glass on the top to evade the vulnerabilities of cracks and scratches during the falls.        There is Snapdragon 625 chipset to drive the device, which comes coupled with 3/4GB of RAM. In terms of internal storage, the device comes with the variants of 32GB and 64GB. There is also a privilege to expand this amount to 128GB by using a micro SD card. However, there is not a dedicated slot to launch the micro SD card. So one has to sacrifice the SIM2 slot for the SD card. On the software side, the device boots with Android Nougat (v7.1.2) out of the box. There is also the Xiaomi’s home-baked  MIUI 9  on the top to spice things a little more.  On the camera front, there is a 12MP sensor on the back. The rear camera comes with an aperture of f/2.2, 1.25 μm pixel size, and phase detection autofocus. There is also dual-tone flash to inject light while shooting in the dim-lit places. And up front, there is a 5MP front camera to capture the selfies. In terms of sensors, Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus inherits all the basic sensors like Accelerometer, Gyro Sensor, Proximity, and compass sensors. And there is a remarkable 4000 mAh non-removable Li-Po battery to fuel the device.

The device on the top looks elegant with narrow bezels around the borders. But at this price, Xiaomi’s own  Redmi Note 4  and  Xiaomi MI A1  may pose a competition to the device.   Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is now available at the price of Rs. 22,999 (for 3/32GB) and Rs. 25,999 (for 4/64GB). The device possesses pretty much the same specs but with a minor bump of a battery (4100mAh) and the rear camera (13MP). But at the price difference of Rs. 500, choosing a smartphone with the trendy design language over a slightly bigger battery seems a no-brainer.   And there is Xiaomi MI A1. This device does not pack a humongous battery like the Redmi Note 4. MI A1 possesses a rather smaller battery with 3080mAh capacity. However, the smartphone excels in the software and camera department. MI is an Android One device with Stock Android on its system. Being an Android One device, it has blessings from Google for the future OS updates. And talking about the camera, MI A1 is gifted with  Dual-camera setup  on the back. So at the price of Rs. 26,999 (3GB/32GB), you will be able to zoom up to 2x without loss in quality and take portrait shots.

['6 Useful Tips to Reduce Computer Induced Eye Strain'],[],['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['March 5, 2018']",2018-03-05 01:40:12+00:00,"['We are in front of our computers and smartphones all the time. As important as our work is or as enjoyable it is to use these devices, we’ve also got to think things the other way round. There are negative aftermaths of the use of these devices on our physical and mental health that, no matter how much we want, cannot be kept aside.  One of such problems regarding health is what most of us face – the eye strain problem! The problem\xa0of eye strain may include annoyances like eye twitching, red and burning eyes, blurred vision, and headache,g among the others.  If all these sounds familiar, here are a few tips that you can consider to reduce your computer eye strain.        Blink frequently:  The easiest of all tips! Long non- blinking phases cause tears to evaporate\xa0quickly, hence, placing your eyes at a greater risk of dryness. So, let’s consider being a frequent blinker to keep our eyes moist and hydrated.  The 20-20-20 rule:  What this rule asks you to do is,\xa0 look away from your screen. The trick is, for every 20 minutes you spend looking at your computer screen, look away from it towards any object 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This is a very effective exercise that will help reduce visual fatigue.  Use proper lighting:  When using your computers or smartphones try avoiding the use of high-intensity overhead lamps that cast shadows. Also, bright light from outside can cause visual strain. Try using floor lamps which will provide indirect lighting. Similarly, try positioning your screen so that windows are to the side, not in front or behind.  Adjust your display and screen settings:  Make suitable changes to the brightness of your device to match the brightness of your surroundings. Similarly, adjust the text size, try not to make it too small. In regards to contrast, black print on a white background is the most recommended for eye solace. For best results, use a blue light filter, i.e. reduce the color temperature for better viewing comfort.  Consider minimizing glare:  Constant glaring at a screen or any finished surface causes eye strain. For remedying this, you can install an anti-glare screen. Also, if possible, try painting plane or light walls to something darker with a matte finish. This will help reduce eye strain to a whole better level.  Think of getting a nerdy look:  What I mean by this is, try wearing computer eye-wear a.k.a glasses. This actually helps a lot to reduce problems relating to eye strain. Computer glasses help optimize your eyesight while looking at digital screens and helps reduce glare. The use of anti-reflective glasses\xa0will lessen your troubles regarding eye-strain!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/reduce-computer-eye-strain.jpg']

['MWC 2018: Vivo Apex with highest screen to body ratio and In-screen fingerprint sensor launched'],"['MWC 2018', 'Vivo']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['February 28, 2018']",2018-02-28 09:42:33+00:00,"['MWC 2018 has paved the way for bezel-less future showcasing  near bezel-less displays  on every consumer products that come with a display attached. But the bezels are there for a reason as they hold a significant amount of hardware for functionalities. On a smartphone, going bezel-less means finding a different spot for the earpiece, proximity sensor, the ambient light sensor and more importantly the front-facing camera.  Vivo  recently showcased a concept smartphone – the Vivo Apex, which has different tricks up its sleeve to handle the shortcoming of a truly bezel-less smartphone.  Image: Pocket-lint  The Vivo Apex comes with a 6-inch Full HD+ display with 18:9 aspect ratio. It has one of the highest screen to body ratio of almost 96%. On three sides the bezels measure at 1.8mm while on the bottom it’s 4.3mm. Vivo claims the screen to body ratio of 98% can be achieved if it can bring down the bottom bezels to 1.8mm. Even so, the phone looks absolutely stunning with no ugly notch popularized by the  iPhone X.        Also, the use of flexible OLED panel has enabled the manufacturers to fit in a flexible circuit board. So what does it result in? A proximity sensor inside the display that detects whether the phone is idle or picked up. And for the earpiece, Vivo has used Screen SoundCasting Technology which vibrates the display to produce sound. Compared to traditional loudspeakers, this audio solution for bezel-less smartphones conserves power, reduces sound leakage, and optimizes low to high pitch sound for a better and more balanced audio experience.  Image: theverge  Since we are talking about Vivo here – the one that made a huge splash at  CES 2018  with the first on-screen fingerprint sensor (Clear ID) in  Vivo X20 Plus UD . This time, they have incorporated an even larger optic fingerprint sensor on the display. The sensor occupies almost ⅓ of the display meaning you have more freedom on where to place your finger when unlocking the device. With a large sensor, why do you have to be ordinary and use just one finger to unlock the phone right?  Image: Pocket-lint  Well, that’s what Vivo thought and the Apex has been equipped with an option to use two fingers to unlock the device.   With the public’s concern for privacy, the future gadgets seem to be full of hidden cameras. The earlier launched  MateBook X Pro  kept a front facing camera hidden inside a key on the keyboard. Likewise, the new Vivo Apex has an elevating 8MP front facing camera which is hidden inside the phone. When you switch to the front shooter, the camera pops up and takes about 0.8secs to get ready and take a picture. The camera then goes right back in whenever you switch to rear camera or exit from the camera app. In similar fashion, a big LED flash hidden inside the phone can greatly enhance low light selfies as well. Is there a possibility that elevating camera gets stuck due to system lag or error?   On the side of the elevating camera is the ambient light sensor that usually sits along with the proximity sensor.  As you might have noticed from the pictures, the phone has no navigation bar. Well, that seems like another thing in the smartphone that we have to get used to. For navigation, gestures are used like in the  iPhone X . To be more precise, it uses almost all the current gestures of the iPhone X for navigation. The debate of if the back button should be on the left or the right is finally coming to an end on Android!  Vivo Apex also offers headphone jack with dedicated DAC. For DAC it uses Vivo’s new System in Package technology. It eliminates the use of circuit board resulting in more space for battery!  Image: iGyaan  On the rear, the phone sports a glass back and metal frame in between. It also has dual camera setup. Vivo didn’t bother to put an LED flash there since it’s a concept phone.   Bottomline  Vivo has brilliantly showcased unique measures to achieve maximum screen to body ratio without compromising on functionalities. Since it’s a concept phone the choice of internal hardware including CPU and GPU is arbitrary at this point. Then again, it’s a concept device which may or may not\x1b see the light of day in the future. But we can hope to see some of these technologies being implemented on future smartphones.

['MWC 2018: MediaTek Introduces Helio P60 with AI Chip'],[],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['February 28, 2018']",2018-02-28 06:14:02+00:00,"['The hype of Artificial Intelligence is escalating like never before. You see AI integrated into every piece of technology out there. Not to forget the single most technology that we hold dear – smartphones! Our smartphones are already capable of handling AI related functionalities but with the advancement of AI systems, you’ll need a dedicated hardware to accelerate the process and bring out more features. Today MediaTek has introduced the latest SoC under its P Series at MWC – the Helio P60 that comes with a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU).  The Helio P60 is the successor of P30 and has brought a significant amount of changes which explains the jump in number. It uses the ARM big.LITTLE architecture in an octa-core setup with four Cortex A73 cores (big) and four Cortex A53 cores (little) both clocked at 2.0GHz. It is a big upgrade from the P30 as it only used the Cortex A53 cores which is ideal for small tasks compared to Cortex A73 capable of handling heavy jobs.  The new P60 processor with its Cortex A53 and Cortex A73 combination can switch tasks between big and little cores depending on the processing power it requires which makes it more efficient. Adding to the efficiency chart, it is based on 12nm FinFET technology making it one of the most powerful and power efficient chipset in P-Series. This shift has resulted in 70% boost in CPU performance.         This powerful CPU has been coupled with the Mali-G72MP3 GPU clocked at 800MHz. The GPU has improved clock speeds compared to last gen Mali G71-MP2 used on P30. It has a larger L1 cache (on-chip cache) and larger tile memory buffer (image separation into fine tiles) which helps in enhancing the performance. It has several improvements to refine Machine Learning Inference and depicts core functionality of Machine Learning Algorithms. The GPU overall also has 70% improvement.  The feature highlight of Helio P60 is the dedicated NPU with NeuroPilot AI system at work. This enables deep learning facial recognition, object and scene identification,\xa0user behavior-informed performance and other AI and AR application enhancements. It can handle AI operations seamlessly at 280GMAC/s, maintaining twice the power efficiency of GPU-based AI processing. The sole purpose of using a dedicated NPU is to accelerate the AI processes without putting much load on the GPU. The MediaTek’s NeuroPilot SDK supports a vast array of AI frameworks. This makes it easier for developers to bring out AI applications optimized for this hardware.  Coming to the optics support, it can handle a dual camera setup of 20+16MP or a single 32MP sensor. The 32MP sensor can capture full HD videos at 30fps while the use of 16MP sensor will enable 90fps recording. The P60 depth mapping engine that can produce real-time bokeh effect. It uses three Image Signal Processors that equates to 18% power efficiency compared to P30 meaning taking loads of pictures all day won’t be harsh on the battery. It also offers Phase Detection Auto Focus (PDAF), Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), Real-time HDR recording/viewing, face detection, scene detection, and multi-frame noise reduction.  On the connectivity side, the P60 offers dual 4G LTE which ensures both the SIM used are connected to 4G networks.

['Gionee M7 Power Review: High and Dry!'],"['Android', 'Gionee', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 28, 2018']",2018-02-28 05:26:58+00:00,"['The  Gionee M7 Power  has launched at a time when the mid-range price segment is getting more competitive than ever. After months of waiting, Gionee Nepal  launched the device last month . The M7 Power sports an HD display for a price of Rs. 29,999, which could come as a bummer for the buyers. However, with a huge 5,000 mAh battery and a FullView display, the M7 Power certainly stands out from the rest of the crowd. But is battery and design everything the smartphone has to offer? Let’s find out in this review.   Gionee M7 Power Specifications:   6-inch HD+ (1440 x 720) display with 18:9 aspect ratio, 2.5D Glass  Android 7.1 Nougat with Amigo OS 5.0 on top  Hybrid Dual Nano SIM slots, Dual Standby  Fingerprint Sensor (Rear)  1.4GHz octa-core 64-bit Snapdragon 435 processor with Adreno 505 GPU  4GB RAM  13MP Rear Camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, 1080p @30fps  8MP Front Facing Camera  64GB internal storage, expandable up to 256GB  Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Wi-Fi Hotspot, Bluetooth V4.2, micro USB V2.0, USB OTG  5000 mAh Polymer Lithium-Ion battery with Fast Charging (9V/2A)  Price: Rs. 29,999   Battery         The Gionee M7 Power has a huge 5,000 mAh battery which is certainly the USP of the device. The battery coupled with the HD display of the smartphone runs easily for two days straight!  These days, OEMs have started to focus on making their smartphones slimmer than ever. That step has taken a hit on phones’ battery life. But Gionee has managed to do both – pack a massive 5,000 mAh battery in a comparatively thin body. I did compare the Gionee M7 Power’s dimension with other smartphones that house a big battery, and the M7 Power was certainly the star!  The major advantage of having a battery that big is that you can charge other smartphones if you ever happen to run out of power.  Being a battery-focused smartphone, the Gionee M7 Power is meant for a particular user. It is a device which will fulfill of, say, a businessperson who is in need of a secondary smartphone which he won’t have to worry about charging time and again. It is meant for someone who isn’t that into multimedia and gaming but has to make a lot of calls and send lots of texts as the day passes.  Design   One of the interesting features of the Gionee M7 Power is its design. The device’s huge 6-inch form factor is cloaked by a slightly textured aluminum at the back. The M7 Power certainly feels premium on hands and the Chinese manufacturer has done a commendable job by including a huge 5,000 mAh battery in such a sleek body. I was really surprised that Gionee had managed to include a big battery in a comparatively thinner design.  The feature of the Gionee M7 Power’s design is certainly the huge slab of a display up front. The display is sandwiched between minimalistic bezels that make up for an 18:9 aspect ratio in terms of display. There is a secondary camera up top with the primary lens housed at the rear side. The power button and the volume rockers are placed in such a manner that even people with smaller hands can reach them comfortably. However, since the device is a metallic smartphone, it slips – a lot. So, I advise you to cover the back with a case!  Display   The 5,000 mAh battery powers up a 6-inch FullView display of the smartphone. Priced at Rs. 29,999, Gionee could have easily gone with a display with Full HD resolution. However, that’s not the case here as the Gionee M7 Power sports a 720p display. Now I know that the device has focused on providing a display with minimalistic bezels to its users but at a time when even some of the cheaper smartphones have started featuring a 1080p display panel, it is really strange as to why the M7 Power has a HD display.  The M7 Power’s display, with its HD resolution, is certainly bright though. However, if you happen to watch videos on your smartphone, you will notice the difference in quality against, say, the  Huawei Nova 2i , the  Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro  or the  Xiaomi Mi A1 , which are the rivals of the M7 Power in the current Nepali smartphone market.  Performance and Software  The Gionee M7 Power packs an octa-core Snapdragon 435 processor alongside 4 GB of RAM and Adreno 505 GPU. Now I am not saying that the Snapdragon 435 chipset is below par by any means, but for the price tag, Gionee should have at least opted for a Snapdragon 625 chipset or MediaTek Helio P23, which definitely provides a better performance.  Under real-life usage, the Gionee M7 Power does a great job handling all the multitasking needs with its 4 GB RAM. I only faced stutters when I was trying to do too many tasks at once, and that happened very rarely! There were only a couple app crashes, though. Even long sessions of gaming on the device felt really enjoyable with the 6-inch display of the device. The Gionee M7 Power does get warm at the back but that’s nothing to worry about.   Gionee M7 Power Antutu Benchmark  Infogram  On the benchmark side of things, the Gionee M7 Power with its Snapdragon 435 SoC, scored higher than some of its competitors such as the Vivo V7 and the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro on Antutu. However, the Huawei Nova 2i edged out the device by a slight margin. The Xiaomi Mi A1 and the Oppo F5 look like a better option if benchmarks are considered!  Now talking about the software side of things, the Gionee M7 Power runs on Android 7.1 Nougat with Amigo OS 5.0 skin on top. Amigo OS looks like a copy of Apple’s iOS but there are a few features here and there. However, for someone who is into a stock-Android experience, I didn’t enjoy the UI of the device. But unlike the Oppo F5, which focused on blatantly copying iOS, Gionee has included few extra features here and there to make up for a rather different UI. I really liked the shortcuts (eg. Double tap to wake and sleep) the M7 Power offered and don’t really think it’s all gimmicky.  Camera   On the optics department, the Gionee M7 Power houses a 13-megapixel rear-facing and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. Let’s start with the front-facing camera. The selfie camera on the smartphone takes some pretty decent images, but with beautification enabled. The “normal” mode itself beautifies the selfies a little bit, so, personally, I didn’t really dig it.   And maybe the secondary camera could have saturated the pictures a little bit. If you look closely, the selfies from the M7 Power come out with a slightly warmer touch, whose preference depends completely upon a user. Oh, and there is a software-powered portrait mode in the camera which blurs the surrounding of your picture!   The primary camera measuring 13-megapixel is nothing extraordinary. The pictures it takes have good details and a bit a decent color reproduction but failed to maintain a good contrast level. And even this camera captures pictures with a warmer tone which isn’t my cup of tea. And the colors didn’t really pop due to the lack of ample saturation.   During night time, the cameras captured a lot of noise in the images. The color reproduction, which is decent at best during night time, fails to live up to the mark in low-light conditions. It also lacks ample details in the images.   But then again the camera isn’t really what Gionee is focusing in on this smartphone. So, if you are into taking lots of pictures via your smartphone throughout the day, maybe you should look somewhere else.  For more high-quality camera samples of the Gionee M7 Power,  click here .  Hardware   The Gionee M7 Power features 64 GB of onboard memory with an option to expand up to 256 GB. This is an ample storage for anyone who is into saving a lot of videos, movies or audios on their smartphone. On the rear side of the device rests a fingerprint scanner which can unlock the device in an instant. I had no issues with the fingerprint scanner whatsoever.  When we gave the Gionee M7 Power to an audiophile for the review here is what he said about the speaker quality, “However, one thing that really bugged me is the how the bottom firing speaker sounds. Gionee has followed this trend of smartphone manufacturers not focusing on the sound quality of their smartphones’ speakers. Yes, it does get little loud but as an audiophile, I really wasn’t impressed with it.”  Conclusion  Like I said before, the Gionee M7 Power with its price tag goes up against the smartphones of the mid-range price segment which is getting more competitive than ever. If performance, camera, and display are considered, there are already lots of devices that can provide the best of experiences. And for the price of Rs. 29,999, the smartphone isn’t that interesting at all and seems slightly overpriced. So, is the Gionee M7 Power a miss? No, not really. Gionee launched this battery-focused smartphone targeting a particular group of people which mainly consists of businesspersons who are in search of a secondary smartphone.  However, if you don’t fall into that category and want a smartphone that fulfills your performance, multimedia and photography needs, you should look somewhere else. For camera and display purpose, the  Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro  and the  Huawei Nova 2i  seem like a better option, while if you are after performance, you should get the  Xiaomi Mi A1 , or wait for a month and buy the  Xiaomi Redmi 5 Pro .      Pros  Cons    Battery Life  HD Display    Sleek Design  Average performance for price    Minimalistic Bezels  Unsatisfactory camera performance    Ample Storage']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gionee-m7-power-review.jpg']
['MWC 2018: Leagoo S9 “World’s First Android iPhone X” Announced'],"['Android', 'Leagoo', 'MWC 2018']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['February 28, 2018']",2018-02-28 01:57:59+00:00,"['MWC (mobile world congress) this year held in Barcelona experienced a lot of new smartphone ideas for the year 2018. However, there’s something Leagoo, a Chinese phone manufacturer has come up with which is unheard of. Well, Chinese companies never fail to surprise us. Do they?  Leagoo  had tried its fortune in Nepali market last year which was not as successful and a year later, the name is still unheard of to most of us. Following which it paved back its way back from Nepal.  Something that’s the best of both worlds. “World’s First Android iPhone X” is what the company claims it to be. A low-budget combination of two flagship phones. Samsung meets apple. S9 by name and iPhone X by its outlook. A perfect blend of humor and technology. They said, “any publicity is good publicity” and the Leagoo people took it seriously and applied it to their business.        Not just the outlook but it features some other features like the iPhone does. They are: 1. The face access feature which reportedly unlocks within 0.1 second 2. The ‘famous’  iPhone X  notch 3. The iPhone X (swipe up to home) user interface  What does it have in similarity with the  Samsung Galaxy S9  apart from its name? the android Oreo. The Leagoo will also have the android Oreo 8.1. other than that? Nothing really.  Furthermore, if the users are not that fond of face identification unlock system, they will have a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner as well. Now that’s what we call best on both worlds in the actual sense.   On the storage part, 4GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage along with SD card slot is what it consists of. 4GB of RAM is now early 2017 concept but not when we actually come to know about its price.  A 5.85-inch screen with full HD+ IPS display. 3000mAh battery. Dual 13-MP rear cameras and 8 MP front camera are not that bad of a deal.  It boasts an octa-core processor with all cores running at 1.5GHz. Well, how smooth the processing is will be examined once the phone launches. As far as the specification shows, the processor will be pretty decent as well.  Lastly, this phone will be priced at US$ 150 (approx Rs 15,500).  Therefore, comparing its features with the price which is quite affordable, the phone might have high chances of being a gimmick. Let’s hope this presumption will be proven by the phone. Whether or not will it be perceived by the public as “World’s First Android iPhone X” as the company claims or not is a question that has been making rounds inside our heads.  Leagoo is to launch yet another smartphone this year. It is named power 5. While most of the specifications are not known some of which we know is the 7000 mAh big battery and 18:9 bezel-less display.  Leagoo S9 Specifications:   Display: 5.85-inch Full HD+ IPS  OS: Android Oreo 8.1  Back Camera: 13MP + 2MP Dual (Sony)  Front Camera: 8MP (Omni Vision)  Sensor: fingerprint, face unlock  Processor: octa-core 1.5 GHz (unnamed)  RAM: 4GB  Storage: 32GB; microSD support  Battery: 3300mAh  Price: US$150 (Rs. 15,500)   For More MWC 2018 Coverage Click Here!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/leagoo-S9.png']

They do make pretty compelling laptops, with the best of all, the Yoga series. At  MWC 2018 , they have launched two new Yoga laptops namely the Yoga 730 and 530.  Lenovo Yoga 730  The Yoga 730 is available in either a 13″ or a 15″ variant. They come with either a Full HD\xa0or an Ultra HD (4K) IPS panel with a maximum brightness of around 300 nits. Lenovo didn’t reveal any color coverage numbers, but it’s up there with the best. Also, these laptops are touch and feature 360-degree hinges.  Both the laptops come with 8th gen intel core i5 or i7 processors. The laptops are available with up to 16GB of DDR4 RAM alongside up to\xa01TB of flash storage on the 15″ laptop. The 13″ however only gets a maximum of 500GB of flash storage.        Also Read: MWC 2018: ZTE launches Blade V9 and V9 Vita  On the graphics front, the smaller 13″ gets an Intel 620 graphics card. The bigger one, however, gets up to a Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics card, which is optional. Thanks to the same GTX 1050, the 15″ model is a bit thicker and understandably heavier.  The Yoga 730 features a premium all-aluminum design, just like the 720 but a bit better. The top edge is slanted rather than flat, which Lenovo says helps with one hand usage. The 13″ weights in at 1.12kgs whereas the 15″ come out a bit heavy at 1.89kgs.   Lenovo claims a battery life of 11.5 hours for the 13″ and 11 hours for the 15″. These numbers are for the FHD based displays. The battery life with the UHD display comes out at 9 hours.\xa0These laptops also feature rapid charging which provides 2 hours of usage with just 15 mins of charging.  The bigger variant is packed with two full-sized USB A, HDMI, USB C, charging port and a headphone jack. The smaller variant gets a pair of USB C, headphone jack and a full-sized USB A port.\xa0The smaller one also uses a USB C to charge whereas the bigger one employs a Lenovo proprietary port for charging.  Both the laptops come with Amazon Alexa built-in, aided by four microphones. The microphone helps with better voice commands even in a fully crowded noisy room. Expanding on the design a bit, the laptop features a very minimal bezel display. Just like on the XPS lineup, but with the webcam on top.

The Pen 2 comes with 4096 levels of sensitivity and is priced at $69.99. The laptops also come with Windows 10 and Windows Hello fingerprint reader.  The laptops will go on sale starting April this year, although exact dates are yet to be announced. Pricing starts at  $879 for the 13″  and  $899 for the 15″ variant  and will exponentially rise if you decide to go for dedicated graphics options.  Lenovo Yoga 530 (Flex 14)  The Lenovo Yoga 530, also known as Flex 14 in the US is the affordable one among the two. It’s only available in 14″ variant, with a plastic build and the same 360 degrees and stylus support perfect for students. It also weighs in at just 1.6Kgs so portability won’t be an issue either.   The Flex does come with 8th Gen Intel processors, with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD. It does lack Alexa and the display caps out at FHD, with about 60-70% of color coverage. With the low res display, Lenovo claims about 10 hours of battery life.  On the graphical side, you can bump up to an MX150 dedicated graphics card with 4GB of DDR5 memory. Port-wise it features both USB A and a USB Type C alongside a full-size HDMI port.\xa0The laptop will go on sale sometime in the middle of April with a starting price of  $549 .

Nevertheless, they have yet to give up on the business. At the  MWC 2018 , the Japanese manufacturer launched two new smartphones, the Sony Xperia XZ2 and the XZ2 Compact.  Sony has clearly put a lot of effort into making these smartphones. And we can clearly see their R&D team’s hard work at full glory here. These new devices flaunt a totally new and much-needed design language, and Sony calls it the “Ambient Flow” design.  Sony Xperia XZ2  Starting off with the Xperia XZ2, it sports a 5.7-inch FHD+ 18:9 aspect ratio display with Gorilla Glass 5 protection. On the inside, it features the  Snapdragon 845 SoC  with just 4GB of RAM and 64GB of UFS. It also comes paired with the new Adreno 630 GPU and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. What it does not come with is a headphone jack.        The highlight here is the “Ambient Flow” design, with curved edges, arching backs, and a 2.5D Gorilla Glass back, which makes it capable of wireless charging. And yes, this is the first and the only Sony smartphone capable of wireless charging till date. The new design does keep a lot of features from the “Loop face” and “Omni\xa0balance” concepts while still putting out a completely fresh\xa0new design.  The XZ2 shares the same camera sensors with the last generation’s Xperia XZ1. It’s a 19MP 1/2.3″ Sony IMX400 camera with a f/2.0 aperture. The camera is packed with predictive hybrid laser/phase detection/contrast AF, burst AF, IR sensor for white balance, LED flash, dedicated hardware shutter key and BIONZ for a mobile image-processing engine.   All these features help with better color rendition, detail reproduction and noise handling in low light. The smartphone is also capable of 4K HDR recording and 960fps@1080p. At the front, there is a 5MP f/2.2 camera with EIS capable of up to\xa01080p video recording.  The Xperia XZ2 comes with a 3180mAh battery, Bluetooth 5.0, USB 3.1 Type-C, an 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Android 8.0 Oreo. The device is also IP65/IP68 certified dust and water resistance for better protection. The Sony XZ2 will be available in Liquid Black, Liquid Silver, Deep Green, and Ash pink color options.  Sony Xperia XZ2 Specifications   Display : 5.7 inches IPS LCD with Gorilla glass 5 (front and back) protection  Resolution : 1080*2160 pixels, 18:9 aspect ratio  OS : Android Oreo 8.0  Chipset : Snapdragon 845  RAM : 4GB  Storage : 64 internal storage, Expandable up to 256GB (Uses SIM2 slot)  Rear Camera : 19MP, f/2.0, EIS, laser autofocus, LED flash  Front Camera : 5 MP, f/2.2  Connectivity : Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, A-GPS, 3G, 4G LTE, USB Type C 3.1 reversible connector  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer  Battery: \xa03180mAh non-removable battery  Color Variants : Liquid Black, Liquid Silver, Deep Green, Ash pink   Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact  The XZ2 Compact is a bit different from the regular sized XZ2. It’s has a 5-inch\xa0FHD 16:9 minimum bezel display design. It also comes with the same Gorilla Glass 5 protection at the front. However, the back isn’t glass so wireless charging isn’t available for this one alongside no headphone jack. On the inside, the smartphone features the same Snapdragon 845 SoC paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of UFS.   Almost all the aspects of the phone are identical to the 5.7 inch Xperia XZ2 including the 19MP back and 5MP front cameras. The only aspects that are different are the smaller 2870mAh battery and the slight design variations of the smartphones. This particularly small but very capable phone will be available in\xa0Black, White Silver, Moss Green, and Coral Pink color options.

Basically, the device responsible for vibration is a bit more noticeable than other average smartphones. The special feature here is, Sony has an algorithm in place that processes the audio output and vibrates the phone at appropriate moments to enhance the audio experience. We do not know how well this works, but it is a feature nevertheless. Also, the loudspeakers itself are 20% louder than before.  So, what do you think about the new Sony flagship for 2018? There is no question that these are very capable smartphones and can even compete with the  Samsung Galaxy S9  if marketed correctly. The XZ2 compact is definitely the device to get if you want a small sized smartphone and the bigger XZ2 is also not that bad. The question now is how much importance will Sony gives these two new smartphones and how good their availability is going to be.

['MWC 2018: Huawei unveiles 3 variants of Mediapad M5 Tablet'],"['Huawei', 'MWC 2018']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['February 26, 2018']",2018-02-26 14:25:31+00:00,"['Unlike smartphones, the tablet market is going down hills. At one point, aimed to be a truly mobile handheld computing device to replace heavy laptops, these days, tablets are considered to be an obsolete tech to be used as a multimedia station for entertainment. At the time where the only true tablet is considered as the iPad, on MWC 2018, we saw Huawei leveling up its tablet game with the launch of high-end Huawei Mediapad M5. The tablet comes in three different variants, namely, MediaPad 8.4, MediaPad 10.8 and MediaPad Pro.  All of these three tablets come with a 2K display and curved screen. They are made of unibody metal construct to give a premium feel to it. Giving life to them is EMUI 8 on top of Android 8.0 Oreo.  Huawei MediaPad M5 8.4         Huawei MediaPad 8.4, like the name suggests, comes with an 8.4-inch display. If you want a portable tablet to indulge in multimedia consumption then it is perfect for carrying. If you want a stationary multimedia station that stays in your home, office or room then you may want to consider the bigger 10.8-inch variant.  Whatever the screen size may be, you will be able to watch HDR content on all the variants. Being the base variant, it sure has some drawbacks compared to its bigger siblings. Mediapad M5 8.4 only offers dual Harman Kardon speakers instead of quad setup on 10.8 variants. But all of the models feature Huawei’s Histen surround sound technology for a more immersive experience. The small size also means a relatively smaller battery size – 5100mAh to be exact. Nonetheless, it offers full HD video playback of up to 11 hours. With Quick Charge, you can juice it up within 2 hours.   The tablet is powered by Kirin 960 – \xa0Huawei’s last-gen flagship chipset. It is coupled with 4GB of RAM. So this device is no slump even if you want to do some heavy gaming. The 8.4-inch variant offers two storage options – 32GB and 64GB. It offers a 13MP rear camera with f/2.2 aperture and 8MP front camera with the same aperture. Tablet cameras are usually terrible but the ones in MediaPad M5 looks promising.

The perk of having a bigger display is having two extra speakers – a quad speaker setup on the tablet for an immersive surround sound for media consumption. Not to forget, it also supports HDR content.  Powering the MediaPad 10.8 is the Kirin 960 chipset coupled with 4GB of RAM. Three storage options are available for the tablet – 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB with no support for expansion. On the optics front, it carries the same 13MP rear and 8MP front setup.

The stylus comes with 4096-layer pressure sensitivity for different tilting and shading functions. The pen comes inside the box so no need to buy it separately. It carries a USB C port for charging which can be shown and hidden by twisting the cap of the pen. The tablet would be a great pick for digital artists who want to hone their craft on the go.

To give break from smartphone monotony, Huawei has unveiled a super sleek ultrabook – \xa0the Matebook X Pro. It is an upgrade from the last year’s Huawei Matebook X. The design of the product has been inspired from the MacBook lineup along with the naming convention. This laptop is an eye candy with 91% screen to body ratio which is the highest in any laptop. Despite sleek looks, it also has some stealthy tricks up its sleeve.  Matebook X Pro is a 14-inch laptop with 3K resolution (3000 x 2000) and pixel density of 256 PPI. Packing a lot of pixels, it offers sharp and vivid picture quality. This panel scores 100% on the sRGB color accuracy test so you are in for an unmatched visual experience. The display is bright at 450 nits for good visibility outdoors. It has super slim bezels measuring 4mm on all the four sides. Unlike other bezel-less displays, it lacks the thick chin where the webcam is located. The build quality and the minimal bezels sure give the XPS lineup run for their money.         Matebook X Pro has a neat little trick for the webcam. Among the function key row, a press of a button will reveal the 1MP webcam hidden underneath that key. \xa0Simply pressing the key will again hide the camera on to the keyboard. This is one way of getting rid of a thick chin for a below-par web cam. But the angle of webcam sure seems weird from the position of the keyboard. Also no more tapes on your webcam for security. Another neat feature is the fingerprint sensor on the power button which is now a standard with the premium laptops.   Coming to the internals, it offers Intel 8th Gen Core i5 or i7. The RAM can be maxed out up to 16GB from base 8GB. Also, the solid storage can be bumped up to 512GB from base 256GB. You can opt for Nvidia MX 150 GPU whose performance is comparable to the desktop GT 1030. It’s a budget graphics card making it not that powerful and power hungry at the same time which makes it ideal for ultrabooks. It should provide enough horsepower to do lightweight photo and video editing along with decent gaming at low settings. To make the multimedia experience richer, it offers Dolby Atmos speakers.   Coming to the I/O, the Matebook X Pro offers a full-size USB A port along with two USB C ports. Both the USB C Ports supports Thunderbolt 3, data transfer and charging. It also has a headphone jack but lacks an SD Card slot. Overall, the I/O on this laptop is satisfactory and you won’t have to adopt the dongle lifestyle.  Also Read:\xa0 Apple MacBook price in Nepal  With 1.33KG weight and 14.6mm thickness, it is extremely portable. The Matebook X Pro is more like a business laptop that prioritizes on aesthetics and usability with a decent amount of power.

It is somewhat an exciting period where a lot of new technology, specifically smartphones gets revealed. With such enthusiasm, Nokia has launched 3 new smartphones on the event. This includes the very first Nokia phone with tall 18:9 aspect ratio –  Nokia 7 Plus  and one of the first  Android Go Phones  – Nokia 1. Apart from them, the enhanced version of  Nokia 8  – \xa0the Nokia 8 Sirocco has also been introduced. So let’s look at each of these devices and see what they have in store for us.  Nokia 7 Plus   The tall 18:9 aspect ratio display was the buzz of 2017 and it is here to stay and become more of a standard in 2018. Nokia has surely missed the hype last year, but this year, it is starting out early with the launch of Nokia 7 Plus. It is the very first phone from Nokia to sport a tall 18:9 aspect ratio. Although the 6-inch FHD+ display has not so minimal bezels on top and bottom giving it a Pixel 2-esque\xa0but lacks the stereo speakers up front utilizing those areas. The display offers 500 nits of brightness which is ideal for working on direct sunlight.        Unlike the Pixel, it is a midrange phone that gets the homogeneous treatment with the inclusion of Snapdragon 660 chipset coupled with 4GB of RAM. The phone offers latest in techs like Bluetooth 5.0 and Quick Charge 4.0 support. Midrange phones sure are going to be more competitive in 2018.  The unibody aluminium construct with ceramic-like feel makes the phone a premium choice on the budget segment. Holding a position on the rear are the dual 12MP+13MP lenses with f/1.7 and f/2.6 aperture respectively. The assisting lens help in capturing portrait shots. Below the shooters resides a fingerprint sensor. Up front, it carries a 16MP camera, unfortunately with no LED flash.   For storage, Nokia 7 Plus offers 64GB onboard storage with the option for expandability up to 256GB. This phone runs on Android 8.0 Oreo. Backing it up is a 3800mAh battery which according to Nokia provides two days of battery backup.  Nokia 7 Plus Specifications:   Display:  6″ IPS LCD full HD+ (2160 x 1080, 18:9), Corning Gorilla Glass 3  Storage : 64 GB eMMC 5.1, expandable up to 256 GB  Operating System : Android 8.0 Oreo  CPU:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 660  RAM:  4GB LPDDR4  Rear Camera:  12 MP 1.4µm f/1.75 2PD with ZEISS optics, 13 MP 1.0µm f/2.6 with ZEISS optics, dual-tone flash  Front Camera:  16 MP with ZEISS optics  Connectivity : 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac WiFI, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS/AGPS+GLONASS+BDS, NFC, 3.5 mm headphone jack  Sensors:  Ambient light sensor, Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, E-compass, Gyroscope, Fingerprint Sensor, Hall sensor  Cable type:  USB Type-C (USB 2.0)  Battery:  3800 mAh battery  Price : $490.55   Nokia 8 Sirocco   Nokia 8 Sirocco is the upgraded version of the last year’s Nokia 8. The phone has been more polished with the new design overhaul and spec changes. Nokia 8 Sirocco is 95% glass with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and the back. Sandwiched between them is a stainless steel frame for rigidity. With glass back, the phone supports wireless charging. It is also IP68 water and dust resistant.  The screen has been bumped up to 5.5 inches from 5.3 inches with the same 2K resolution. The display uses pOLED panel instead of the IPS. Although the aforementioned mid-range Nokia 7 Plus comes with tall 18:9 display, the flagship Nokia 8 Sirocco comes with the old 16:9 aspect ratio. This is a major letdown of the device and could pull back Nokia once again for not adapting to the changing consumer demand. However, removal of headphone jack surely shows its catching up.  Also Read:  Nokia Mobiles Price in Nepal (Official Prices)  Powering the device is the same old Snapdragon 835 while we are expecting the new SD 845 in all of the flagship launches in 2018. It is coupled with 6GB of RAM. Where Nokia hasn’t compromised is with the storage. Providing a single storage option for 128GB and microSD expansion support, you can easily store media to your heart’s content.   Nokia 8 Sirocco showcases dual camera setup in a pair of 12MP+13MP that extends 2X optical zoom. It offers spatial audio that utilizes three integrated microphones to provide a high dynamic range of 24-bit audio and the ability to record at up to 132 decibels. This means crystal-clear and distortion-free audio even at the most deafening concerts or events while recording video. Not to forget, it can shoot 4K @30fps. Upfront, it bags 5MP camera which is a downgrade in numbers from the 13MP of Nokia 8.  Nokia 8 Sirocco comes with a non-removable Li-Ion 3260 mAh battery. It also offers the latest Quick Charge 4.0 charging standard.

At MWC we saw quite a few launches of the Android GO devices including one from Alcatel and ZTE. Nokia is big in the budget segment so they have introduced Nokia 1 with Android Go as well. Android Go OS is aimed at truly budget smartphones for developing nations where data packs are expensive and connectivity is poor. In such, Go apps will truly revolutionize how people will connect with the world.   The phone sports a 4.5-inch display with 480p resolution. Design-wise, the phone has a curved rounded body with a soft touch removable polycarbonate back. Nokia is going all in with different colors and funky patterns on the back which they termed as “Xpress-on covers.” It is IP52 drip proof.   It packs a 5MP rear camera and 2MP front-facing camera.

['MWC 2018: Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus with Dual Aperture Cameras and AR Emojis announced'],"['MWC 2018', 'Samsung']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 26, 2018']",2018-02-26 01:37:55+00:00,"['Mobile World Congress or the  MWC 2018  kicked from February 25. And in this biggest show of the mobile technology,  Samsung  announced its new flagship handsets, Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Due to the frequent  leaks, rumors, and speculations , the smartphone had created quite a buzz lately.  [Update: Samsung Nepal has launched the S9 and S9 Plus in Nepal. The price of S9 in Nepal is  Rs. 87,900  and the price of S9 Plus is  Rs. 99,900 . Find out the prebooking offer here  in this link. ]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_-NKRVn7IQ        Camera Reimagined  Lately, Samsung had been advertising these new flagship handsets to possess an awe-inspiring potential in the camera department. Shouting “Camera Reimagined” on several occasions, the smartphone giant had genuinely hyped the photography caliber of the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 plus. And to everyone’s surprise, the Korean giant introduced the unique dual-aperture cameras in the newbies. With this feature, users can change the aperture of the camera and adjust the amount of light while taking the shots.  Samsung has boasted that this feature is to provide flexibility to the cameras so that it can capture superior shots in every lighting condition. The presenters also mentioned that this feature helps to embrace enhanced visibility and sharpness in the images irrespective of the lighting condition. The 12MP camera on the Samsung Galaxy S9 has a dual aperture that can be switched from f/1.5 to f/2.4 aperture. The f/2.4 aperture can be used if there is adequate light and shallow depth of field is not required. Likewise, the wide aperture of f/1.5 can be employed to take shots during the low lights.   Unlike the last year’s  Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 plus , there is a slight difference between Galaxy S9 and S9+. Last year’s flagship handsets used single camera setup with same sensors and lens. However, in the case of Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+, there is a slight discrimination amongst the siblings. The smaller device or the Galaxy S9 possesses a single 12MP camera with f/1.5 – f/2.4 aperture and OIS. But its bigger sibling inherits a  dual camera setup  on the back. The dual camera setup of 12MP on the plus variant inherits the combination of telephoto and wide-angle lens. With this setup, in addition to nifty portrait shots, the smartphone can capture images with 2x lossless optical zooming.  To add more, the newbies come with “Super speed Dual Pixel” technology. It combines the dual pixel technology that was introduced with the S7 series and adds dedicated processing and memory to enable multi-frame noise reduction using 12 separate images per photo you shoot. And there is a dedicated DRAM built into the sensor, due to which the handsets would be able to stitch all those images together quickly. And resulting in hardly any delay between pressing the shutter button and the picture showing up. With this technology, Samsung aspires to reduce to reduce the amount the noises and grains in the images when shot during the low light scenarios.   The device also comes with Super Slow-Mo feature, with which users can capture the videos/clips at an insanely slow frame rate. With this feature, users can take HD videos (1280 x 720 pixels) at 960fps and Full HD videos at 240 fps. With this feature, a recording of 0.2 seconds can result in the slow-mo video clip of 6 seconds.  Security  Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus were criticized for its awkward fingerprint placement throughout the year. Back then, those flagship handsets had the fingerprint sensor next to the camera, which often invited smudges on the camera. However, this time around Samsung has shifted the fingerprint scanner just below the camera. At this new position, the camera does not suffer from the unintentional smudge when trying to unlock the device. To add an extra layer of security to the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+, the Korean giant also provided “Intelligent Scan” feature to the handsets. Basically, the “Intelligent Scan” feature incorporates Iris Scanner, which combines with the face recognition feature to provide top-notch security.   According to the representatives of the Samsung, the iris scanner won’t work as effectively in bright light as it is in the dark. With the new system, these galaxy phones will try to sign you in with your eyes by default, but when that fails, it will use facial recognition.  AR Emojis  Animoji feature in the  iPhone X  was a huge hit. Mapping the users’ faces and tracking the facial movements, the Animoji feature on the iPhone X was used to replicate the movement via funny characters. And probably impressed with this noteworthy feature, Samsung brought the similar feature known as “AR Emojis”. This feature maps the user’s face and builds a character who has almost similar face details like the user but in a cartooned form. The attributes of the user’s skin complexion and dress are also customizable. Furthermore, this feature allows the user to add spectacles and adjust hairstyle so that a character with a close resemblance to the user can be obtained.  Improved Bixby and Bixby Vision 2.0  Samsung first launched its AI assistant in the S8 and the S8 plus. With Google Assistant and Siri already the major player in the game, Samsung’s home-baked AI assistant received numerous criticisms. All the criticism were for the lack of smartness like the aforementioned duo. However, this time, Samsung has added a lot of features to the Bixby and the Bixby vision was improved greatly.  Now with the Bixby vision 2.0, users can translate the language in real time just by capturing the image in the Bixby Vision. Additionally, there is Makeup mode, which lets you try out make on your face virtually in the real time. If the makeup comes to your liking, you can also shop the makeup goodies right through your smartphone. However, this feature is limited to only a few countries.  AKG tuned stereo Speakers  The Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus also inherit the AKG tuned stereo speakers. With the new kind of speaker setup, S9 and S9+ have been Galaxy smartphone with loudest audio level. Presenters were quite proud to mention that with the Dolby Atmos powered speakers, this handset can produce cinematic sound to mobile devices. In the event, Samsung also boasted that this setup would provide an immersive sound in the 3D environment.  Brighter Display  In terms of display, there are no such significant enhancements. Like the S8 and S8 plus duo, the newbies come in the same size of 5.8 inches and 6.2 inches respectively. However, the bezels on the device have been slightly shrunken, which results in slightly more screen-to-body ratio. Additionally, the brightness of the device has also been upsurged from 600 nits to 700 nits.   Powerful Processor  Powering the device is  Snapdragon 845 chipset , which will be available in the market of China and USA. For the Middle East, Europe and Africa, the device will come with Exynos 9810 chipset. With these new chipsets on the house, the handsets ensure 25% boost in general performance, 30% boost in graphics performance, 30% lower power consumption, and improved image processing over its predecessors. And these powerful yet power efficient 10nm chipsets are backed by 4GB of Ram on the S9, whereas the S9+ is gifted with a whopping 6GB. The devices come with 64GB of onboard storage and there are additional 128GB and 256GB variants who crave for higher internal memory.

['Dell Vostro 5468 Review: Business cum productivity Laptop'],"['Dell', 'Reviews', 'Vostro Series']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['February 24, 2018']",2018-02-24 13:45:31+00:00,"['The Vostro 5000 series is among the latest, affordable and handy laptops from Dell. The Dell Vostro 5468 is one of those portable and lightweight laptops from Dell intended for business purposes. In this review, we will see if the Dell Vostro 5468 performs in real life.  Dell Vostro 5468 specifications in a nutshell:   Display: 14″ FHD display  RAM: 4GB DDR3  Hard disk capacity: 1TB with expandable SSD  Operating system: Windows 10  Processor series: Core-i5  Processor number: i5-7200U  Graphics: Intel 620 shared graphics along with a dedicated Nvidia 940 MX graphics    Design  Since the device is impressive at first sight, I will elaborate on the design first. TheDell Vostro 5468 has a simple and generic design. The Dell Vostro 5468 measures in at 14 inches accompanied by a stylish design and sleek looks.         The device is pretty light at just 1.5 kg, making it very easy to carry around. The Grey metallic chassis makes it look premium and attractive.   The power button lies in the top right corner, which has an LED indicator to show if the power is on. The trackpad is also pretty decent with good tracking and gestures for scrolling, switching through tasks and the like.   The right side has an SD card slot, a USB 3.0 port, a VGA port and Similarly, the left side is equipped with two USB 3.0 ports, a gigabit Ethernet, an HDMI and a charging port. Well, it’s clear that the connectivity options this device provides are quite impressive.     Adding more to the design, the keys are placed at a good and comfortable distance from each other making it easier for the users to type in it. This is good news for the students and business people who have to type a lot.   The keys feel comfortable while typing, so long time of typing is also made easier by the arrangement of the keys. In the overall design department, I would definitely give this one a thumbs up.  Display  The Dell Vostro 5468 comes with a Full HD matte display which is indeed bright with sufficient enough contrast and saturation. Although the display quality and colour reproduction are good, the viewing angles are not very impressive.   The display quality is good while watching movies and videos, so I’ve had my share of movie experience while using this laptop. Similarly, viewing images in the 1080p display yields good results. The contents are visible under sunlight too, so even working outdoors isn’t a problem with this one.  Battery  One of the major concerns for me as a user, be it on any device, is the battery. There are times when you forget to carry your charger around and you have a hard time doing your tasks steadily. It gives you around 5 hours of life once fully charged.  The around 5 hours scenario is applicable only in conditions of normal usage. While playing videos it gave me a life of 4 hours exactly, so I was able to finish 2 movies without plugging the charger in. Similarly, while I played Battlefield for an hour, the battery drained significantly and then left me with around 2 hours of time for normal use. Overall, the battery life, I must say, is quite good.  Storage  Next thing is the storage. The version I am currently using has 4 GB of RAM and 1TB of Hard Drive. You can always install an SSD with its vacant M.2 Slot. If you are a content creator, adding an SSD would be a wise choice.\xa0 You also have 1 free ram slot in case you need more memory. So, you have the choice to get more memory for your device when you need it, as the device gives you a choice. The system can grow with your needs.  Performance  The Dell Vostro 5468 is powered by a dual-core 7 th  generation processor that runs at a base clock of 2.5 GHz and can go high up to 2.7 GHz. The CPU is accompanied by Intel’s 620 shared graphics and a dedicated Nvidia 940 MX graphics card for better performance. If you will be using this one for gaming, you would certainly want to play at medium to low settings. But, as this device is not made for gaming purposes, this was expected.  For the price, Multitasking is also quite good as running multiple programs does not slow down the computer and also switching between tasks is smooth and fast. What’s commendable is, switching from games to other tasks also has a smooth outcome. So, you won’t have to worry about your device freezing while aggressively switching from one task to another. The Dell Vostro 5468 does great for multitasking without interruption.  As far as throttling is concerned, the device holds up pretty well in normal usage. The only times I felt the device get warm was when I started gaming, although it’s pretty normal in most of the laptops while in the gaming scenario.  Also Read:  Dell Laptops Price in Nepal \xa0  As I already said, visuals look good on this device which is further aided by good sound quality from two speakers located below at both right and left sides. I am among the people who prefer the speakers to be located up and not on the laptop. That, however, does not necessarily mean the audio output from this device is not good. The speakers are loud enough and the audio is well balanced, considering the small size. additionally, the built-in webcam allows you to collaborate with your business partners easily.  Other things being said, this device is marketed for business purposes, for instance, using MS Office, handling your social life and the like. Notable is the fact that this one is more than just that. Gaming, in particular, was not bad at medium to low settings and it definitely can be used as an entertainment device as well. The insides of this device are up to date and powerful enough to run anything you could need for a business user. the 7 th  Gen processor will run anything you throw at it and the SSD will follow with similar performance.  Verdict  In conclusion, The Dell Vostro 5468 definitely serves the needs it was built for that is for on-the-go business workers who have a modest budget. For a normal user like myself, who does more office related works, wide range of entertainment activities and a little bit of gaming, the device fares well for the price.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Dell-Vostro-5468-Review.jpg']

This is the second time that the Xiaomi Mi 5 is getting a price drop. The device was launched earlier in 2016 and was priced at Rs. 50,000. The first price drop lowered the price to Rs. 39,999. Now the phone is available for a discounted price of Rs. 33,999. In a similar manner, the Mi 5S and the Mi 5S Plus, which were launched in 2016, have also seen a decrease in their offer price. The Xiaomi Mi 5S is now available for Rs. 36,999 instead of the initial offering of Rs. 48,999. Likewise, Rs. 39,999 is the updated pricing for the Xiaomi Mi 5S plus, which previously was sold for Rs. 52,999.  The Xiaomi Mi5, Mi 5S and Mi 5S plus were launched by Xiaomi as their flagship smartphone around two years back.        Similarly, Xiaomi has launched two phones with impressive specs in 2018 (Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro) which, even though are not of flagship-grade, seem quite impressive\xa0specs-wise.

For us girls, there is an ultimate need to make sure the pictures look pretty, because, hello, we cannot post ugly photos of us! There are solutions to this problem in forms of photo editing apps but the options for editing are so limited and the edit quality is not very good.

['Gionee S11 Lite with FullView Display and Dual Camera Launched in Nepal'],['Gionee'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['February 21, 2018']",2018-02-21 17:57:21+00:00,"['After the launch of the  Gionee M7 Power , the Chinese manufacturer  Gionee  has launched another new smartphone in Nepal, dubbed the Gionee S11 Lite. It was one of the  eight smartphones  that launched back in November last year.  The Gionee S11 Lite features a 5.7 inch 18:9 FullView display with a resolution of 1440 x 720 pixels. Gionee has decided to use a Snapdragon 430 SoC inside paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. All this is aided by a 3030mAh battery to keep the lights on.  One of the main highlights here is the 16MP camera up front, which claims to take really good selfies. We will have to test it to confirm it, but on paper, it seems decent. Also, there is a  dual camera setup  with a 13MP and 2MP lens combo at the back. Needless to say, we are very optimistic about its cameras.        Connectivity wise, they still employ the traditional Micro USB for charging and data transfers. The fingerprint lives on the back of the smartphone alongside the cameras. And while we are on the subject, it’s a plastic back, which was a bummer, to be honest.   Other features include a built-in app lock, private space 2.0, smart eye protection, split screen, game mode, fingerprint shortcuts, app clone and more. So, tell us what you think about this new smartphone from Gionee. Is\xa0this a good enough device or does Gionee needs to try even harder to win it’s fans back?  Gionee S11 Lite Specifications   Display: \xa05.7 inches IPS LCD HD+ FullView display with 18:9 aspect ratio  OS: \xa0Android v7.1 Nougat with Amigo 5.0 on the top  Chipset:\xa0 Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 430  CPU:  Octa-core up to 1.4GHz  GPU:\xa0 Adreno 505  RAM: \xa04GB  Onboard Storage: \xa032GB  Front camera: \xa016MP, f/2.0 aperture  Rear camera: \xa013MP + 2MP, f/2.2 aperture, autofocus, LED flash  Fingerprint Sensor : Yes  Other Features:\xa0 Fingerprint scanner, 3D Photo, Private Space  Battery: \xa03030 mAh Non-removable battery  Color Options : Gold, Black   Gionee S11 Lite Price In Nepal:  Despite the plastic back, the Gionee S11 Lite looks appealing with the glossy finish. The  near bezel-less design  has also added elegance to the device. In addition, the presence of dual camera setup seems to pack an assuring potential in the photography department. And for all such features, the smartphone is asking a price of Rs. 25,999.  Considering the price, the smartphone is clearly overpriced for its features. An HD+ display at the price of Rs. 25,999 is the real bummer. The pixel density of 282PPI may not sound that diverting, but if the price is taken into consideration, it does not seem right. Since almost all the smartphones at the similar price range have employed a display with Full-HD resolution, picking such low-res display makes no sense at all. At the price of Rs. 26,990 (but available at Rs. 24,999), you can get Gionee’s last year’s flagship the  Gionee A1 . Gionee A1 comes with the vibrant AMOLED display with Full-HD resolution. And choosing the Gionne A1 over the S11 Lite seems a wise choice to me.   Gionee had been quite obsessed with the MediaTek processors in the past. And the customers were frequently unimpressed with the move. This time around, the smartphone brand has gone with the Octa-core Snapdragon processor. But despite the transition, there is nothing much to brag about since the chipset used is lower mainstream SoC fabricated in 28nm architecture. So if you are into performance, Xiaomi MI A1 would be a better choice as it comes with Snapdragon 625 chipset. Snapdragon 625 is a powerful yet power-efficient\xa0chipset. And coupled with the 4GB of RAM, the MI A1is ensures buttery smooth performance.\xa0Priced at Rs. 26,999 (4GB/32GB, Available for Rs. 25,000), the smartphone also carries dual camera setup at the back with the potential to capture images with 2x lossless zooming.   FullView display and near bezel-less display may be another highlight of the Gionee S11 lite. But at a lower price than the S11 Lite, users can get the  Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus \xa0(Rs. 23,499) with the similar near bezel-less display at the size of 5.99 inches.

Their products are used worldwide. They manufacture quite a variety of electronics one of which are smartphones.  If rumors are to be believed, LG is all set to come up with a new smartphone to be released under its  ‘G’  series.  The new phone will be a follow-up to the  LG G6  which was launched last year. Despite the excellence in performance G6 was overshadowed because of the competition.        Evan Blass,  who is known for credible leaks, has leaked some information regarding an upcoming LG flagship phone. The phone is to release in June this year. The smartphone is codenamed  ‘Judy’ . From what we understand, and after considering its specs, this device is probably the LG G7.  Supposedly, the device will have an MLCD+ display which apparently is brighter than standard  IPS LCD  screens. We would not need to increase the brightness while out in the sun. This means an increase in battery life. Oh, and the battery consumption will be lowered by 35 percent.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 LG G7 Rumored Design.  The display will be of  18:9  aspect ratio with the screen standing  6.1-inch  tall. The length of the phone might not sound practical enough but the narrower width and minimal bezels will make holding the phone convenient.  The LG G7 will come with the  Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset , which seems to be a common feature in the smartphones of 2018. It will have  64 GB  of internal storage along with  4 GB  of RAM which might be a bit disappointing to some as most flagship smartphones have 6 GB of RAM, but Android’s RAM management these days is much better!  In the camera department, the LG G7 will have dual rear cameras 16-megapixels each. However, there are still no leaks regarding the front-facing camera of the G7.  The LG G7 will be  IP68 certified  which means it will be  water, dust, and impact  resistant.  Wireless charging  is another feature that makes the G7 worth the wait. It was also mentioned that the LG G7 will have ‘boombox’ stereo speakers.  We will be able to know how much of it is true only once the phone is out in the market. If the rumors are true, the phone seems pretty promising with the  MLCD+  display and the Snapdragon 845 SoC. Let’s wait and see if the LG G7 is what we are expecting it to be.

This device may turn a lot of heads with the rumored 7000 mAh battery capacity. In addition to that, it is also said to feature a notch at the top of the display. The notch will supposedly carry dual selfie cameras, earpiece and a couple of sensors. With all these, the device is said to be the world’s first 6.2-inch “top-notch” flagship smartphone with FHD+ resolution.  Surprises don’t end yet because the display is also said to come equipped with an in-display fingerprint scanner. Similarly, the display will sport rounded edges over a 6.2-inch FHD+ body with 2246*1080 screen resolution.  Along with the display and the cameras, NFC will also be a part of the offering. Just like the  UMIDIGI Crystal , that has a type-C USB and dual camera setup on the back, this one is anticipated to have the same.         Rumours have it that the phone will ship with Synaptic’s Clear ID in-display fingerprint scanner, which is one of its type that is available currently out on the market. Those scanners only work with OLED panels, so we expect the UMIDIGI Z2 to come equipped with an OLED screen.  Similar to what other phones UMIDIGI has brought to us, the Z2 will supposedly have a flagship-grade Snapdragon 835 SoC. This will be the first Umidigi smartphone to feature Qualcomm processor.  In terms of storage, the Umidigi Z2 is all set to feature 6GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage with microSD card expansion slot.  The rumored 7000 mAh battery is yet another attention seeking attribute of the device. The specifications UMIDIGI is bringing to the table with the Z2 certainly look striking. Testing the performance of the phone in real life is going to be a lot of fun.  Adding to this is an official announcement from UMIDIGI, on its Twitter account saying that “UMIDIGI Z2 is much more amazing than people expected”. This has surely risen expectations of the people!

That’s why there’s an ever-going competition in between the smartphone manufacturers. They are constantly bringing up the ideas through which they can strengthen their hold in the global market. Recently,\xa0CIA, FBI, and NSA have warned authorities and the public against some companies following some security issues.  One of the companies is  Huawei . The Chinese tech giant which has a firm hold in the global market has recently faced a setback. In fact, a series of setbacks. Let’s find out how.  In 2012, the Congress warned federal authorities from using Huawei and  ZTE  phones. In January this year, AT&T stepped out from the partnership deal between these two.        Recently, the intelligence agencies based in the US – CIA, FBI, and NSA have warned even the public from using the Huawei and ZTE phones.  Well, we are not unknown about the rivalries between China and the US. The clash of ideology between these nations aroused from China being a communist/socialist and the US being the capitalist nation. This is a political issue but how does it affect on whether the Americans use a Chinese brand’s phone or not?  According to FBI director Cris Wray, “It provides the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, and it provides the capacity to conduct undetected espionage.”  The American intelligence agencies are wary of the fact that the Chinese government might invade their national security and steal the data through their smartphone companies. That’s why they even warned the public from using products and services from these companies. Maybe security is not just the issue, the competition of market is a problem as well. As these are the products of a nation whose economic growth is rapid.  What do Huawei and ZTE have to say about this issue?  While this much is being said and done against these companies, they come up for their defense. Both of the companies have their own say regarding this issue.  “We operate in 170 countries where there is trust with governments and customers. We pose no greater  cybersecurity  risk than other vendors,” Huawei said.  “As a publicly traded company, we are committed to adhering to all applicable laws and regulations of the United States, work with carriers to pass strict testing protocols, and adhere to the highest business standards,” said ZTE. To which ZTE had once said, the company’s chipsets incorporated in their phones and devices are manufactured in the US itself. That’s quite a point.  Huawei has its stronghold in middle and eastern European nations, which out-numbers Apple in some parts. Huawei had addressed the last minute scraped deal with AT&T at  CES 2018  this year by stating it as a ‘big loss’ to the company.  According to the Verge, “US lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would ban government employees from using Huawei and ZTE phones altogether.”  The strong ties between these Chinese smartphones and networks giants are also being considered as one of the important reasons why they are being looked at with suspicion.  Not even technology is untouched by the rivalry among nations and their clash in ideology is reflecting on the global market as well. Will these companies be able to make their space in the American market by negotiating and convincing the US agencies? Or will they be restricted as per the news?  While technology is considered to be a bridge towards better relationships between the nations, seems like this will further make the rivalry grow stronger.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Suspicious-Brands.png']

Whenever we are to search something, Google is the word we type in the browser’s search bar. That’s how inclined we are to searching through google.  Throughout years, Google has been adding to its features to make the experience better. And it has recently made some changes to the searching experience.  Followed by the complaint filed to European commission by Getty images in 2016, Google has made some changes to the image search this week. 1. It has removed the ‘view image’ option. 2. It has removed the ‘search image’ option.        Google tweeted: “Today we’re launching some changes on  Google Images  to help connect users and useful websites. This will include removing the View Image button. The Visit button remains, so users can see images in the context of the web pages they’re on. The Search by Image button is also being removed. Reverse image search *still works* through the way most people use it, from the search bar of Google Images”.  Apparently, such changes have been made because of the copyright issues. As the images have been used without citing the source time and again.  Now, with the ‘visit’ option, people will be directed to the website from where the image is sourced. The copyright disclaimer has also been re-written in bigger fonts.  This has provided Getty images with some relief. “This agreement between Getty Images and Google sets the stage for a very productive, collaborative relationship between our companies,” said the CEO of Getty images, Dawn Airey.  This has made the users angry. At least, some tweets indicate so. A tweet reads, “Worst change in the history of mankind.” Others have found why they should opt for Bing or similar search engines where they have ‘view image’ button.  While this makes the legality part stronger, the convenience of people has been compromised with. People can still view the pictures in isolation by the help of ‘open image in new tab option’. But this definitely requires extra clicks.  Google’s search liaison, Danny Suvillian tweeted, “they are designed to strike a balance between serving user needs and publisher concerns, both stakeholders we value.” Since the users don’t seem to be happy, ‘serving user needs’ part is still in question while publisher concerns have definitely been addressed.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Google-view-image-button.jpg']

If you were ever irritated with the pop-ups like that and with annoying ads in the website pages, then there is good news for you. Google Chrome is killing such annoying online ads and pop-ups as an attempt to improve the users’ experience while surfing the internet.  Needless to say, the online ads are excruciatingly annoying. While browsing the content on a website, the ads increase the load time of the pages. And sometimes because of the enormous size of the ad banners, it hides the content and acts as a speed breaker at times. To add more, some websites include irritating pop-ups notifying about the flash sales or sales campaign, which sometimes begins with auto-play videos in the startup. These are some of the ways to make income by the publisher. However, such irksome behavior of the publishers has given rise to the use of a number of Ad-blocker plug-ins to get rid of those ads and pop-ups.         With that being said, the main purpose of the  Google  here is to brutally obliterate the intrusive ads. But all the ads on the web are not going to be removed from their respective websites.  To get better insights, Google conducted a survey among the group of 40,000 internet users and took a test of the user experiences over the certain types of ads. And in the survey, the majority of people had found the\xa0 prestitial ads  to be most intrusive of all.   So, starting with February 15 th , Google started blocking all the intrusive ads, which does not follow the Google Ad guidelines. And only the Ads that follow the  Better Ads Standards  will be welcomed on any website. However, despite the inclusion of non-intrusive Ads on the website, one should also take note of the Ad density. Users usually find the sites with higher  high ad density  displeasing, so Google evaluates the website by examining a sample of pages from the site. After the evaluation, Google checks if the website complies with the guidelines and takes necessary actions.   This campaign by Google looks like a devoted gesture for an improved user experience. However, it might bring black clouds over the income of the publishers. This is just a presumption, so how will this campaign fares and how will it bring improvements in the users’ behaviors, there is more yet to see.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Google-ad-blocker-features.jpg']

To keep the prices low, compromises are made here and there. However, the Moto E4 seems quite somewhat promising in terms of specs even at the budget price point. But how will the smartphone fare in the real-life scenario? Let’s find in this Moto E4 review.   Motorola Moto E4 Specifications   5.0 inches(720 x 1280) @294ppi  Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Protection with Oleophobic Coating  Android 7.1.1 Nougat  Fingerprint sensor  MediaTek MT6737 Quadcore  2GB RAM  16GB Internal Storage, Expandable up to 128 GB.  8MP Rear Camera with f/2.2 aperture.  5MP Front Facing Camera with f/2.2 aperture.  Removable Li-Ion 2800 mAh battery with Fast Charging  Moto E4 Price in Nepal: Rs. 16,290   Design and Build  The smartphone is a miniature version of its sibling, the  Moto E4 Plus . The plastic body provided with a metallic finish and the texture on the power button is barely distinguishable. However, the smartphone gives the vibe of metallic build and feels cold quite often in this chilly weather.         Bezel-less displays are quite trendy these days. However, the Moto E4 has not adopted that alluring design. The smartphone has pretty generous bezels on the forehead and the chin. The forehead has been the habitat for the ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, and the earpiece. Likewise, there is a secluded fingerprint sensor on the chip. The sensor is oblong in shape and has fiercely pushed the touch buttons to the screen. There is also a notification LED on the phone but barely serves the purpose.\xa0 The only time I found the LED lit was while charging handset during the switched off condition.  And talking about the buttons, the Moto E4 has accumulated all the buttons on its right edge. With the power button positioned at an absolute middle and the volume rockers placed just above it, they are easily reachable and provide good haptic feedback on the press. On the top, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack and micro USB slot lies meticulously on the button. The speaker, on the other hand, lies on the lower back of the phone.  Display  The smartphone possesses a 5-inch HD display with 2.5D glass on the top. The pixel density of 294PPI may not seem top-notch in the papers but on the use, the display is satisfyingly crisp and users will barely have an issue. Users would rather enjoy its smooth touchscreen crafted with 2.5D glass and a sensational oleophobic coating. Viewing angle is also fairly decent with an impressive color reproduction. To add more, the display is shielded with Gorilla glass 3 to evade the vulnerabilities regarding the scratches. However, the screen is a notorious smudge magnet and needs cleaning quite often although having an oleophobic coating.   Software and UI  On the software side, Moto E4 is gifted with clean Android Nougat on its system. With just the home-baked Moto app on the shelf, the smartphone lacks the additional touch from the manufacturer. And this is the major advantage with the Moto E4 as the additional customizations and presence of bloatware make the device sluggish and devours the RAM and internal storage of the phone.   The Moto app has Moto actions and Moto display options inside. With the one button navigation option in the Moto action, the fingerprint sensor can be used as a trackpad to replace the on-screen buttons with gestures. There is also swipe to shrink the screen, which narrows down the content in a smaller screen and assists in single hand usability. Likewise, the Night display in the Moto display turns on the blue light filter during the night hours and helps to regulate the sleep cycle.  Performance  Moto E4 is powered by MediaTek 6737 processor aided by 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. The presence of 16GB of onboard storage is nothing out of ordinary at this price point. But the presence of a dedicated slot for the storage expansion definitely is, which lets the users boost the storage without sacrificing the SIM2 slot.  Talking about the performance, I find no issues on loading and running of light apps and games. None of the apps ever crashed or stopped with error messages. However, there was a slight delay while loading heavier games and few stutters were evident on the play. Some heavy titles like Dead Trigger 2, Into the Dead 2, and PES were still playable even with the minor hiccups. And the most praiseworthy of all was the device did not heated much even while playing the games for hours.   Geekbench 4 score of different budget smartphones  Infogram  Camera  Talking about the camera, the smartphone gives the vibe of a camera phone with its protruded camera bump on\xa0the back and LED flash on both ends. However, on the use, I had mixed feelings about it. The 8MP camera on the back was not too shabby and took some decent shots. Photos were fine on the phone’s screen but lacked the sharpness when zoomed or viewed in larger screens. There was also decent color accuracy most of the times but in some images, I noticed yellow tints. Low light shots were satisfactory if not better. Except for few noises and grains, there were no issues on low light shots and the details within the image were easily traceable.   The 5MP front camera was not bad either. It pulled out some social media ready selfies without a fuss. And for the ones, who crave for the beautified selfies in the real time, there is an inbuilt beauty mode. Skin tones are made fairer and facial skins are smoothened in the beautified selfies. Such effects make you look better at times but the facial details are obliterated in most of the cases. And talking about the low light selfies, I was quite disappointed with the front LED flash because of its blinding light. Additionally, the skin looked washed out, which was pretty devastating.   The inefficient HDR mode, sluggish autofocus and the lack of pro mode is a bummer on the phone. And in a nutshell, there is nothing to brag about the cameras in the E4.      Moto E4 camera samples   1  of 10                                                  Low light shot         Image with yellow tint         Image with yellow tint         Selfie with beauty mode off         Selfie with beauty mode on                                          Battery  Beneath the removable back of the Moto E4, there is a 2800mAh removable battery. On my normal daily use, the phone usually backed me up for one complete day. Back up was satisfactory to me but charging the device was a pain in the neck. Although it supports fast charging, I’m disappointed that Motorola provides a stock charger of 5V, 1A, which takes around 2 and a half hours to get it fully charged. You have to spend few extra bucks to buy a separate fast charger. I tried to charge the device with a fast charger of 5V, 2A, and the charging was fast with 0 to 100 within one and a half hour. But the fastest charge would be to buy a separate battery and swap it whenever the other is empty.  Conclusion  To keep the prices low, compromises are inescapable in the budget smartphones. And the Moto E4 has not broken that streak. However, considering the price, the smartphone has not opted in for middling performance on any major fields. The stock Android, sturdy design, and the inclusion of snappy fingerprint are duly remarkable. And the overall performance of the device looks balanced. A better processor and a slightly bigger battery would have been icing on the cake but nonetheless, the Moto E4 is still one of the rockstars in the arena of budget smartphones.

The aim was to make it a platform through which people could communicate through pictures. It gained massive popularity (100,000 users) just within a week. The number has consistently grown through years.  The platform which was limited to just being a photo sharing app slowly upgraded with various updates. The first one was hashtags. Both Instagram and hashtags contributed to each other’s popularity. Then the updates like Insta-filters, tilt-shift, and acceptance of high-resolution pictures were made.  Instagram made its way to the Android Play store in April 2012. The popularity reached its peak with a million downloads within a single day. Insta-direct, a few editing functions, boomerang, new icon, Insta-stories, image zoom, live streaming, uploading multiple photos at a time etc. are the updates Instagram has come up with throughout the years.        Just when we feel like that’s all, Instagram has come up with multiple new updates to our surprise. This time, the update that Instagram is intending to come up with might/might not be as exciting to the users.  Following Snapchat’s footsteps, Instagram is now coming up with an  update  which will notify the creator of the story if we take screenshots. It is similar but not the same.  The notification part is definitely similar but the notification will only be visible to the uploader once they go to the ‘story views’ section. Beside the name of the person who took a screenshot of the story will be a camera-shutter logo. While in  Snapchat,  the notifications are instantly pushed to devices.  If seen from a security point of a view, this keeps the uploader aware. But at the same time, it is not as secure as we think of it to be. Or, we could say, this update will not be fully functional. Why? Because notifications can be prevented if the screenshots are taken while putting the phones on flight-mode. This makes the update kind of futile.  Hence, how effective or necessary this update is, will be known once it is available to everybody. For now, waiting is the key.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/instagram-story-notification-update.png']

['Lava R3 with Dual Bokeh cameras and FaceID launched in Nepal'],['Lava'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 12, 2018']",2018-02-12 03:42:10+00:00,"['It has not been so long that the brand Lava used to focus on producing budget smartphones. But now that trend seems to be lost in the oblivion. Since the announcement of  Lava A3 , Lava has been toiling to pack superior features and raising its standard. Residing in the mid-range section, A3 had kept us awe-struck with elegant cameras, snappy fingerprint sensor, and many more features. And now another smartphone is has come to keep this new Lava tradition alive.  Lava \xa0has brought a new smartphone, which is crafted elegantly and packed with some awe-inspiring features. It is none other than the Lava R3.  Lava R3 possesses a charming 5.7-inch IPS LCD display. The display is elegantly surrounded by narrow bezels across the borders. With the 18:9 aspect ratio prevailing in the market, Lava had been quite hesitant to ignore the trend. And finally, Lava R3 is going to be the first Lava smartphone with  bezel-less display  and18:9 aspect ratio. The display comes with 2.5D glass on the top to offer a seamless experience while viewing the display.  The smartphone comes in two color variants: Black and Blue. Although the device is wrapped in a plastic body, the metallic finish on the top of it gives the vibe of a premium smartphone. And the accented colors of blue or black has given it an enticing looks.        One of the features that are praiseworthy on the device is its superior camera. Although it lacks the fancy dual-camera setup, the 13MP rear camera shoots images with real-time Bokeh effects. So even with a single camera on the action, users can get some nifty shots with a vibrant subject and the blurred background. And this capability crawls to the selfie side. The 8MP camera upfront is also smart enough to identify the subjects and background. After segregating the subjects and the background, the selfie shooter intelligently blurs the background imitating a Bokeh shot. The front camera also has a wide field of view of 84-degrees. So while taking selfies even in a large group of people, there will be less chance of having someone out of the frame.   To improve its capabilities while capturing the images in the low light condition, there is an LED flash both on the front and on the back. The smartphone also has Night Shot master feature, which removes the noises in low light shots and portrays clearer and brighter images.  Lava R3 has also added biometric means to unlock the device adding an additional layer of security option. The smartphone comes with the  FaceID feature  to unlock the device. It is also one of the best features in the  iPhone X  and was hailed all around the globe. With the FaceID feature on the play, the device unlocks in less than a\xa0second (0.8 s to be precise). And talking about the fingerprint sensor, Lava R3 is quite snappy in that department with the unlocking time of mere 0.2 seconds.  The Lava R3 smartphone is powered by MediaTek MT6737 chipset backed by 3GB RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. In terms of software, Lava R3 is privileged with Android Nougat 7.1.1 with Lava’s home-baked ColorOS 4.2 on the top. And there is 3000mAh battery, which keeps the device running.  Lava R3 Specifications   Display: \xa05.7 inches IPS LCD HD+ display with 18:9 aspect ratio  OS: \xa0Android v7.1.1 Nougat with StarOS 4.2 on the top  Chipset: \xa0MediaTek MT6737  CPU: \xa0Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex- A53  GPU: \xa0Mali T720  RAM: \xa03GB  Onboard Storage: \xa032GB  Front camera: \xa08MP, with LED Flash; Real-time Bokeh effects & Night shot master  Rear camera: \xa013MP with LED Flash; Real-time Bokeh effects  Fingerprint Sensor : Yes (unlock time 0.2 seconds)  FaceID (Face Recognition) :\xa0Yes (unlock time 0.8 seconds)  Battery: \xa03000 mAh Non-removable battery  Color Options : Black and Blue   Lava R3 Price in Nepal  In terms of pricing, Lava R3 comes carrying a price tag of  Rs. 18,499 . At this price, the device has to compete against the  Micromax Canvas Infinity , which too comes with the near bezel-less display and an 18:9 aspect ratio. Considering the specs sheet, Lava R3 might have an upper hand over the Canvas Infinity but how will it fare in real life, there is more yet to see.   Lava R3 is being promoted all over. The Facebook page of Lava has also been creating quite a buzz. FullView display, FaceID, snappy fingerprint sensor, and dual Bokeh cameras would obviously be pleasing. But we need have our hands on the device and review it to confirm if it genuinely possesses the promised specs. So till then, we are just obliged to wait.

['Niu N1s Electric Scooter Review: A powerful eco friendly vehicle'],"['e-scooter', 'Niu', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 12, 2018']",2018-02-12 03:08:03+00:00,"['“If aliens did visit us, I’d be embarrassed to tell them we still dig up fossil fuels from the ground as a source of energy.” The internet went crazy after Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted this a few years back. And why would it not, fossil fuel is the major source of pollution in the world right now and on top of that, it is drying up at a fast pace. So, to tackle this issue, various manufacturers are launching electric vehicles around the world and here in Nepal too. And looking to pioneer the movement is Niu, a startup from 2015, which is turning a lot of heads right now. The company has already launched three scooters in Nepal with the Niu N1s leading the campaign.  The N1s is the first electric scooter that carries a number plate on its back, and it has already passed the “White Gumba” uphill test as well. Niu is currently offering the scooter at an initial price of Rs. 265,000 and a discounted price of Rs. 198,888. So, why is the scooter this expensive? And can it really change the ongoing trend of vehicles running on petroleum products here in Nepal? Let’s find it out.         Design   The Niu N1s is a compact scooter with a futuristic look. The vehicle certainly has a unique design that can catch anyone’s eye. The front of the N1s has a curved and non-traditional look. There is a headlight on the front right below the company’s emblem. An official at Niu Nepal told me that the headlights have been specially made to signify the logo of Niu. It has dual smart LED bulbs which automatically light up sensing the environment a person is riding the vehicle around. There is a LCD display up front which shows the remaining battery charge, the speed you are riding the scooter in and the power mode you have chosen to ride it in.   Right under the seat is a storage compartment which is quite spacious considering how compact the N1s it. It can easily house your helmet and few other objects. There is also a lock that opens the battery compartment which is right below the footboard. One feature that got me confused at the start was the way you open the storage compartment lock. You will have to unlock it from the scooter’s primary lock itself.  Performance  Yes, this vehicle has three levels of power mode rather than gears. And basically, the higher the level you choose, the faster the scooter goes. It can easily speed up to 50-52 km/h in the city roads. However, this scooter suffers a little from the unfinished roads as the ride is bumpy due to its lightness and suspension. And continuing with the cons, the scooter lacks ample ground clearance, so its base constantly hits the bumps. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it can’t handle Kathmandu’s roads. The N1s easily breezes through the roadway of the city and I also had no problem riding it on the muddy roads. It has double disc brakes, so you can trust the braking system at the time of need.  The Uphill Test   One of the frequently asked questions about the scooter is whether it passes the uphill test or not. Well, even when galloping through a busy steep uphill roadway, this scooter easily climbs up, and that too with a pillion behind me. The FOC in the scooter, which acts as the brain, monitors the electricity demand to power the BOSCH motor effectively whenever necessary.  Battery   The BOSCH Motor is powered by a portable 60V 29 Ah Lithium-Ion battery which alone costs a whopping Rs. 80,000. This battery is placed right below the footboard and is easy to carry around as it weighs 10kgs. \xa0It took me around 6 hours and Rs. 52 to fully charge it up. You can charge the scooter directly from the port placed at the under-seat storage or take out the battery and charge it wherever you want to. Niu has claimed that the N1s can provide a mileage of 80km. On my test, \xa0I got around 36 km of mileage when the battery consumption was down to 50%. However, a few days back, when I tried to go from 100 – 0%, the N1s ran only for around 60 km. So, even though you can travel a lot on a minimum price of Rs. 52, you cannot expect the N1s to be consistent with its mileage.  Experience  Now talking about the riding experience, the N1s is as smooth as silk and the seats are really comfortable. If you can ignore the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu City and focus on the ride, you will really enjoy it. Well, I did!   And the first thing you notice while riding the scooter is the lack of sound. The engine doesn’t make any sound at all, so it will take a few minutes to get used to the noise-less experience. Niu has not only focused on tackling air pollution but has also worked to minimize the noise pollution.  App Integration          One of the best features of the Niu N1s is its app integration. There is a unique SIM number in the scooter which when entered into the Niu App, shows each and everything regarding the vehicle. I had a hard time registering my scooter though as the app still seems to be in a developmental phase. But once I got the registration, I was amazed at how useful the application is. It shows real-time battery life and the location of your Niu scooter. So, with the N1s, you will have that extra security if you ever happen to lose your vehicle. It also has a different tab to check the statistics of your travel in a single day.  Warranty and Customer Service  According to Eco Infinity, the NIU Bosch Motor and LG/Panasonic lithium ion carry two years warranty. The company offers free “Roadside Assistance” if you ever happen to need some help with your scooter. Also, the service centers and charging stations are attached to Niu’s showrooms as well.\xa0Eco Infinity has also installed free charging stations at Evo Store (Labim Mall, Sherpa Mall and Mercantile Plaza).  Currently, the following warranty offers are available on the Niu N1s ( courtesy: Eco Infinity ):      Electronics  Charger  Performance failure and irreparable caused by defective product.  24 months    \xa0  FOC Controller, Smart Controller, Dashboard, Throttle Handle, main Harness, Horn, Remote Immobilizer, Flasher, Ignition Lock (inc secondary lock and keys)   12 months    \xa0  DC-DC Adaptor   9 months    \xa0  Combination switches, USB charger assembly, Cable hall sensor, Turning signal lights, Front light, Rear light   6 months    Motor  Motor  Missing Phase, Burned, Demagnetization  24 months or 20000km    Battery  Lithium Battery Pack  Only use the battery pack under\xa0 operational environment after charged (charging temperature range 0 degree Celsius to 35 degree Celsius. Operational environment).  24 months or 20000km      Conclusion   At last, you’re probably wondering whether the Niu N1s is worth the huge price tag. Yes, maybe Niu Nepal will do better if considers decreasing the initial price of Rs. 265,000. But still, it is a comfortable and a powerful machine that can handle everything you throw at it. And on top of that, with everything going electric, and pollution already crossing WHO’s limit, it’s about time we switch to a vehicle that can actually help control the environmental issues. The Niu N1s is an elegant, powerful and unique device that is made up of state of the art products. So, if you want a scooter that offers quite a bit of mileage, and also want to go green, you should definitely get a new Niu N1s.

Since 2007, when Android was first launched, it’s been the most entertained  Operating System(OS)  throughout the history of smartphones.  The journey that started from (Android 1.5)  Cupcake  has now reached (Android 8.0-8.1)  Oreo  which is the 13 th  version of Android .  Android OS has only grown year through year. Ten years and 13 versions later, adding to that, Google will be soon launching its 14 th  version i.e. Android P.  As we know, it has been several months since Android  Oreo  was launched. But, as per the sources, the recent  Android  version that is being used mostly is the  Android Nougat ,  which is one and a half years old version.        The usage of the Nougat version of this OS has increased by  2.2 percentage  making it 28.1 percent from the earlier usage of 26.3 percent.\xa0 The increase in the use of Nougat has definitely decreased the use of Android Marshmallow. But, the usage of Marshmallow has declined only about 0.5 percent.  The usage of Android Oreo 8.1.0 and 8.1.1 combined is 1.1 percent which is quite a slow development as it has already been 6 months since Oreo was launched.   Android versions usage  Infogram  The common reason of slowing down of updates is being considered is Android fragmentation.  The number of Android version distribution was tracked through Android devices that accessed to Google play for a period of seven days till 5 th  of February,2018. Accuracy is still in question but we can definitely see Android fragmentation game going strong.  There is no official definition as to what the term ‘’Android fragmentation” means. But, there are different interpretations from different tech companies and tech scholars. According to Techopedia, “Android fragmentation\xa0refers to a concern over the alarming number of different available\xa0Android versions in the market.”  As Google is continuously coming up with newer Android versions, the customized Android skin of the Android-run phones sometimes is so distinct from the stock version that the updated versions can’t function well even if they are updated. Even then smartphone companies don’t make updates available at all and if not, they make the updates available rarely.  Sometimes new updates come with bugs in them which either slows down the phone or drains down the battery. That might also be one of the reasons customers not as much interested in updating their phones from the Android version that was preinstalled in the device.  While Apple has already made its iOS 11 version available in all of its devices with the frequent updates to the same version consistently, Android has lagged behind.  People would definitely not buy a new phone every year the Android OS is developed and companies are also not working towards mitigating this lag in OS update the result of which is very much visible with the usage of Nougat version.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Android-Nougat-usage-percentage.jpg']

On the optics side, all the rumors suggest a  dual camera setup  including the 12MP and 13MP sensors with Carl Zeiss lens on the back. But people do not seem sure with the kind of setup employed. Looking at the Nokia 8, we can guess a setup including  Monochrome and RGB sensor . And on the other side, with the big names like Samsung and Apple going with the  Telephoto + Wide-angle setup  and many other brands imitating the move, we can expect a similar move from the Nokia.  Upfront, there will be a 16MP camera to take selfies and for video calling. Looking at past scenarios, we can predict that the Nokia 7 Plus camera app will contain the infamous Bothie feature. On the OS side, the device will come with the Stock  Android Oreo  out of the box. And turning back the previous records, the device will surely receive the updates in the future.  The device will come with the generous 3800mAh non-removable battery with the compatibility for the fast charging. And talking about the sensors, the Nokia 7 Plus will possess all the primary sensors with the fingerprint sensor on the back. A snappy fingerprint sensor is nothing new in the smartphones these days. But since the Nokia 7 Plus seems to possess all the trending features, the presence of the Face Unlock feature for an extra layer of security will not be a surprise.  The device will come with a metallic body with dust and water resistant build to add the elegance of the premium devices. The Nokia 7 Plus will also come with the port for the 3.5mm headphone jack.  Nokia 7 Plus specifications (Rumored)   Display : 6-inch FullView IPS LCD display with Gorilla Glass protection  Resolution : Full HD+ (2160 x 1080 pixels), 18:9 aspect ratio @ 402PPI pixel density  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 660  CPU : Octa-core (4x Kryo 260 @ 2.2GHz + 4x Kryo 260 @ 1.8GHz)  GPU : Adreno 512  Rear Camera : Dual camera; 13MP + 12MP Carl Zeiss lens  Front Camera : 16MP  OS : Stock Android Oreo out of the box  RAM : 4GB or 6GB  Internal storage : 64GB; Expandable via SD card  Connectivity : Dual SIM, 4G, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, A-GPS, USB Type-C, USB OTG  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, ambient light, proximity, compass  Battery : 3800mAh non-removable battery with Fast charging (18W, 9V/2A)   Nokia 7 Plus Expected Price and Launch Date  The  Nokia 7  had the price tag of $380 and $410 for the 4GB and 6GB RAM variant respectively. With the specs bump, we can expect a price surge in this device. On considering the specifications, the smartphone may demand a price of $400 and $450 respectively for the 4GB and 6GB variants.  And talking about the launch date, one clear guess will be the MWC 2018, which kicks off from the February 26. The frequent teasers from Nokia for the MWC 2018 have also cued to the prediction. But if even the device does not make in the MWC 2018, the device could be launched someday before the end of Q1.  Once the device gets launched in the global market, Nokia 7 Plus will soon make a presence in Nepal. The global launch date of the device is still under the veil, so its availability cannot be predicted yet. But we can expect the device to launch in at most a month later than the global availability of the device. When the device makes its way to Nepal, its price will be close to the international pricing.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nokia-7-Plus-price-specs-rumors.jpg']

They sold exactly 13.9 million smartphones in 2017, which does seem like a big number but they have yet to turn in a profit. According to their financial reports, the last time there mobile division actually made a profit was in 1Q17 in a span of 11 quarters.  They didn’t even launch any smartphone in China last year. And this year, we get an official confirmation why. The main reason behind it was the market saturation and competition from the local players from China. The last smartphone that LG launched was the G5 SE, and that was back in May of 2016.  LG mobile phone business has quit China   Bringing numbers into context, the Korean manufacturer sold a total of 160,000 units in China in 2016 out of a total 480 million total shipped in the region.

We can see its noticeable presence in the Nepali market as well. And the company has been successful in making their own space here. We did see Huawei smartphones emerging as a new favorite of buyers’ in the past.  If the rumors and the tweet made by one of the reliable leaker Evan Blass are considered, the new P-series phone from Huawei, which will be named P20, might have three rear cameras in them.  However, again the name for the P series phones are not yet definite. Mostly, there’s a confusion over if the series will be called P11(as the P-series have phones up to P10). But, other rumors regarding the name going around in various tech news portals also are taking P20 into consideration.        We are well acquainted with the phrase ‘two is always better than one’. But is ‘three is better than two’? Well, that’s yet to be tested and verified. We will not have to wait for very long if sources are to be trusted.  Three different models are expected to launch in the P-series with all three devices featuring triple rear cameras. There is again a confusion going on around as to whether the placement of the cameras would be horizontal or vertical. However, no matter the placement, the thing that concerns us more is the camera quality.  The rumors have already set the expectations high up. The cameras will measure 40 MP, 5 times zoom and ‘pro’ night mode. They are believed to have both digital and optical zoom. Even the front camera might have a 24 MP lens.  What would be the impact of having three rear cameras while most of the recently launched smartphones have 2 rear cameras already?  As having two rear cameras have made the photography experience better with the depth effect, this might further advance depth in pictures.  While two different lenses could be used to take better telephoto or wide-angle pictures while the similar lenses could be used to enhance the picture quality.  The phones with dual rear cameras also are effective for better framing of the pictures and taking videos with extensive noise cancellation. Having triple cameras might make the experience further plausible with triple sensors.  Well, Google Pixel 2 has a single camera and still, the performance is hugely being appreciated.  According to Forbes, triple cameras can be taken as a threat to Samsung 8 and iPhone X.  These phones will supposedly release during MWC (Mobile World Congress), tracking the former release record of Huawei phones.

Even though top 5 vendor companies have increased shares in the global market, others are struggling to maintain their shares. Is the reason smartphones being priced as a luxury than the need?  Since the past decade and a half, cellphones have grown as the much-needed commodity of life. Had we have to live without cellphones once we had gotten a hang of it, it would feel as if we have time traveled to the past. The growing rush and the need for modern-day population, mobile phones have created their own space in our day-to-day life.  The concept of having just mobile phones is also outdated and smartphones are ruling for almost a decade now. Every new feature, may it be in terms of looks or the performance, creates an urge in us to get hold of the phone. Thanks to our addiction of smartphones and ever growing smart features in them.        For a layperson, we would understand the situation as cellphones are in high demand and the smartphone manufactures might be having a difficult time to cope up with the demand. But now, the case is not so.  According to IDC (Interactive Data Corporation), there has been a drop in the demand for smartphones. The decline in smartphones shipment reached 14 percent by the end of 2017.  According to The Guardian, this fall is caused by the collapse of the Chinese market and Apple shipping 5 million fewer devices.  Getting into the how abouts of the situation, the drop in shipment is presumed to be majorly due to the production of more high-end phones. People are definitely buying the high-end phones but this situation has also led to people not changing their smartphones frequently.  iPhone, which is well known for being expensive from the very beginning, is still raising its price range which reached on top with its X model.  Samsung has also been following Apple’s footsteps in increasing the price of their smartphones. S series is already known for being expensive. Currently, the A-series models A8 and A8+ which are supposed to be midrange phones were launched with a hefty price tag which the flagship phones have.  On the other hand, the innovation in smartphones has slowed down in past few years. The smartphone companies have come up with a very few changes in past years. The new, exclusive feel is therefore missing. When one’s existing smartphone is not lagging more than the newly launched smartphones, why would anyone bother to spend a high amount of money just for the sake of getting a new one?  The past year, bezel-less displays and dual rear cameras were the only features that kept the smartphone business going.  The top five smartphone companies: Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo respectively have had an increment in their sales globally whereas, the other smartphone companies had to face the loss in shares in the global market followed by decreased sales.  The increasing reach of artificial intelligence, the awareness of people in regards to smartphones and the features, is increasing as well. So, if the smartphone companies tend to fill up the gap that 2017 saw, some distinct features other than the camera quality and increasing the screen space users need to be served with something that brings back the excitement of buying smartphones revive.  Highlights   A global drop in smartphone shipment.  Collapsing of Chinese market  Apple decreased the shipping of iPhone by 5 million  Ever raising price, decreasing affordability  Companies like Samsung following Apple’s footsteps on pricing smartphones  Smartphone companies not coming up with innovative ideas anymore  Not much change in device’s outlook']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/samsung-mobile-price-nepal-2017.jpg']

It works by adding of airtime which NT allows the customers having a low balance and no balance at all, the addition of which will make the customers be able to continue with the phone call even if the balance is over.  But, the added airtime is not free of cost. The cost of the phone call will be deducted once the customer recharges the phone and the amount remaining after the deduction from earlier airtime credit will be the actual balance of the phone. So, is it different from NCELL’s loan service?  As per the claims made by the CEO, yes, it is. It is different in a way that there will be no extra cost added to the regular phone call cost while there is added service charge as in NCELL’s loan service. So, it saves even if the amount is negligible.  As a demonstration to the invitees, the Minister of Communication and Information made a call to one of the state ministers from a phone which had very less balance in order to show how this credit system works.  “Namaste credit” will come into effect within a month from the date of the anniversary.  There are several other data offers as well as call time offers which NTC announced on the occasion of its 14th anniversary. The details are in  NTC’s official website  itself.

['Colors S11 Review: The Widening Horizon of Budget Smartphones'],"['Android', 'Colors', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 6, 2018']",2018-02-05 19:05:13+00:00,"['2017 was a great year for dual cameras. However, only a few mid-range and budget-oriented smartphones actually featured dual lenses. 2018 is turning out to be a little bit different as even the low-end smartphones are following the dual cameras bandwagon. And doing so right now is Colors with its new smartphone the S11 which has become Nepal’s first smartphone to be available exclusively online. The device sure has turned over a lot of heads with its specifications, and more importantly, the dual front cameras. But how does the device perform in real life? Is it as good as it looks on paper? Let’s find out. But before starting, let’s get the specs out of the way.   Colors S11 Specifications:   5.2-inch IPS LCD display, HD (720 x 1280 pixels) resolution  MediaTek MT6737W chipset  8MP Dual-selfie camera; 120-degree field of view  8MP rear camera with LED flash  Rear mounted fingerprint sensor  3GB RAM  16GB internal storage; dedicated slot for SDcard  Dual-SIM (4G + 3G)  Android Nougat (v7.0) out of the box  3000mAh battery  Price: Rs. 16,495  Introductory Price: Rs. 12,495 (with 24% discount)  Additional Benefits on the purchase: 1200MB Ncell data and Rs. 250 gift voucher free on next purchase on Daraz   Camera  Even under a price tag of Rs. 12,495, Colors has managed to include a dual front camera setup on its new smartphone. The extra lens on the smartphone is used to capture wide-angle images. And this lens is capable of capturing 120-degree field of view. This surely helps whilst taking group selfies. And the quality of the images under well-lit conditions are great as well.                         The images that I took had proper contrast, colors, and saturation. If you are into vlogging and are on a tight budget, the Colors S11 will certainly help you with its wide-angle lens. However, the primary front-facing lens, which also measures 8-megapixel takes better pictures than the wide-angle on in darker environment as you can see from these two images. Overall, the dual camera setup on the S11 works wonders and can take selfies that are even better than some of the devices that cost of 20k.  On the rear side sits an 8-megapixel lens which is only average. Take this image as an example.   The red colored building is looking somewhat orangey and if you take a closer look at the bottom left corner, the house looks quite blurred out. And the sky, which was bit blue when I took this image, has come out a tad bit white.             And night time pictures come out quite grainy as you can see in the image here. But then again, it all comes down to the pricing. Colors has done quite well with the selfie camera but has cut cost with the rear camera as it is only satisfactory.  Display   The Colors S11 is a device meant for users who are after compact smartphones. It has a 5.2-inch HD IPS LCD display. Now, the display isn’t the most saturated one out there but the color reproduction is good. I also like the ample brightness this display produces. It is visible under direct sunlight as I had no problem breezing through the software even under the sun. Watching videos on the device is certainly entertaining, but at times, you might feel that it fails to pack the final punch due to the lesser vibrancy. And since it has an IPS LCD panel, the display doesn’t produce deeper blacks. However, I did miss the in-built Night Mode display setting on this device!  Design   Smartphone manufacturers play a trick on their customers these days. They cover their smartphone with plastic that has a metal-like finish and boasts about having a metallic finish. The same is the case of the Colors S11. The company has cleverly worked in order to make the device feel like metal. Colors includes aluminum in a lot of smartphone these days. The company has opted for plastic probably to cut cost.  The plastic body has made the smartphone light and easy to handle. The back of the S11 is a tad bit slippery though! The rear side houses a fingerprint scanner and a primary camera. One can even say this device shares a similar design with iPhones. On one side, the device has a power button and volume rockers.  Performance and Software  The S11 comes with the entry level MediaTek MT6737 chipset along with 3 GB of RAM. It is commendable that budget smartphone these days are focusing more on performance too. The device can handle navigating through different apps and light internet browsing. However, it takes a bit of time to open up apps every now and then. Plus there were occasional lags when I tried to do too many things at once. But this is expected with a device with such a low-budget price tag. Games that don’t require a lot of the GPU run with ease. Playing high-end games, however, results in frame drops, but still, I was impressed with how the S11 could run a few graphics intensive games with only occasional lags. And even with long sessions of gaming, the device doesn’t heat up. It does get warm but there’s nothing to worry about.  However, the S11’s competitors certainly outperform the device in terms of performance. It did give me a respectable score on Antutu but devices such as the Xiaomi Redmi 4A and Moto E4 easily score higher than the S11.                   The near-stock Android has certainly helped boost up the performance. The S11 runs on Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box with no skin on top. There are a few Nepali applications that come pre-installed but hey at least you have an option to uninstall them! There is no additional bloatware on the device and navigating through the software, there were no stutters. Colors has included its own app in the device which shows the list of service centers available in Nepal. Now I have never seen any other smartphone include such an app but sincerely hope others will follow. This app will certainly save customers from the hassle of spending time just to find out a service center near them.  Hardware   The Colors S11 has 16 GB of internal memory which is complemented by expandable memory. It has a fingerprint scanner, too, a feature we don’t usually see in a smartphone of its price range. The rear-mounted fringerprint scanner is satisfactory, it does what its suppose to do but takes a little bit of time to unlock the smartphone.  At the bottom sit dual speaker grills. However, only one of them actually serves as a loudspeaker.  Battery   In the battery department, the Colors S11 has a 3,000 mAh battery. I had initial thoughts that the battery, coupled with an HD display, would easily provide me a screen on time of around 5 hours. However, that was not the case in my usage as the device gave me around 4 – 4 and a half hours of screen on time. Now I am not complaining that the battery life is bad or anything, but with the HD display, I had more expectation.  Colors has claimed that the S11 comes with MediaTek’s own fast charging technology – Pump Express 2.0. While the fast charging support certainly sounds intriguing, it took me around 3 hours to fully charge the device from 0 – 100%. But it yet again comes back to the pricing. We can’t really expect a device worth 12000 to come supported by a fast charging technology, can we?  Conclusion  The Colors S11 has started a revolution in the smartphone industry in Nepal. The device is the first smartphone to be available exclusively online, which has definitely helped reduce the cost. Yes, it does compromise on the performance and camera front, but paying Rs. 12,495 gets you dual front cameras with the impressive wide-angle camera, 3000 mAh battery and a near stock android experience. What Colors has done with the S11 is praise-worthy, and you won’t regret your decision of buying this smartphone.      Pros  Cons    Dual front-facing cameras  Average performance    120-degree selfies  Battery charging time    Fingerprint scanner on a budget     Near-stock Android']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Colors-s11-feature.jpg']
['Bose Soundlink Micro Review: The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker for its Size?'],"['Bluetooth Speaker', 'Reviews']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 5, 2018']",2018-02-05 17:52:35+00:00,"['Gone are the days when the bulky and high power-devouring speakers used to be installed for amplifying sound. These days, speakers are available in small form factor, which intensifies the sound level to a great extent without major compromises on the sound quality. And adding to the list, there is Bose Soundlink Micro Speaker, which comes at a portable size and promises for a superior audio quality. But how does this device fares in real life? Let’s find in this Bose Soundlink Micro review.   Bose Soundlink Micro Specifications   Connectivity Technology : wireless (Bluetooth)  Controls : activate Bluetooth, power on/off, volume  Battery : Rechargeable  Recharge Time : 4 hours  Battery Backup (Up To) : 6 hours  Color : Midnight blue, Orange, Black  Body Material : Silicone rubber  Protection : Waterproof (IPX7 certified)  Speaker Channel Type : Mono  Amplification Type : Active  Transmission Range : 9 meters  Intelligent Assistant Compatible : Google Assistant, Siri  Hands-Free Function : Yes  Amplification Type : Active  Audio Amplifier : Integrated  Dimensions : 9.9 x 9.9 x 3.5 cm  Weight : 290 grams  Price : Rs. 18,000 ( Evostore )   Also Read:\xa0 Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers under Rs. 10000 in Nepal        Build and Design  To be honest, the speaker got me impressed in the first glance. With the rounded edge across the corners, the soundlink micro looked aesthetically and ergonomically flawless. The speaker fits perfectly within my palm, all thanks to its minimalist construction. It is light with just 290 grams of weight and doesn’t feel hefty even when carried around in a pocket. But you don’t need to do that as it has a rubberized silicone strap embedded to its back. The strap is tear-resistant and can be employed to fix the speaker in the belts or belt loops, backpack, handle of the bike or any place convenient.   The attachment is firm and you don’t need to worry about the fall. Even if it falls, the silicone rubber wrapped around the device keeps it perfectly safe from the scratches, cracks, and dents conveniently protecting the speaker inside. Even on my use, the device fell quite often, but all thanks to the design, it still looks almost new and the quality of sound is still the same. In addition, the soundlink Micro is IPX7 certified so it is resistant to water and moistures. The speaker remains unscathed even if it is submerged in a water pool up to 30 feet for around thirty minutes. This specialty has made it suitable for the use during the showers, while swimming and even in the rain dance.   There are five buttons in the device to handle the job eloquently. With volume rockers and multi-function buttons, there are three buttons altogether embedded on its chest. The power button and active Bluetooth button lies on the top with micro USB 2.0 port accommodated between them. In the proximity to the charging port, there are six LEDs to depict the power state of the speaker. The secluded single LED on the right-hand side depicts the power on/off state of the speaker, whereas the remaining five on its left denotes the battery level while charging.  Also Read:\xa0 Anker SoundCore nano Review: Best Bluetooth Speaker Below Rs.2,000  Pairing and Control  Since the soundlink micro is the wireless speaker, it pairs with the audio device via Bluetooth. The pairing and connection is pretty fast with the device and a voice prompt states the name of the device connected.   Once the connection is established, every sound from the audio device is amplified from the speaker. The amount of loudness of the audio can be controlled through the volume buttons on its chest. The multi-function button in between the volume buttons comes handy on playing/pausing the audio, toggling to the next and previous, and on triggering the AI assistant in the smartphones. While playing the music, pressing the multi-function button twice skips the tracks and plays next song in the list, whereas pressing it thrice plays back the previous song. And a single press suffices the toggle between the play and pause.  Once connected to the smartphone, pressing and holding the multi-function button triggers the AI assistant of the smartphone. There is also a mic right on the top of the Bose logo through which command to the AI assistants can be given. This mic also comes handy during the phone conversation in hands-free mode.   For the hassle-free control of the speaker via smartphone, Bose has also developed the app named Bose Connect. With this app, the state of power and volume can be known. Playing/pausing the music and volume can also be controlled through this app. The best thing about the app is it helps to pair the device with another Bose speaker for more loud and vibrant stereo output.  Sound Performance  In terms of Sound output, the speaker is unarguably the best speaker at its size. I was impressed by its level of amplification and the sound quality. Bose has injected “custom-engineered transducer and miniature dual-passive radiators” in the speaker to enhance the audio supremely. While listening to the classic blues and rock music, walking bass lines has a pleasing rumble. And along with the soothing sensation, they are vivid and clear at lower volumes. However, as the volume is increased near to the maximum level, noises dive in to mix in the audio and the music sounds little distorted. So playing music at 50-75% always result in the better audio quality.  Punk tracks from the device ring in the device with great acute sound with suitably loud intensity. But more complex, textured mids in jazz and classic songs, while audible, generally are not as pronounced as they are on more expensive, slightly larger speakers, and this has been an issue on all the small-sized speakers.   In a nutshell, the Micro has an impressive performance on the overall sound quality with remarkable gain. However, the speaker does not offer 360-degree sound because of which a shift from the speaker’s path results in the muddier and less intense sound. This is definitely a major issue if the speaker is used at parties and group hangouts.  Battery  For the size and portability, Bose seems to make a compromise on the battery. The battery backed me up for six hours while playing music with the volume at 50%. Like every other wireless speaker out on the market, its battery life also diminished when the amplification was increased. The speaker ran powerless after four hours when the songs were played at its maximum intensity. Charging is also little sluggish in the device. The device took around four hours to get it fully charged with its stock charger of 5V, 1A.  Verdict  Bose Soundlink micro is a great audio gadget for the audiophiles who opt for minimum size and maximum portability. Its size assists for the use in multiple occasions like biking, hiking, jogging and small indoor get together. But the short battery life ruins the fun in major scenarios as the charge diminishes quickly. Also at the price of Rs. 18,000, the device is awfully expensive. So, if sound quality is the major priority along with the portability then Soundlink Micro is the perfect audio gadget at this size. However, if prolonged battery life is all you need then  JBL Clip 2  would be the perfect fit. The JBL Clip 2 comes in nearly same form factor at a cheaper price offering 8 hours of backup but with few compromises on the audio quality.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bose-soundlink-micro-review-1.jpg']
"['According to NTA, the internet penetration in Nepal has reached 63%']",[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['February 5, 2018']",2018-02-05 14:55:16+00:00,"['Nepali youths and their love for internet are not unknown to us. We can see people busy on their phones with cellular data on when getting into a public vehicle, or walking through the streets, might be in some malls or even in the movie theatres.  Not just youths these days but also children and elderly people are seen using the internet. Especially in the valley and areas around it where most of the population lives. The use of internet might not be consistent per se but the availability, as well as the demand for the same, is well known.  A recent Management Information system(MIS) report from Nepal Telecom Authority(NTA) states that the internet penetration rate as of Kartik 2074 is nearly 63% in Nepal which is a large number considering Nepal being an underdeveloped country and secondly the literacy rate of Nepal according to CBS report, 2011 is 66%.        Does it mean that internet is heading towards being one of the basic needs in Nepal? Or is it already? We are yet to find it out as the illiterate population might not be that into internet whereas the literacy percentage is just 3% more than the internet penetration rate as per the mentioned MIS report.  Looking at the other side of the statistics, it’s been almost 6 years since the CBS report was published so the literacy rate might have increased in these 5 years.  The education system in urban areas is more or less internet based these days. This also may have contributed a lot in the increment of the number of internet users.  Availability of smartphones at an affordable rate these days and the availability of network in the rural areas can also be considered as one of the major reasons for the high percentage of internet penetration in Nepal.  It certainly has made people acquainted with global news and trends but can it be considered as the increment in the living standard of people in terms of earning? Certainly not.  The internet certainly is growing as a need among the people globally. If the stats provided by NTA is true, this sure is a positive change in terms of generating awareness and for the people to stay informed.

This year too,  Oppo  has brought to the table the Oppo A71 2018 with a couple of improvements to its predecessor. The specifications are pretty the same in this model too, like the 5.2-inch display with 720p display resolution, 5MP selfie camera, 13 MP rear camera, 3000 mAh battery and 16 GB of internal expandable storage.  Also Read:  Oppo Mobiles Price in Nepal  The Oppo A71 2018 has been launched globally and is soon to launch in Nepal too.

The new variant surprisingly comes with a GB less RAM, i.e. 2 GB instead of the previously offered 3 GB of RAM.        As mentioned earlier, another major change in the 2018 variant of the Oppo A71 is the chipset. The 2017 version of this device offered MediaTek’s MT 6750 chipset while the new 2018 version offers a Snapdragon 450 chipset.

Last year,  HMD Global  revamped the mobile and brought it to the mobile world as  Nokia 3310 2017 . The same sturdy design and the inbuilt snake game brought nostalgia to its users. However, the mobile failed to please its users since it lacked the features that are considered indispensable these days. Reconsidering the concept, the HMD Global has now brought the Nokia 3310 4G.

Also Read:  Nokia Mobiles Price in Nepal  With the 4G connectivity (VoLTE & LTE) prevailing all around the globe, different countries had discontinued the older 2G connectivity. Last year, when HMD Global brought the modern Nokia 3310, everyone got perplexed because the cellular connectivity in the device was limited to 2G.

['Huawei Y7 Review: The Best Budget Phone?'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 30, 2018']",2018-01-30 14:37:07+00:00,"['If you’re looking for a budget smartphone under the range of Rs 15,000, Huawei has brought a new smartphone from the ‘Y’ series notable as  Huawei Y7 . Huawei is well known for its refined specs even at a mid-range or lower budget which is why Huawei trends in Nepal. This smartphone is more or less made for the people who especially look for a long-lasting battery life. Huawei Y7 offers a massive a battery of 4000 mAh. But except the massive battery what other highlights do Huawei Y7 have? Let’s find out in this review.   Specifications:   Display:\xa0 5.5-inch HD IPS LCD Display with 267 PPI Pixel density  Dimensions:  153.6 x 76.4 x 8.4 mm   Weight:  165 gram  OS:\xa0 Android 7.1 Nougat with EMUI 5.1 on the top  Chipset:\xa0 Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 (1.4GHz Octa-core)\xa0CPU  RAM:\xa0 2GB   Internal Storage:  16GB (Expandable up to 256GB)  Rear Camera:\xa0 12 MP (f/2.2, 1/2.9″, 1.25 µm), phase detection autofocus, LED,\xa0 flash\xa0touch focus, face detection  Front Camera:\xa0 8MP, f/2.0  Connectivity:  Dual-SIM (micro+nano), 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, FM Radio  Sensors: \xa0 accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass and ambient light sensors  Battery: \xa0Non-removable\xa0Li-Ion 4000 mAh battery   Design & Build  Huawei Y7 has a very stylish design with a plastic back enclosed in a metallic frame. However, it has been smoothly designed and colored giving it a metallic look and feel. The phone is a pleasure to hold but it frequently slipped from my hands due to the metallic edges. The 16:9 ratio display makes the phone hard to handle with one hand. However, the shape of the phone does make it somewhat easier to handle.         Display  It has an 8.4mm thickness and weighs about 165 gms. It comes with a 5.5-inch HD display which is bigger than phones of same pricing range like  Samsung J2 Pro  and  Redmi 4A . It has an IPS LCD display giving it a captative and clear display. And since the resolution is just HD, I found watching movies wasn’t really delightful.   Hardware  The standby volume key is easily felt on the right-hand side. The regular micro USB port is located at the bottom along with the speaker. There is only one speaker on the left side while the other is noise cancellation. Although the speaker isn’t very loud, I would say it is pretty decent in this pricing range. While the 3.5mm headphone jack and a noise-canceling sensor are located at the top. On the left side, you get a dual nanohybrid sim card slot which means you can insert 2 SIM cards or a SIM card and a micro SD. Also, there is a small LED on top, which blinks to alert if there is any notification.   Talking about the sensors, it has an accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass and\xa0ambient light sensor. Since it bears\xa0ambient light sensor, it\xa0saves the trouble of altering the brightness under different lighting conditions. However, it lacks fingerprint sensor.  Performance  Huawei Y7 runs on Snapdragon 435 octa-core chipset along with 2GB RAM and 16GB internal storage. The performance, however, hasn’t been an exception. It performed well with light apps and games. As expected in this price range, while playing high-end games like ‘Into the death’, froze and started heating up within 10 mins or less. Even while using apps like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat and light games simultaneously, it tends to heat up within 45 mins.  Software  Moving on to the software department, it runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat with EMUI version 5.1. The UI has evolved over the years. There is no app drawer by default but you can add app drawer later. It has even added notification panel and other improvements giving a more stock Android experience.                The phone also has many fascinating features in the settings. It has integrated new ‘eye comfort’ mode which helps to filter out blue light to protect from visual fatigue. It also has glove mode which enables you to operate the smartphone with thin gloves. Besides that, it also comes with one-handed UI enabling easy operation with one hand. The phone comes with a built-in step counter so you can keep track of your health.  Battery  Like I mentioned before, the battery is very astonishing. I tried my best to drain the battery life but it seems that the battery is pretty efficient and long-lasting. The 4000 mAh battery is plenty for an average user. The phone can go on for about 2 days if you are a light user. But it can last for a whole day even if you are an intense user. The screen-on time was about 7 hours. It lacks Quick Charging but boasts a Huawei-developed power-saving solution intended to bridge that gap.   Camera  Y7 features 12 MP rear camera with LED-flash on the back followed by an 8-megapixel front camera which is decent for a phone at this price. The pictures are clear and it records decent videos too. What I admire is that the focus of the rear camera is very quick and accurate. It also offers many features like pro photo and video mode, beautify, time lapse, slow-mo, HDR, etc which is nice to see in phones falling under this range.   Phase Detection Auto Focus allows you to focus on your subject in just 0.3s, making sure you capture pictures with clear and sharp details.   The 8 MP front camera features face recognition technology and beauty mode, which helps remove blemishes and improves brightness. The low-light shots turned out to be quite clear as well. In short, both the camera, front, and back are indeed pretty decent.   Check out all the high-resolution image samples here  in this link .  Connectivity  Huawei Y7 Prime packs 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, FM Radio, Bluetooth v4.1, GPS and micro USB 2.0. The phone supports 2 Sim cards. However, since it is hybrid you can use either 2 SIM card or 1 SIM card and micro SD at a time.  CONCLUSION  In a nutshell, the Huawei Y7 is a fascinating phone having a long lasting and efficient battery, sharp and clear display and a decent pair of cameras at a low budget. This brings a tough competition for other phones within this range. So, if you are looking for a phone with good specs but have a tight budget, I would definitely recommend Huawei Y7 to be befitting.      Pros of Huawei Y7  Cons of Huawei Y7    Excellent Battery Life  Heating Issue    Good sets of cameras  Hybrid SIM slots    Bigger display on a budget']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Huawei-y7-review.jpg']

The hustle of tech enthusiasts was a sight to see as a huge number of people thronged into the event area every day. However, people who had been to CAN Infotech over the years shared that the event was distasteful. And they were somewhat true. Last year there were only a few stalls that actually caught my eye and intrigued me with their innovative products. So, this year, I was all excited to see how officials would rectify their errors that have prevailed over the years and conduct an event that would be innovative, to say the least.  The technology sector in Nepal is booming like never before, and people from every nook and corner of the country are being attracted towards this field. And CAN Infotech, being the holy grail of displaying some amazing tech-related ideas or gadgets, attracts a lot of audiences. I got to visit CAN Infotech 2018 yesterday, and I have to say I wasn’t impressed with what I saw. Now please note that I am not in anyway against CAN or the event it organizes, and I have the utmost respect for all the exhibitioners who put in a lot of effort to make the event a success. However, the Infotech I visited yesterday was boring and looked more like a business expo with only a few stalls with interesting products and innovations.  Let’s start with the positives. I got to see a lot of startup companies at CAN Infotech this year. These startups have turned over a lot of heads with their new ideas and inventions. The visitors seemed interested in these companies and their aims. Companies like BeeCreative, Foodmario, Sarathi Cab, Sagoon, Khalti, Sajilo Marmat Sewa, etc. are using the event’s platform to pitch their product to the audience, so, make sure you visit their respective stalls.        Huawei  finally launched the  Mate 10 Pro  here in Nepal making use of the CAN platform. The company has priced the device at Rs. 103,900 which means that it will directly go up against the  Samsung Galaxy Note 8 . The company is also advertising the  Huawei Nova 2i  in the event. There was no Matebook X in their stall, though.  Sony is offering discounts on its products at the CAN Infotech. The  Xperia XA ,  Xperia L1 Dual , and  Xperia X  are my pick of the bunch. Also, be sure to check the discounts on the company’s TVs.  There are also some notable products like My Lockey which is a USB dongle that encrypts data via a fingerprint scanner, and Texas College’s e-library. The organizers of Locus 2018 were also at the CAN, advertising their event which is starting from February 2. Also, companies like Growth Sellers and PUM are pitching their ideas to the visitors in the event.  Last year’s CAN Infotech included lots of multinational companies and some of the heavy hitters of the Nepali tech industry. However, this year, lots of popular brands didn’t invest on CAN Infotech, and that’s probably due to the decreasing quality of the event. Companies like Samsung, Vianet, and Oppo, are not present and that’s probably because they think their investment isn’t bearing fruits. And personally, I think other companies should follow. CAN Infotech is meant to showcase the on-going technological advancement in the country. But these days, it is turning out to be a business expo. If companies just want to sell their products, why don’t they do it in New Road? And why is a leather bag manufacturer exhibiting its products at CAN Infotech? I don’t see the connection between a leather bag and a tech event.  I was also disappointed with the mobile companies as they only showed off their older products. Ocean Computers (Importer of MSI in Nepal) and Nagmani International (Importer of ASUS in Nepal) are selling their products with a huge margin in the event.  Now let’s talk about ISPs. Worldlink and Subisu are luring consumers with discounts on annual packages. That’s great for the new customers but what about the old ones? Shouldn’t they also be focusing on the customers who are already there?  There are lots of exhibitioners at CAN Infotech this year. And from what I saw, there are only a few stalls that are actually interesting. Even though some products that have caught the visitors’ eyes, there is not one single stall with a ‘wow’ factor.  Three years ago, we had written an article on CAN Infotech 2015. Fast-forward three years, the shortcomings that were mentioned in the article still prevail. Even though it was the second day of the event yesterday, the stalls were still under construction. Likewise, the loud blaring speakers are distracting as ever. I had a hard time figuring out where the respective stalls were located at. It would have been much better if the stalls were organized according to their category. For example stalls that showcase smartphones can be placed at one end of the venue while stalls related to computers and laptops can be placed at the other end. This will certainly help the visitors and make the event more managed.  So, all-in-all, CAN Infotech 2018 was a disappointing event for me. CAN has yet to rectify the mistakes it has been making for the last few years. The event had made a name for itself due to the tech it showcased, not because of leather bags or by selling laptops from unauthorized sellers. CAN Infotech these days is like a business expo more than an event regarding technological advancement in Nepal. Hopefully, next year when the 2019 edition starts, the association will focus more on what it actually stands for rather than how much it can earn!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CAN-infotech-2018.jpg']

['UMIDIGI C Note Full Review: How Good is this Note?'],"['Android', 'Reviews', 'UMIDIGI']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['January 26, 2018']",2018-01-26 04:10:10+00:00,"['2017 was the year of Chinese smartphones in Nepal. Even though a certain manufacturer still has more market share, the growth they had was rapid. We were also introduced to some of the new players last year which included UMIDIGI. UMIDIGI launched a few devices the previous year in which the C Note and the Crystal stood out. So, I put the C note through a series of test, and here is my full review of the device.  Also Read:   UMIDIGI Mobiles Price in Nepal  UMIDIGI C Note Specifications   5.5-inch (1080 x 1920 pixels) full HD SHARP 2.5D curved display  Gorilla Glass protection  1.5GHz Quad-core MediaTek MT6737T processor  3GB RAM; 32GB internal memory, expandable with microSD up to 256GB  Android v7.0 (Nougat)  13MP rear camera with Samsung S5K3L8 sensor, PDAF, dual LED flash  5MP front camera  Dual Hybrid SIM (Nano+Nano/TF Card) with 4G LTE  Front-mounted fingerprint sensor  Full Metal Body  3800 mAh non-removable battery  UMIDIGI C Note Price in Nepal: Rs. 20,900   Display and Design          If its price is considered, the UMIDIGI C Note is the only device to come with a full HD display in its price range. Even with a low price tag, the display is vibrant, full of happening and has an adequate brightness that does well under the brightest of lights. However, the first thing you notice about the screen how unnatural the text look while watching videos. They lack sharpness and look pixelated. I didn’t face this issue when I read a couple of articles on the device, though. And if you do a lot of reading, the device also has an option to toggle the screen’s color temperature according to a user’s necessity.   This display is cloaked by a pretty-looking metallic body on the back. The aluminum body is premium, and it makes the device feel like it’s worth more than its actual price. There is a camera accompanied by a LED flash sitting on the rear side. Although there is only a single primary camera, UMIDIGI has made it look as if there is a dual camera setup on the phone. A fingerprint sensor bottom bezel at the front with an earpiece and sensors on the top. The bottom bezel also houses capacitive keys.  Software   The capacitive keys are one of the features I didn’t like on the device. To check the recently used apps, I had to long press the home button, which is an outdated Android feature that takes up a lot of time and is really annoying. But I later found out that the keys can be toggled to the virtual ones. Another feature that’s outdated, software wise, is the icons and the menu. But one of the best thing about Android is customization. So, of course, I changed both of them.  These are the only issues I had with the software front of the UMIDIGI C Note. One of the unique traits of this device is that there were no applications from Google installed right out of the box, excluding the Play Store. I had to download the ones I needed. All in all, the C Note is free of unnecessary bloatware and provides a near-stock experience.  Performance  The software also helps boost the performance due to the lack of bloatware in the device. The UMIDIGI C Note with its MediaTek processor and 3GB RAM handles almost everything thrown at it. There were, however, rare stutters while gaming. Also, a few minutes after playing games like Asphalt and Dream Soccer League, the area right below the primary camera started to warm up. I was really worried, but after gaming for a couple of hours, the heat didn’t actually increase. Other than this issue, the device didn’t give up on me. Multitasking was good too, except for the time some apps took to load up.  The UMIDIGI C Note scored 39665 on Antutu which is a little bit less than what Nokia 5 ( 45274), Xiaomi Redmi 4X (43431), and Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt (41777).   UMIDIGI C Note Antutu Benchmark Comparison  Infogram  \xa0  Battery   Now I know a 3,800 mAh battery sounds very really great. But that was not the case in real life usage. Its battery has this unusual bug due to which once its charge decreased to 20%, the battery died a couple of minutes later. I thought this was just an issue in my review unit, but the same has been mentioned in a couple of other reviews of the C Note.  The device gave me a screen-on-time of 3 and half hours – 4 hours under heavy usage. I gamed, browsed through the internet, took a few pictures, and watched a couple of videos. Even my primary smartphone that has a 3,000 mAh battery gives me 4 hours of screen-on-time. And that’s not the only disappointing fact about the battery. Due to a lack of any kind of fast charging support, it took me around 3 hours just to juice up the battery. I know we can’t really expect that feature in a device worth 20,000, but 3-hours is a long time.  Camera                            On the camera side, the C Note houses a 13-megapixel lens that is nothing to be home about. It takes decent pictures at its best, and when you zoom into them, they lose details. The pictures I took lacked good sharpness, accurate colors, and saturation. And like most of the device of its price range, it fails to shine under low-light settings. The pictures come off way too noisy and grainy. They are washed out and lack the proper colors. The same goes for the selfie camera.  \xa0            UMIDIGI C Note Selfie Sample   The 5-megapixel lens takes washed out images. But since the camera is not the USP of the device, you are good to go if you only take a few pictures every day and are okay with posting decent selfies on your social media accounts.  Sensors and Hardware    On the front glass panel of the UMIDIGI C Note sits a fingerprint scanner that can unlock the smartphone in around 0.50 seconds. The scanner never gave up on me once, so, it is completely reliable. The bottom of the device has dual mono speakers which are loud and don’t get covered up easily. Between these speakers is a microUSB port for connectivity purpose. To make way for the speakers, UMIDIGI has placed the headphone jack on top of the device. The UMIDIGI C Note comes equipped with 32 GB of internal memory which can be expanded up to 256 GB via a microSD card. However, you will have to choose between a microSD card and an extra SIM card as it has a hybrid SIM slot.  Conclusion  So, to round off this review, the UMIDIGI C Note is a device that has a great display and a premium build quality. The Chinese company has included a near-stock software in a device that performs really well. However, even though it houses a big battery, the battery life is unsatisfactory and the bug it has is a huge-huge let off. Also, the camera lenses are only decent. But if you can oversee the battery issue and want a smartphone that feels premium and has a crisp display, you should get the UMIDIGI C Note.  If you’re not impressed with the UMIDIGI C Note, you might want to take a look at devices like the  Xiaomi Redmi 4X ,  Nokia 5  or  Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt .

Such smartphones with high screen-to-body ratio are usually called smartphones with a bezel-less display. Sharp Aquos smartphone was the first in the game seconded by  Xiaomi MI Mix . Via\xa0 MI Mix , Xiaomi modernized the concept inspiring lots of smartphone manufacturers. As the LG admired and abruptly adopted the concept on the  LG G6  (launched on  MWC 2017 ), every other smartphone brands are now on the verge of bidding farewell to the bezels. Remarking that each front part of the phone that is not a pixel is a waste, every smartphone manufacturers are opting for bezel-less displays these days.  Bezel-less smartphones are not just elegant on the looks because of their all screen body but also comfortable on the use despite having a huge screen. So it obviously is a great privilege to own such smartphones. But which smartphones features such kind of display and are available in Nepal? That may be the striking question to the many. So here, we present you the list of all the screen-centric smartphones or smartphones with  bezel-less display  available in Nepal.  iPhone X         iPhone X  is currently the most expensive smartphone available in Nepal. Features like FaceID, Animojis, powerful neural processor and the impressive set of cameras are not just remarkable with the phone but also its display and the design language.  Apple  ditched the TouchID (or fingerprint sensor) to go full bezel-less. However, there is still some bezel left contributing only 82.9% of the front portion of the screen.  The display on the device is enunciated as ‘Super Retina display’, which is actually a Super AMOLED one imported from  Samsung . Also, the display on the device possesses a size of 5.8-inches featuring a resolution of 1125 x 2436 pixels in 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The display on the device is crowded with 458 pixels in every inch.

Xiaomi MI Mix  As mentioned earlier,  Xiaomi MI Mix  is the first renowned name to ditch the bezels (though, not entirely), which had enthralled the world with its courage and innovation. Shifting the Ambient light sensor and front camera on the chin, Xiaomi MI Mix bade farewell to the top bezel. But where and how did they adjusted the earpiece and proximity sensor? This curiosity may reside among the most. To answer it in simple terms, they replaced that by a high tech system and packed them inside the device. As a replacement to the proximity sensor, which generally uses Infrared sensors, they used Ultrasonic sensor and inserted the system behind the screen. This new kind of setup works perfectly fine without creating a fuss. On the other hand, for replacing the earpiece, they used “cantilever piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology” instead of putting a slab of the speaker on the top bezel.   Though Xiaomi boasted to have 91.3% screen-to-body ratio on the MI Mix, it has 83.6% in real. That is not bad either. However, with the 6.4-inch screen and 4400mAh battery, MI Mix falls on the heavy side with 209 grams. The display on the device has Full-HD+ (2040 x 1080 pixels) resolution and features 17:9 aspect ratio. The resolution results in a Pixel density of 362PPI.

The upper bezel has provided an accommodation for the proximity sensor, earpiece, selfie shooter and the Iris Scanner. With the fingerprint sensor shifted to the back and capacitive buttons replaced by the on-screen one, the lower bezel is basically empty in the Galaxy S8 & S8+.

UMIDIGI Crystal   Ditching the bezels seems to be the sole intention of the  UMIDIGI Crystal  as it has kept itself away from 18:9 aspect ratio gimmick. Alike the Xiaomi MI Mix, it has tossed all the upper bezels to the trash with just some on the chin, where the front camera dwells. The 5.5-inch display on the device features Full-HD resolution packing 401 pixels in every inch. The display on the device covers 78.9% of the front panel, which is protected by Gorilla Glass 4 to evade the vulnerabilities of cracks and scratches.  Micromax Canvas Infinity   For those enthusiasts, who seek for a smartphone with trendy and eye-catching design at a cheaper price point,  Micromax Canvas Infinity  is the name. Priced at Rs. 18,500, the device possesses an immersive 5.7-inch display, which features an HD+ resolution at 18:9 aspect ratio. IPS LCD is employed on the device, which occupies 77.2% of the front panel. The display on the device has a pixel density of 282PPI.

['Huawei Nova 2i vs Oppo F5 Camera Comparison: Quad cameras vs Selfie Expert'],"['Huawei', 'OPPO']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['January 21, 2018']",2018-01-21 03:23:21+00:00,"['It won’t be wrong to say that 2017 was a great year for mid-range smartphones here in Nepal. We got to see some pretty great devices in a price that fit everyone’s pockets. Even though 2017 has come to an end, the battle of the mid-range devices still prevails. And today we are here to compare two of the most popular devices of last year – the  Huawei Nova 2i  and the  Oppo F5 .  The Huawei Nova 2i boasts four cameras in total – two at the back and two at the front. Huawei claims that it is the first smartphone to manage this feat and we did indeed put the device to our test.  Oppo , on the other hand, has touted its camera to “capture the real you”, and, on paper, its camera department looks very strong, equipping a 16-megapixel rear camera and a 20-megapixel front camera. The Chinese manufacturer has embedded the selfie camera with Artificial Intelligence which, according to Oppo, can beautify a selfie perfectly regardless of a user’s age or sex.        Well, the manufacturers sure have concentrated a lot in the camera department of their respective smartphones, but which one of the two really stands out? We tested both the devices for quite some time, and here is our final verdict.  Let’s start with something both the devices shine in – taking pictures under bright light.   In well-lit settings, both the smartphones take good pictures. There is no difference between the Nova 2i and the F5 if the saturation of the pictures is taken into consideration. Take the two pictures as examples, here the saturation the doors in both the pictures look similar. We failed at focusing on our subjects properly on the Nova 2i, but both the pictures have come out with similar saturation.   Now you might have noticed a warmer tone in the picture taken by the Huawei Nova 2i. This is clearly seen in the picture above. Even with a slightly warmer tone, the pictures look good as the color tone of the whole picture is natural. The Oppo F5, on the other hand, takes pictures with a pinkish tint. Now the pink shade helps capture red, pink or orange colors quite effectively but if green, blue or any other colors are taken into consideration, the hue is quite unnatural and slightly disoriented. So, the color reproduction is much better on the Huawei Nova 2i in real-life.   Since the Huawei Nova 2i overexposes the images, it was really hard for us to determine the contrast level of the device. Oppo, too, couldn’t quite pop the contrast in this image. And it is evident that the pinkish tint has shifted the colors in the image to what seems like unnatural in the Oppo F5.  Shot on Huawei Nova 2i.  The plus point the Nova 2i has over the F5 is its ability to capture images with a shallow depth of field. The Oppo F5 come engraved with a single camera lens against the  dual camera setup  on the 2i. The dual 13MP and 2MP lenses can intelligently determine where it needs to edge out the background blur. This is something that the Oppo F5 completely misses out on.  Oppo F5 selfie samples.  What the Oppo F5 has really cashed in on is the selfie shooter of the device. Its front houses a 20-megapixel selfie shooter which, like I mentioned before, has AI inside. So, I put that to the test and the first thing I noticed in the picture is that I lost the mole on my forehead. This is a strange thing to see as the AI here has tried to beautify the selfie so much that it has completely gone out of hand.  Huawei Nova 2i selfie samples.  The Huawei Nova 2i’s dual front-facing cameras, on the other hand, takes bokeh pictures just like their companions on the back. Now I am not saying that the Oppo F5’s selfie shooter is bad, it takes better pictures than the front camera setup of the other device under well-lit environment. But the excessive beautifying of the images is certainly a turn-off.   Now taking pictures in dark environment is always tricky, only a few devices can claim to be the perfect night-time companion right now. On our test, the pictures taken from OPPO F5 seemed better as the colors looked vibrant and appealing in the above picture. However, the colors were unnatural and the pinkish tint has enhanced the shades of red color, which are dominating in the above image. The Nova 2i’s image, on the other hand, seemed slightly washed out. But in reality, the colors are quite natural and a little shift in the color is because of the prevalent warmer tone. Noise level is pretty much the same on both devices.  Under similar settings, taking pictures from the front-camera of the Oppo F5 was pleasing to the eye as it tries to make the images more detailed without increasing the grains. Huawei, meanwhile, tried to remove the grains by increasing the noise in the selfies under dark conditions. Also, the lights in the background look different than they did in normal life in the picture taken from the 2i. So, the Oppo F5 does better while taking selfies in such conditions as compared to the Huawei Nova 2i.  CONCLUSION  So, which smartphone should you choose if you are in the market for a camera smartphone? Well, that depends. If you are into selfies, maybe you should buy the Oppo F5. You should tolerate the occasion obliteration of moles, scars, and acne in the selfies. And another compromise you should make with the device is its average rear camera. The rear camera fails to depict the details like the way Nova 2i does. The pink tint and resulting disorientation of color and the inefficient HDR mode would be another downside with the device.  Also Read:\xa0 OPPO F5 Review: The Pretentious Selfie Expert  But if you want to up your photography game, go for the Huawei Nova 2i. Although it tends to overexpose images at times, the device certainly takes better real-life pictures. Amount of details in images is simply mind-blowing with the device even in the low light and how could one miss the fancy portrait selfies? The pleasing Bokeh shots from the rear camera and good amount of color saturation is another remarkable feature of the device. The inefficient HDR mode may be repellent at times but rest of the features are really praiseworthy that’s why it is one of the  best mid-range camera smartphones in Nepal .

One of the great innovations is Moviphone with a built-in projector. So you have another great option on the list if you are looking for a portable projector.  Although it isn’t the first of its kind, it is without a doubt the most advanced. The astonishing innovation has grasped a lot of attention since it was showcased at CES. The device is already up for order starting at $599( which comes to around Rs 70,000 in Nepal).  The feature focus of Movi phone is, it doesn’t have any extra accessories\xa0or mods on the smartphone for projection. So basically, to cut out any bulk or additional weight it already is integrated into the body. Movi phone offers an inbuilt “Projection App” that lets you start/stop the projection. Movi phone’s projector offers a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels along with autofocusing and auto keystone.         Having keystone on a pico projector is a convenient addition, you can easily straighten a slanted projection on the wall. The phone\xa0uses laser projection technology to project a 720p image up to 100 inches in size. That’s plenty enough to cover a whole wall creating a theatrical experience to enjoy movies and games. But the brightness rating offered by this device is 50 lumens. It’s decent for a pocket projector but a dark room is required for proper visibility. Also going full 100-inch won’t result in a good experience with this brightness.  The device feels almost like any other mid-range Android phone. It comes with a unibody metal construct with a 5.5-inch full HD display. It doesn’t look bad like the other Android hybrids we have witnessed. The phone is just 10.28mm thick, which is a really slim form factor compared to any pico projectors. Movi phone is powered\xa0by a quad-core 32 bit MediaTek processor clocked at 1.5GHZ. It offers a 4,000mAH battery which is large for any smartphone. With this chunky battery, the company promises around 4 hours of projection. Plenty enough for two movies! On the bright side, it also offers fast charging with its 5V 5A charger which should juice up the phone within 1.5 hours or so.   Two configurations of 3GB + 32GB and 4GB + 64GB is provided. And if it is not enough to store your multimedia contents then the storage can be further expandable using a microSD card. The phone has a 13-megapixel camera with PDAF and LED flash on the rear and\xa0an\xa08-megapixel shooter with fixed focus and soft LED flash on the front. It boots on stock Android Nougat. Connectivity options include Wifi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth\xa04.1,\xa0A-GPS, Audio jack, FM radio, and USB OTG support.

CES (Consumers Electronics Show) not only highlights the new and exciting technologies but also projects a little bit of tech industry throughout the year. With technologies and gadgets showcased in burst mode, here is the list of some best technologies and gadgets showcased by LG at  CES 2018  in Las Vegas, Nevada.  65-inch rollable OLED TV  Watching on the big screen is always a fun, be it a movie, video or the football. However, big display consumes more space they turn out to be a huge burden when not in use. So with a view to eradicating such inconveniences, LG developed 65-inch OLED TV, which is not just capable of reproducing vivid colors but also is rollable. This is an unprecedented feature on a TV, which reduces the space issues to great extent.         Video Credits: BBC  LG had also showcased its 18-inch foldable and rollable TV back in 2016. However, this time around LG has not just increased the size of the TV but also made it adjustable to a different aspect ratio. This OLED has a long rectangular base and the TV hides within the base when not in use. The users can watch the information like news and weather in a small display. While watching movies, the aspect ratio of 21:9 is often preferred and this OLED TV can be brought to that aspect ratio too. And if one wants to enjoy the whole of its gargantuan display, one can always to the traditional 16:9 display.  This rollable OLED TV possesses Ultra HD display (3840 x 2160 pixels) and the colors pop out with an accurate natural tone. Because of its unprecedented portability, this TV gained lots of attention in the show and most visitors wished to own such TVs. However, this TV was just a prototype during the show and LG has not planned for its mass reproduction.  LG TVs lineup 2018  The successor to the W7, LG brought the 65-inch wallpaper style LG W8 TV for the year 2018. This 65-inch TV is also equipped with a 4.2 Dolby Atmos sound bar attached via a flat cable.  There is also the LG G8. Available in the size of 65 and 77 inches, the LG G8 TV also uses the same panel and processor as that of the W8. However, to add a little difference, this TV has desktop design and a small built-in soundbar.  Also Read:  LG TVs Price in Nepal  With the thinner sound bar and more subtle audio, LG E8 presented itself better than the last year’s E7. But LG claimed that there will be no change in volume despite the size of the sound bar. This TV has continued the use of ‘Pixel in glass’ design, however, this time around, the glass section has extended near to the metal stand at the bottom.   LG C8 and B8 were also showcased at the event. However, these TVs lacked the changes and were indistinguishable to their 2017 counterparts. The same pixels-on-glass design can be seen in the two in the same super-slim OLED attires.  Though the new OLED TVs lack tangible improvements over its predecessors, the inclusion of “Alpha 9” processor and Google Assistant is somewhat praiseworthy. This OLED TV comes with webOS blended the Google Assistant. The webOS seems nothing different from the last year’s webOS 3.5. However, because of the Google Assistant, some AI-related activities are seamless with the device. These new OLEDs can also handle the high frame rate of 12Hz over USB, broadcast and streaming sources. However, this feature is only supported with 1080p resolutions from extended sources connected with HDMI.  88-inch 8K OLED TV   As the title cues, this OLED TV is an absolute record breaker. This 88-inch 8K OLED TV from LG is not just enormous in size but also overwhelming in terms of resolution. The 8K display (7,680 x 4,320 pixels) is four times as sharper as the 4K display and 16 times sharper than the Full-HD display. And with thin bezels to wrap the display, this TV would show the lively pictures on it. And with the OLED panels, the colors are accurate with natural-like colors reproduction. Because of the clarity, color accuracy, and immersiveness his TV can definitely fool the eyes.  LG V30 in new Color   V30 is the current flagship of LG. The smartphone was already impressive in terms of specs and in this CES 2018, it just welcomed another color variant. Called as  LG V30  Raspberry Rose, this new color variant possesses electric pink hue.  LG Gram Laptops  Most of the Ultrabooks come with one major issue, Webcam placed below the screen. And LG Gram laptops have tried to fix that issue by placing it on the top. The new laptops were unveiled in the event, which was brought in three different sizes, 13.3-inch, 14-inch, and 15.6 inches. These new laptops are also powerful and efficient at the same time. Provided with 8 th  generation Intel Core I5 and I7 processors, these laptops offer a great performance additionally. These laptops are provided with 72Wh batteries, which provide 22.5, 21.5 and 19 hours backup on 13.3-inch, 14-inch and 15.6-inch laptops respectively.   These laptops are also durable and are impressively resistant to impacts, temperature, and pressure. The new Gram laptops passed seven MIL-STD 810G durability tests, all thanks to its new nano-carbon magnesium shell. LG Gram laptops are also remarkably light. The base model or the one with 13.3-inch weighs 961 grams, whereas, its 14-inch and 15.6-inch counterparts weigh 993 and 1095 grams respectively.  Furthermore, there is also the privilege of upgrades. One can always enhance these laptops further with touchscreens, fingerprint readers, and Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports. The touchscreen upgrades can be done without a major compromise in the thickness, all thanks to the new IPS In-cell Touch Technology by LG. This technology by LG offers haptic control without distorting colors while touching the panel.  ThinQ Smart Home Solution  Provided with the ThinQ technology, LG brought a smartphone speaker to the event. To say in simple words, this is a new version of  Google Home \xa0made by LG. LG has claimed that this device offers a “premium sounding” experience that works with high-quality lossless files.

The laptop comes with its own flip\xa0cover attached to keyboard and kickstand. The keyboard is\xa0backlit and on it’s right, there’s a stylus pen.

For this very reason, Microsoft calls these laptops ‘Always Connected.’ Lenovo Miix\xa0630 is running on Windows\xa010 S. It is a secure and ultra-limited version of Windows 10. It\xa0packs Microsoft goodness like the Windows Hello Face Unlock with the included 5MP IR camera and Cortana Voice Assistant. It holds a 13MP camera on the back as well.

For peripherals, it comes with a single USB 3.1 C port for charging and data syncing, card reader and headphone jack.

At CES 2018, Dell has launched the 2018 version of XPS 15 which is dubbed as the world’s slimmest and most powerful 15-inch laptop. How and Why we’ll get to that part later, but first let’s check out few of the new upgrades this laptop has\xa0received.  The first thing that we shouldn’t\xa0 forget to mention, this is the first 2-in-1 convertible in XPS lineup. So if you want to use it as a tablet you can just flip it and do so. This has been possible because of the slim form factor with just 16mm of thickness. As the name suggests, the XPS 15 is a 15.6-inch laptop that you can get in 2 variants, either with a 4K display or a full HD display. No matter the panel of choice you’ll get 100% Adobe RGB color, meaning doing graphic sensitive works and other kinds of stuff you’ll have colors that are as real as it can get. The display like the previous gens is touch enabled.         But to our surprise, Dell has introduced a Stylus pen\xa0that goes along with the laptop. The stylus has 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity and tilts to assist in more detailed sketching. It is magnetic so you can stick it to few designated surface of the laptop. It has to be bought separately although the price has not be quoted yet.  Image: Trusted Reviews  The new and somewhat refreshing update that the new XPS 15 has received is its keyboard. It uses a new keyboard mechanism called maglev. The keys are shallow with just 0.7mm travel but the magnets beneath each key\xa0tend to provide the feel of more travel by controlling their strength of repulsion. Maglev ensures that there is less friction so the keyboard should be more durable. Talking about buttons, the XPS 15 also receives a fingerprint scanner on its power button. You can also unlock the laptop with your face with the Windows Hello feature.   The Dell XPS 15 2-in-1 has received an upgrade in terms of performance as well. It houses one of the first hybrid chips built jointly by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It has8th Gen Intel Quad CoreTM i7-8705G processor with RadeonTM RX Vega M GL graphics (8MB cache, up to 4.1GHz) on the same chipset. Due to this hybrid nature, the motherboard is now 50% smaller. This has mainly contributed to the laptops thin form factor. Because the processor and graphics unit is together the thermals would be managed better as well. The\xa0RadeonTM RX Vega M GL graphics will provide performance comparable to the GTX 1050. Not only can you run power intensive apps but you can easily game on it as well. You can get up to 32GB of RAM and up to\xa01TB PCIe SSD. Dell promises about 15 hours of backup from this laptop.  Talking about peripherals, it has 4 USB C ports, out of which two are Thunderbolt 3 with full 4 PCIe lanes. It has a\xa0headphone jack and a microSD card.

But it’s not, it’s just a really big drone that can fly really fast, so there are a lot of possible use for it. It does have a capacity to deliver high spraying performance to meet the needs of today’s farmers. It is also pretty lightweight, easy to use and very reliable.   Fazer R  The Fazer R is a helicopter, not bigger than the YMR-01. So it’s unmanned and can keep flying in paths that are evenly spaced. This makes it a really useful tool for farmers or the agricultural industry in general. Think of a really big farm that needs water or pesticides, and a helicopter that can do the exact same.

There have been rumors of\xa0Apple and Samsung exploring under-display fingerprint scanning technology for over a year. However, China’s Vivo is the first smartphone brand to launch an in-display\xa0fingerprint sensor.  Vivo previously partnered with Qualcomm for this very objective at MWC Shanghai 2017. As explained in the presentation, the in-display fingerprint scanning technology on the upcoming Vivo smartphone sits between the glass protection and OLED panel.Vivo then decided to go with the Synaptics as the Qualcomm powered fingerprint sensing display prototype wasn’t much of a success. Partnered with Synaptics, Vivo launched the first smartphone in the world with a fingerprint sensor under the display.         Features in Vivo In-display Fingerprint Scanner  Mainly developed for thin-bezel OLED display panels with the taller-than-usual 18:9 aspect ratio. The widely available fingerprint sensing solutions are replaced by the Synaptics clear ID sensors, fulfilling the goal of its designing. The CMOS image sensor is 0.7mm thick and reads fingerprint through the OLED display. However, it takes 0.7 seconds to unlock. A bit longer other fingerprint scanners we are using right now. Also, it takes almost two seconds to register a scan while teaching the phone your fingerprint but the cool scanning animation makes the wait worthwhile.  Nevertheless, it is much faster than Face Unlock feature which takes more than a second. Other benefits of the scanner will be that it is scratch-proof and waterproof.\xa0It’s not clearly\xa0specified when this Vivo smartphone with an in-display fingerprint scanner\xa0will launch or how much it’ll cost. However, Vivo may want to replace that micro-USB port on the bottom with a USB-C one. But the device does prove that the\xa0 Clear ID technology works smoothly.  Many other companies might come up with this technology.

The giants have, however, confirmed that they will announce the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ at the Mobile World Congress which is slated to start February 2016.  DJ Koh, chief for Samsung’s mobile business, confirmed this during a press briefing in Las Vegas.  The Samsung Galaxy S8 and the S8+ were arguably the best smartphones of 2017. They brought Samsung right back to where it was – top of the ‘food chain’. And it is obvious that the Korean company wants to emulate last year’s success with this year’s devices.        However, some media outlets have reported that the Galaxy S9 could be $190 more expensive than its predecessor. Last year’s Galaxy Note 8 was a tab bit expensive too, with prices starting at $996.  DJ Koh also used the platform at CES to state that Samsung will come up with Bixby 2.0 in 2018. Bixby is Samsung’s personal smart assistant that wasn’t able to make much of an impact when it was launched into the world of smartphones last year. Samsung’s mobile President also mentioned that all Samsung devices will support Bixby by 2020.  Various pictures of the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ have appeared online showcasing how Samsung has rectified its mistake of placing a fingerprint scanner alongside the camera lens. The Samsung Galaxy S9+ will probably be the first smartphone from the S-series to come equipped with dual lenses on the back.  We are still in dark about the exact pricing and release date of the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+. It will probably hit the stores in March and launch here in Nepal sometime later.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/galaxy-s9-launch-date.png']

The first thing you need to know about this laptop is its cost. For an asking price of Rs 1,40,000, it does justify it’s price, except for a few minor problems. Also, the price of $1,300 in Amazon America does fair well with its pricing in Nepal as well.   MSI GE62VR Apache Pro Specs  Display : 15.6 inch IPS  Processor : i7 6700HQ Quadcore up to  Graphics Card : Nvidia GTX 1060 (3GB)  RAM :\xa016GB DDR4 (up to 32GB)  SSD : 256GB  Hard Drive : 1TB  Optical Drive : Yes  Battery :\xa051Whr (load 1h21m/idle 3h30m)  Price : Rs 1,45,000        Also Read:  Top Gaming Laptops Under NRs. 1,50,000 in Nepal  Build  The build is one of the main disadvantages of this laptop. There is very less screen and body flex, which is nice and the hinge is stiff as well. But the top of the laptop is a smudge magnet and the bottom suffers from a lot of flex and creeks which makes it feel non-premium. The laptop is also quite thick, which helps a lot with thermals although the laptop feels pretty lightweight at 2.4Kgs.  We did face a problem with one of the fans on the laptop. It isn’t anything serious and the vendor was more than happy to replace it under warranty. It’s not really a deal breaker but according to the information we got, this is a very common problem in this particular series.  Display  The laptop has a full HD IPS panel with a maximum 60Hz refresh rate. The viewing angles, color accuracy, and brightness levels are all decent. With a score of 54.4 on Adobe RGB test and 84.4 on SRGB test, they are pretty overwhelming.\xa0  It goes without saying that a gaming laptop isn’t a device you want as a dedicated Adobe machine. But if you happen to be someone who wants the best of both worlds, maybe consider this as an option. The display is still better than a lot of other laptops at this price point anyway.  Also Read:\xa0 Dell Inspiron 7567 Review: Best Budget Gaming Laptop?  Performance  Performance is one of the strong points of this laptop. The Core i7-6700HQ is still a well capable chipset reaching speeds of up to 3.5Ghz. It’s a Quad-Core processor with 4 cores and 8 threads so not much to complain here.  It also has 16GB of single-channel 2133MHz DDR4 RAM, which is ok but a 2400MHz one would have been better. You also have the option to upgrade to 32GB but could hold off on that until you are sure you need it.  Gaming Performance  The GTX 1060 that this laptop feature is surely one of the best in this price category. Although this one holds just 3GB of GDDR5 VRAM, the performance is no joke.\xa0 This is literally the perfect laptop for 1080p gaming. Triple-A titles will cross the 60fps sweet spot on high settings with ease.  The laptop is VR capable as well.    Thermals  The laptop doesn’t run much hot either. But in case if it does there’s a dedicated key to turn the fans to their max capacity giving you the optimum cooling possible whenever required. Although it is pretty noisy and irritating if you keep it on all the time. We recommend a good pair of headphones for extensive gaming marathons.  While playing graphics intensive games, the laptop stayed comfortably warm.  The left wrist rest does get hot on some occasion though, but all in all, the laptop stays comfortable to use. It is also quite thick which might have helped a lot with the thermals.\xa0  Storage  Storage wise you get a 256GB SSD and a 1TB hard drive. The SSD scored 500Mbps read and 300mbps write speeds, which is pretty average. The good thing is they are easily swappable, so a faster or larger storage options are easily accessible. The 1TB hard drive is also decently fast at 7200RPM, which is also easily swappable.  The OS runs pretty well and you can ddefinitelysee a slight advantage over a 5400RPM drive. Game loading times are immensely quick as compared to the hard disk, but that’s a given. Although if you are coming from a hard disk-based system, you will be really happy with the experience.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The k eyboard is RGB backlit, with three configure zones, giving you that gaming vibe. There is a wide variety of ways the keyboard’s lighting can be customized, but after a while, you might just revert back and stick to one constant color. The keyboard itself is pretty nice, with good key travel and satisfyingly clicky buttons.  The touchpad, on the other hand, was quite a disappointment. It is usable but, let’s just say it’s not that good. Although considering the nature of the laptop, one could care less about it.  Connectivity  The laptop is equipped with killer Wi-Fi onboard, with decent speeds and range, one can rely on it for online gaming. I would personally use the LAN for lower latency but wireless is also an option.  The laptop also features some decent external speakers, but there is a little tear in the sound quality at high volumes, and pair them with the extensively loud fans and you will be better off with headphones.  Battery Life  The mediocre 51Whr battery on a system this big is a bummer. With the battery capable of about 2 and a half hours of normal usage and less than an hour of game time. A gaming oriented laptop was hardly going to last longer than this anyway.  So, for 1,40,000 you get a sixth gen quad core i7 with 16GB of DDR4 RAM, a well-cooled GTX 1060 graphics, and a decent display. If you are looking for a portable gaming system then this will easily satisfy you. The price you will be shelling out for the laptop is well worth it and the performance this delivers is top notch.

Contributing to ‘made in Nepal’ development for the production of goods, five Nepali youths have given it a bit different direction and produced an electric wheelchair.  ‘ Leopard ’ is a chargeable vehicle which can run for approximately two hours and a half when fully charged. The top speed of the wheelchair is 10 KM per hour. The charging time of Leopard is just three hours after which it can run for 25 kilometers straight.  The inventors are:  Suneel Pariyar, Santosh Raj Neupane, Bharat KC, Prajesh Shrestha, and Mensun Lakhemaru . The team members themselves have also made some financial contribution to the project. CIL (Independent Living Centre), which is an organization for the person with disabilities has funded the team.        Using just the word ‘electric’ is not enough to describe this ‘Leopard’ as it has several other features that lead us to think why actually is this wheelchair worth it. It has a bag beneath the seat for urine disposal. It has a pouch available for the medicines and space for a water bottle as well. It also has GPS tracking system so that the kin of the user can keep a track of where they are and be able to reach them easily whenever they are in need of help.  If all above-mentioned features were not enough, ‘ L eopard ’ has a joystick fitted for the users to control the ‘device’. Not just that, it has quite an impressive look with couch-like seat.  Coming to the wheels, it looks interesting as the bigger wheels are placed in the front while smaller ones at the back, keeping the roads of Kathmandu in mind.   But are they feasible for Nepal and its roads?  Both yes and no. Because with no specific lane for the wheelchairs, it is not as safe. Also, this prototype has no side-view mirrors. This will add to the danger as the user can’t keep a track of the vehicles running behind it, it increases the chance of an accident.  Adding to it, the roads are quite uneven and have pits and holes everywhere. But, one thing that can help is the big wheels in front. The bigger wheels were put at front keeping in mind the condition of roads.  The price tag is what comes to our mind as soon as we get acquainted with the convenience this vehicle provides. It is priced at Rs. 300,000. It is still out of reach for most of the Nepali people from a monetary perspective.  So, what is so good about this wheelchair that we should use it instead of the imported one? Well, the inventors say that it has been built for Nepali roads.  The Finance Minister, Uday Samsher Rana has assured the team that government subsidy will be provided for the manufacturing of these wheelchairs and the taxes would not be levied for the parts to be used for the wheelchair which can reduce the production cost of the wheelchair.  With all the pros and cons mentioned, it’s still too early to make a judgment whether or not will it be useful enough or successful enough. But one thing is for sure that, it is a very positive step towards the convenience of a person with disabilities. Hopefully, the shortcomings will be addressed as soon as possible. We surely will come to an analysis in near future on our own.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/electric-wheelchair.png']

None of them are flagship offerings but Sony did always pride itself on its mid-range offerings anyway. The new smartphones are the third generation installments of their respective series.  Sony Xperia XA2  Stepping up in the footsteps of the XA and the XA1, the XA2 leaves the traditional 5-inch display for a 5.2-inch (500nits) panel. Along with the physical size, the XA2 also features a full HD display. The battery has also been increased to 3300mAh.  It is built on an aluminum frame with a polycarbonate back with colors ranging from silver, black, blue and even pink (nothing we haven’t seen before). It offers Quick Charge 3.0, for obvious reasons as it runs on an octa-core Snapdragon 630 SoC.        The XA2 packs 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage alongside Bluetooth\xa05.0 (seemed like a notable feature). It also comes with Android 8.0 Oreo straight out of the box.  The phone has a fingerprint sensor on the back right below the 23MP f/2.0 aperture camera. The same camera is also capable of video recordings of up to 2160p at 30fps. At the front, it holds a 16MP+8MP camera setup. The 16MP is a f/2.0 sensor with OIS whereas the 8MP f/2.4 is a wide-angle sensor with a FOV of up to 120 degrees. Video recordings maxes\xa0out at 1080p 30fps.  It will have the usual single and dual-SIM variant, 802.11ac wifi, NFC, USB-C port and a 3.5mm\xa0headphone jack. It also has the traditional Sony style dedicated two-stage camera shutter button on the side.  Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra  The XA2 Ultra is quite a cache name, NOT!! It is, however, a big smartphone, with a 6-inch (500 nits) 16:9 display. Anyway, there is no denying it’s a big phone, even though the dimensions have remained constant for about three generations now.  The mediocre Helio P series of SoCs are gone in favor of the Snapdragon 630 SoC. With that, the huge 3580mAh battery is aided by Quick Charge 3.0. The RAM capacity remains at 4GB alongside a 32GB or a 64GB of storage option.  The back is equipped\xa0with a 23MP f/2.0 sensor and a fingerprint sensor. On the sides, there are the volume buttons, power button, and the two-stage camera shutter as well. The front has the exact camera setup as the normal size Xperia XA2.  It also features Bluetooth 5.0, 802.11 ac wifi, USB-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, dual SIM option and comes with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. The increase in battery capacity will help a lot with the overall experience\xa0of the device for sure.  Sony Xperia L2  The Xperia L2 is the low-end smartphone from Sony. It comes with Android 7.1.1 out of the box which will tell you a lot about the device at first glance. It also comes with the same SoC as it’s predecessor, the MediaTek MT6737T, paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internals.  The L2 shares the 5.5-inch 720p display with the L1, what has changed is the battery capacity to a usable 3300mAh. There is a 13MP f/2.0 camera at the back and an 8MP f/2.4 camera at the front.  It gets a USB Type-C port but lacks Bluetooth 5.0 and ac wifi. It does, however, feature a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with black, pink and gold color options. The smartphone does pose a good deal of upgrades over its predecessor.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sony-xperia-l2-xa2-xa2-ultra-gadgetbyte-nepal-ces.jpg']

The phone offered AMOLED display, selfie flash and 4G connectivity, all at an affordable price. Recently, Samsung has silently enlisted the J2 Pro 2018 on their official website. The phone gets a refreshing visual overhaul which makes it homogeneous to the Samsung’s J series.  The Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro 2018 on the first glance looks like a miniature version of the now popular  J7 Pro . Unlike the J series, the phone will likely sport a plastic back with a metallic finish. The last gen featured an AMOLED display but to raise the bars even higher this year, the phone incorporates a 5inch Super AMOLED panel. The phone is powered by a quad-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz. The chipset is unspecified so my wild guess is either SD425 or Exynos 7570. Coupled with that you get 1.5GB RAM, an odd number indeed but Samsung has played this game for a while now.         J2 Pro 2018 is a 4G enabled phone and comes with dual SIM slot. The best thing is probably the dedicated microSD card slot. It’s not cool even in 2018 to have hybrids. For optics, the phone offers an 8MP rear camera with LED flash and a 5MP front-facing\xa0camera with LED flash. Android 7.0 Nougat with Samsung’s Experience UI is giving life to this phone. Like the previous variant, it’s sad to see no fingerprint sensor on this device. J2 Pro 2018 is backed by a 2600mAh battery.

This caused an outrage among the consumers. Hence as an apologetic move, Apple offered to replace batteries of iPhone 6 and other latest models at $29. For customers who can now extend their iPhone’s battery life at a low price and get better performance, it’s a win.  Barclays analysts predict that Apple’s offer to replace their flagging batteries at $29 could be problematic for sales in 2018.\xa0 There are at least 675 million iPhones in use and that 519 million are the models that require the battery replacement. This could have an immense impact\xa0on the company’s finances.         However,\xa0Barclays analyst says that thought its a good PR move. Unless the iPhone users resolve upon taking this offer instead of upgrading to a new device. Apple’s recent iPhone battery controversy and the apology could be a good PR move. However, it will hit iPhone sales, affecting around 4 percent reduction in revenue.  As\xa0Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz predicts, there are 519 million iPhones eligible for the $29 battery replacement. This would create about $1.56 billion in revenue. However, the company could get a potential loss of $10 billion from the estimated 16M iPhone sales.  Why battery replacement could affect iPhones sales.  “Even a small percentage opting for battery replacement over upgrade could have an immense impact on iPhone sales,” the Barclays analysts warn. According to him, the $29 offer incident has caused significantly higher public awareness of Apple’s behavior. As $29 is an affordable price it will provide a significant boost in speed from 600MHz to 1400MHz for an iPhone 6.\xa0Being a great opportunity, some customers may prefer battery replacing over despite the diagnostic test.  On December 20th, Apple revealed that iPhone software slows down some the devices with aging battery. Hearing this, the consumers have been very disappointed. This led the firm to face several lawsuits from customers in states, as well as customers in Israel and France. So to smooth over this issue, Apple announced that it would offer $29 iPhone battery replacements in 2018.

It was not ideal for students who are currently pursuing their study in IT as most of the companies internship would begin from 9 AM to 5 PM. However for the pass outs, career fair was a great opportunity to drop their CV for multiple companies at once.        Meetups   Noticeably there were 2 meetups in IT Meet 2018, Python Meetup and Virtual Reality Meetup. Python Meetup was all about how python enables the use of AI. Different libraries of python were showcased along with approaches one could use to get started with AI. It was a great event for anyone who wants to get started with AI.  Virtual Reality Meetup was an interesting one. Game Developers and designers from different companies showcased how to get started with creating VR contents. They showcased different technology and approaches one could use to do so. The meetup ended with the demonstration of VR and Mixed Reality games with the use of HTC Vive and the Acer Mixed Reality Headset.  Competitions   The event was filled with different competitions and I was pretty much sure a lot of people found their cup of tea.   Coding competition: Here participants had to solve mathematical and algorithmic problems with their programming language of choice. It was a true test of their programming skills.  Hackathon:  40 hours long hackathon took place where participants had to develop a product based on a certain theme or idea.  NepHack : NepHack was an interesting competition where one team would have to hack the another by exploiting the vulnerabilities.  Design Competition: Design thinking is an integral part of product development and here participants had to come up with an easy to use and interactive UI/UX.  \xa0Photography Competition: Photographs were exhibited on the walls along the stairs taken by various participants. Photographs revolved around landscapes, culture, and life. The picture that got the most votes would win the contest.  IT Quiz: IT Quiz was targeted for the +2 students where different questions related to IT. The motive of this quiz was to encourage students in the field of IT.  Gaming Competitions:\xa0 This included both mobile games and console games. Participants competed on games like Fifa 1, Dota 2, CS GO, Mini Militia.   Project Demonstration   There were a lot of project demonstration at the event. Mostly web-based technologies could be found on various booths which included Roomfinder, Birth Record Keeper, Scoreboard, and so on. Mobile-based technology included an AI-powered app that could detect a Blast disease from the photo of rice plants leaf. Another one was a blood donation app that kept active records of blood donors who can be connected with the ones in need.   Hardware Projects included a traffic control system with the use of AI, gesture-controlled wheelchair and a remote controlled vehicle with a tripod for filming some of the events.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IT-Meet-2018-Nepal-AI-Android-Python-VR-AR-Competition-Hackathon-Projects-Overview.jpg']
['Best Health and Fitness Apps for Healthy Lifestyle'],"['Apps', 'Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['January 9, 2018']",2018-01-08 19:52:46+00:00,"['We generally understand healthy as the state of being well. And having a good health is inarguably the greatest wealth any living being could possess. However, many factors come along the way to diminish the health\xa0condition of people. But with a mere conscience, a little bit of the precautions and with few healthy habits, any individual can preserve their state of well-being for a long time. And here are some free health and fitness apps that can help an individual to be healthy for an extended period of time.  BMI calculator  BMI calculator specializes in calculating the BMI and BMR. The acronym BMI stands for Body Mass Index, the value of which is derived with the help of the weight and height of an individual. And this index is used to identify the condition of the well-being of an individual in terms of weight. The BMI Calculator app takes note of the age, sex, height and weight of a person, calculates the BMI and deduces the weight condition of the person viz. normal, underweight, overweight, and obese.  On the other hand, BMR stands for Basal Metabolic rate, which means the number of calories a healthy person burns at rest. These calories are burned for the naturally basic tasks like breathing, digesting, keeping the heart beating and all the other physiological tasks keeping a human alive. Alike the calculation of the BMI, the app demands the age, sex, height, and weight of a person and presents the BMR. With these data, one can take the required actions to bring their body weight to the normal state and get a step closer to a healthy lifestyle.        There are many BMI calculator app in the App store and Play store. The main focus here is only to check the BMI and BMR value. So any trustworthy app can be used for the purpose.  Calculate the BMI here in this link.  Google Fit   While walking, jogging or running, it is difficult to track the amount of calories burnt. And without the actual data, the journey to the fitness sometimes deviates from the way planned. Under such scenario, the use of Google Fit proves to be helpful.  Google Fit app primarily requires Gmail account to get logged into the app. The app then counts the number of footsteps during the exercise and deduces the amount of calories burnt. Users can also set the goals in terms of steps after planning the amount of calories to burn on any given day. The app also tracks the activities as the exercise like walking or jogging, running, cycling, etc. To see the distance traveled or the actual amount of calories burnt during the exercise, filling out the weight, height, and gender at the beginning is mandatory.  Accuracy may bother its users quite often. So to help the Google Fit to track actual calories burned in the process, after turning the GPS on, users need to press the ‘+’ button in the app, click the ‘start activity’ option and then mention the type of activity before proceeding to the exercise. And for the most accurate calibration during the activities, it is better to keep the smartphone in the pocket or in the backpack (if any).  The activities along with the amount of calories burnt in the process are saved by the device. These values can be accessed later and a general overview of the exercise pattern can be known.  Water Drink Reminder   The role of water in the human body is indispensable. The human body needs to be hydrated timely for the fluent operation of the metabolism. However, because of the busyness due to the chores, people often forget to refill the body with water. And such habits drive the body towards fatigue, muscle cramps, spasms, dizziness, headache, constipation, increased anxiety, etc. And the persistence in the dehydration invites horrific diseases like chronic fatigue and depression, migraine, arthritis, stomach ulcers, kidney stones, etc. To avoid such aggressions, Water Drink Reminder app was conceived.  The app asks for body weight, sleeping time and time to wake up. Accounting the body weight, amount of water required for a human body is determined. And with the sleeping and waking up time, working time is deduced. The app then reminds the user with an alarm precisely every hour during the working time. The users can set the amount of water drunk on every reminder and reduce the daily goal. If the quality of water meets the prescribed value, the app notifies the user about the reached goal. The app hence will not buzz the user for rest of the day.  Twilight   In this tech-savvy world, our exposure to the blue light is increasing more than ever. The use of digital devices like smartphones and computers, watching TVs and playing gaming consoles has increased at an unprecedented rate. These habits are increasing our exposure to the blue lights and pushing towards an unhealthy ecosystem.  Also Read: \xa0 What’s the blue light from the display doing to you?  Sun is the natural source of blue light. Exposure to the natural form of blue light regulates the natural sleep and wake cycles and this process is known as Circadian Rhythm. In addition to the regulation of Circadian Rhythm, the natural blue light increases the alertness, heightens reaction times, damps the mood swings and improves the state of well-being. However, the exposure to the artificial blue lights is unhealthy to the human body. Exposure to the artificial blue light contributes to eyestrain, retinal damage and ultimately leading to the macular degeneration. Researchers have proved that the blue light also disrupts the state of hormones in the body. Furthermore, the blue light can trigger cancers, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. To defend such horrific diseases, Twilight app was developed. This app filters the harmful blue light oozing from the smartphones and saves the eyes.  The app basically has three modes to adjust the blue light filter. The first way is by controlling the color temperature, which can be adjusted at a value between 1000K to 5000K with an interval of 500K in between. \xa0Keeping the temperature to lower values is good for eyes, they sooth the eyes and prevent eyestrains. However, lower color temperatures invite the reddish tint in the screen. On the other hand, higher color temperatures bring blue tint on the screen. Setting the color temperature to high values induce eyestrains and cause sleep disorders.  Other additional two modes of the app are intensity and screen dim. As the name implies, the intensity controls the amount of reddish or bluish tint on the screen and the screen dim mode allows the user to adjust the brightness. There are also numerous ways to automatically toggle the blue light filter on and off in the app. According to the user choice, the blue light filter can be activated always, during the user-preset time or between the sunset and sunrise time.  Some smartphone comes with pre-built Blue light filter app or possesses modes like Night display mode or Reading mode. If these features are inbuilt in the smartphone, Blue-rays through the smartphone displays is zero or minimal when activated and the Twilight app is not required.  Sleep Bot   Inadequate sleep is often proclaimed as a slow poison. It greatly pulverizes the physical and mental state of well-being. Sleep deprivation causes diminish in memory, emotional outburst, paranoia, chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, strokes, etc. So a good amount of sleep is highly essential to a human body. And Sleep Bot app is a qualified tool for sleep tracking and to drive its users to a healthier lifestyle.  The user needs to set the app to “Going to sleep” mode before going to bed. The app also asks to check smart alarm, track motion and record sound mode before the sleep. The smart alarm mode awakes the user somewhere in between thirty minutes prior to set time to set time judging the best time to wake the user. Similarly, track motion option tracks the movement of the smartphone during the sleep. If the smartphone is kept close to the user, the app can trace the motion of the user and any discomforts during the sleep or somnambulism can be realized.  There is also the record sound option, which records sound during the sleep. This mode helps to keep track of difficulties during the sleep like uncomfortable breathing, snoring, and the somniloquence. In addition to the sleep tracking, there is education material regarding the sleep, healthy ways to induce sleep, ways to stay awake, etc.  Headspace   To be healthy, an individual should possess not only a fit body but also a sound mind. In the surrounding full of turmoils and emotional distraughtness hitting frequently, no person can escape the depression. Such mental stresses develop inhumane behaviors in people and also encourages the social crimes. So having a calm mind free of tensions is another important to have to be healthy.  Headspace app is basically the mindfulness app offering a guided meditation. The app requires registration in the beginning, which can be done using email or with Facebook ID. After the registration, the users can always head to Audio or Visual mode to calm their mind. It contains numerous audio speech and animations to tranquil and cheer\xa0its users.  Headspace contains numerous categories Heath, Brave, Happiness, Work & Performance, Students, Sports, etc. If the stresses are related to any of the aforementioned categories, one can always go through the sessions and relax their mind. However, Headspace requires connection to download the speeches and animations prior to the session. And this can be frustrating to the people, who lack the reach of Wi-Fi or cheap mobile internet.  For the ones, who lose the track of time and are prone to miss the meditation session, there is also a reminder mode, which beeps at the preset time.  Pokemon Go   Scheduling every day for workout and exercises is pretty daunting. And even more awful is to do it. To defy such mindsets, Pokemon Go game was developed, which discourages passivity and obesity by luring people into exercises\xa0playfully.  The game primarily is a treasure-hunting app with the characters in the scenario based on the popular anime Pokemon. The app emulates an augmented reality world with map and Pokemon characters in it. The main focus of the users will be to reach different Poke Stops and hunt different Pokemon. \xa0On catching every Pokemon, users are rewarded and that is what keeps the player going. Pokemon are scattered in different locations, so get rewarded in the game user motion is essential. The app uses pedometer and GPS to track the motion of the user.  Since the app essential requires connection to the server and movement is crucial in the game, users need to turn on their mobile data connection, which will not be feasible if the tariffs are higher.  Hamro Doctor   Prevention is definitely better than cure. But since the life is full of uncertainties and sickness and accidents happens without a prior notice. So to suppress the damages in such scenarios, consulting Hamro Doctor App proves to be helpful.  The app is divided into different sections like Hospital, Doctor, Blood Donor, Ambulance, and Medicine. As the name implies, the hospital section contains the information related to the hospitals. The app encapsulates numerous hospitals of Nepal with their location, contact number, number of beds in general, ICU and Emergency wards. The hospital section also contains the name of the doctors working in the hospital with their designated specialty. The information of the doctors can also be obtained in the Doctors section, where the name of the doctors is sorted in alphabetical order.  Likewise, in the Blood Donor section, there is a collective database of the blood donors with their name, contact number, district, and blood group. There is also a filter option on the top, where the user can select the blood group required and location of the donor. In addition to requesting blood from the donor, one can also place their interest for the donation by filling name, phone number, address, blood group and date of the last donation. Similarly, the Ambulance sections contain number and address of the ambulance, which can be summoned during emergencies. And the Medicine section prescribes medicines with dosages for different kind of illnesses.

This is help to make the price competitive in the almost saturated smartphone market of Nepal. The Colors S11 is a device that will be targeted towards the selfie lovers as we have news that it will house dual front-facing lenses up top.  If the speculations circulating around are considered, the Colors S11 will be a fairly priced budget smartphone that will come with the price range of Rs. 12,000 – Rs. 14,000. It will most probably sport an HD display in a frame of 5.2-inch. The Colors S11 could also be one of the devices in its price range to come with 3 GB RAM.

['Micromax and Google Partnered to make a $32 Smartphone'],"['Android', 'Micromax']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 7, 2018']",2018-01-07 16:16:06+00:00,"['Android phones have gotten affordable than ever. You can get 4G enabled phones for as cheap as $100. But that was last year, Welcome to 2018, where smartphones are about to get cheaper than ever! On 26th January, Micromax in partnership with Google is set to launch the very first of Android Go smartphones in India. This phone will be priced at $32 which is close to around INR.2000 or NRs.3,200. At this point, it is almost unbelievable to imagine a phone for three thousand as all we can get is basic bar phones for that price. Apart from knowing that it’ll have a touchscreen and runs on Android Go  (Lite version of Android Oreo) , other specifications are still unknown.  Other Indian smartphone manufacturers are also on the same track but haven’t given a clear date for the launch of their products. Followed by Micromax, companies like Intex, Lava, Karbonn, and others are launching their own Android Go smartphones at a similar price point. So now we will have an extra category apart from budget, namely, Super Budget phones. Initializing with the Indian market, Google is aiming into other markets in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia and Latin America.         The current number of active Android users is over two billion. And so, Google wants to expand\xa0that to another billion by focusing those with a low budget.\xa0 Half of the feature phones that the manufacturers sell in India are all below the $32 mark. The Go phones, however, will have the advantage of a true and pure Google experience. And being the first manufacturer Micromax may have its upper hand on the market than other following companies.  So, this project is great for those consumers who switch to Chinese brands in search for low priced android phones with good specifications.  So what is Android Go?   Android Go is the lite version of Android Oreo which will run on lesser hardware. It will run on devices with RAM as low as 512MB-1GB and devices with 8GB of storage. The inbuilt apps will consume less storage because of the optimised apps such as Google Go, Youtube Go, etc. These slimmed down apps use low space and give maximum performance even on low RAM. Nevertheless, it will retain the same taste and feel just like the original Androids. The phones will contain Qualcomm and MediaTek processor chip inside for the best performance. Android Go contains a built-in data manager which will help the user save and control more data.  “ These phones get all the optimizations that come with Android Oreo (Go edition), including a better performing OS with built-in data management features and security benefits.   There is also a new set of pre-installed Google apps, including Google Go and the Google Assistant for Android Oreo (Go edition), designed to be lighter and more relevant to the unique needs of the next billion users ” Caesar Sengupta, VP, Next Billion Users team at Google had said in a blog post.   Android Oreo (Go edition) smartphones also come with a version of the Google Play Store that allows people to download an app highlighting the apps designed to work best on Go edition devices. Despite that, in the end, user’s will prefer the Android experience that has fewer data cap overages and seamlessly cause fewer performance hiccups. And it may improve since there is still a stigma around using phones with less memory.']",[]

Recently, the security researchers at Google project zero along with some academy and industry researchers have detected and reported a ‘serious flaw’ which can put the confidential information at serious risk . What are these flaws prominent in? Do these affect our PCs? how do they exploit our gadgets? Whether or not can they be detected? How do we mitigate the harm?  This article deals with all these questions in everybody’s minds for keeping us informed of such threats to our gadgets.  There are not one but two bugs producing the threat to our device’s security and the information in them. They are namely  M eltdown and Spectre .  Meltdown  affects the hardware by breaking the isolation that exists between the user application and operating system. The bug melts the security between an operating system and user application. According to Google, “Almost every Intel  processor  since 1995 has been affected by meltdown”. Referred as CVE-2017-5754.        Spectre  breaks the meltdown between user applications. It is also being taken as the hardware vulnerability referred by CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715.  Meltdown can be found in the device with the chip from Intel whereas Spectre can be found in the device having the chip from  Intel ,  AMD,  and  ARM . Despite that, both of these make it easy for the cyber-criminals to have access to the passwords and the device memory. However, AMD claims that its chips are not vulnerable.  The probability that these flaws are already present in our devices is high. No operating system right from IOS, windows, LINUX etc. is free from these flaws. But, it’s almost impossible for us to detect whether or not our devices are affected by Meltdown and Spectre as the devices run as they have been running and we can find out no fault.  Not even the anti-viruses can detect the threat as they are quite difficult to detect compared to normal malware. But the antiviruses can detect the malware using such attacks by comparing the binaries.  How to fix the harm for different OS?  Google  has come up with some patches. Google has issued a  security  fix for these  Whereas  Microsoft  has come up with the patch for windows 10 to be downloaded automatically and for the older operating systems, the patch will soon be available.  Even though  Apple  has made no public comment as such but one of the researchers suggests macOS 10.13.2 for the Apple devices.  \xa0LINUX  system has a patch as well but they reportedly slow down the devices. They have issued Kernel patches for dealing with this issue.  Amazon web service has also been patched for Google cloud platform, Amazon web services, and Microsoft Azure. The chrome books have received security from OS63.  If the patches are not available for the devices, we are to checkout with the operating system provider and the device maker then install them as soon as possible for mitigating the harm. Either being caused or to be caused by Meltdown and Spectre.  Highlights   Two different flaws i.e. Spectre and Meltdown  Meltdown found in Intel processors.  Spectre found in devices having Intel, ARM and AMD chips.  Invading of the security barrier to access secret information.  Cannot be easily detected by antivirus.

['UMIDIGI Crystal Review: The bezel-less beauty with a few hiccups!'],"['Reviews', 'UMIDIGI']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['January 6, 2018']",2018-01-06 06:38:25+00:00,"['UMIDIGI  has produced quite a few phones over time. One of its recent arrivals in the Nepali market is the UMIDIGI Crystal that has been offered at a budget price of Rs, 25,900. The device is one of those smartphones that offers a near bezelless display and 4GB RAM along with 64 GB storage at a low price. The other specifications too look very impressive on paper. Let’s not get carried away by the specifications. What the phone’s performance, in reality, is like? Here is a full review of the UMIDIGI Crystal to help you answer the question.   Also Read:   UMIDIGI Mobiles Price in Nepal        UMIDIGI Crystal Specifications:   5.5-inch 1080 x 1920 pixels full HD Bezel-less SHARP 2.5D curved display  Corning Gorilla Glass 4  1.5GHz Octa-core MediaTek MT6750T processor  4GB RAM, 64GB internal memory, expandable with microSD upto 256GB  Android v7.0 (Nougat)  13 MP + 5 MP dual rear cameras with\xa0Samsung sensor  5 MP front camera  Dual Hybrid SIM (Nano+Nano/TF Card) with 4G LTE  USB Type-C  Rear-mounted fingerprint sensor  3000 mAh non-removable battery  Glass Body (2.5D curved glass on the front & rear)   Display and Design   Let’s go for the design and display first. I must say that the phone looks very premium for the price. The 18:9 aspect ratio surely does not go out of notice! There is glass everywhere, on the front and even on the back, which is, surrounded by a metallic frame. Apart from the metallic portion, the entire thing is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The only complaint I have with the glass is that it attracts a lot of smudges, as you can see for yourself; my prints are all over the phone. But in terms of scratch protection, it does well.  Moving on, the phone has a 5.5- inch 1080p display which is very sharp and bright. It has a good color reproduction meaning the colors are nice and vibrant and the level of contrast it provides is good too. The display is visible under sunlight too and I must say there are no viewing angle problems on this device. The UMIDIGI Crystal does well in the display department.   On the top, we have the 3.5mm audio jack and the proximity and light sensors and just below it, we have a small speaker. Similarly, on the bottom, we have the USB port and two speakers. On the right, we have the SIM/memory card slot and on the left, there are the volume control buttons and the power button. What I have always wanted to say out loud is, the UMIDIGI Crystal has the worst power button placement in the world. I mean, each time, I had to struggle to find it. And mind you, I used this device for more than 2 weeks and I still have the same concern. Well, you can imagine the magnitude of the problem!!  The notification light on the lower side looks cool. Though the looks are elegant, the phone is one awkward device to hold. I think it’s probably because of the edges being too pointed and the phone being a bit thick. Thereby, in the design portion, the phone could have done better rather than only focusing on minimizing the bezels!  Performance  Second, let’s dive into how the device performs. The UMIDIGI Crystal is powered by an octa-core MediaTek6750T processor coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64 GB of onboard storage expandable up to 256 GB. Out of the 64GB storage, we have 54 GB left for usage, which is okay! App switching on this device is fine; however, app opening is a little slower in comparison to other phones. It’s like the phone panics while we try to open any app in a rush. The phone is not as responsive as it should be. However, the phone can handle many apps at the same time. On my use, the phone has never shut off while aggressively using different apps.   Gaming on this device is a good experience. I have played high end to lower end games and the results are pretty good. No stutters while playing any games and the visuals look good as well. So, no complaints! The only thing that bothered me while playing games is that the speakers tend to be covered while holding the phone with both hands and I could not feel the trill while playing Asphalt 8 and Hakku run. Other than that, gaming is smooth. And yes, long time gaming equals to the device heating up as fire.  The UMIDIGI Crystal comes with Android 7.0 Nougat coupled with a near stock like UI. So, you are not going to find bloatware on board. The UI has some additional features like, customizing the notification bar, changing the position of navigation keys, etc. There is also a guest mode for the ones preferring to use it. Overall, the UI is simple and nothing to whine about.   The GPS tracker is not, however, very accurate. It tends to lose your location time and often. While I am still complaining about the performance, wifi connectivity, in the UMIDIGI Crystal, though it’s dual-band, it’s not good. I mean it loses the signal often if you are not near your router. This is very frustrating.  Moving on, let’s talk about the sound quality. The speakers are loud but it lacks any kind of bass and the sound quality is just average. The fingerprint sensor is at the back and slightly slow in performance, it’s not too bad but it’s not fast as well. Also, it’s like the fingerprint sensor is mixed with the back, so it’s difficult finding it.  Summing up, apart from the gaming and UI experience, the performance is just okay!  Camera   Let’s move on to the cameras. The UMIDIGI Crystal has a 13+5 MP dual camera setup at the rear portion and a 5 MP selfie shooter at the front. The rear camera is one of those that has a fake Bokeh as it is crystal clear that it is the software that is producing the blur.      Normal Mode     Bokeh Mode   The Bokeh is terrible, as you can see in the pictures; it creates a blur only in a circular fashion, bringing together both the object in focus as well as the surroundings.      Normal Mode     Bokeh Mode   I didn’t have the hassle of testing the HDR mode in this device because there isn’t such feature! There is an option to save the raw photo which was quite a waste considering there are minimum camera features.  \xa0             The images from the rear camera come out average. The images are not so sharp and oftentimes come out overexposed. Similarly, when I zoomed into the camera and took pictures, I was disappointed with the quality. With a dual camera setup, I was expecting more!          Similarly, the 5 MP selfie shooter is not very impressive either. The pictures in broad daylight are mediocre in quality and in dark lighting conditions; the images are dark, blurry and grainy. Also, there was a reddish tint in the pictures that didn’t look good. One major concern with the selfie camera is its placement! In an attempt to have minimum bezels at the top, the selfie camera is placed at the bottom of the phone, which is very awkward indeed. Once you open the camera, you cannot figure out where to look. And every time you have to invert your phone to take selfies, which is a hassle I didn’t like taking.  Battery   Talking about the battery, The UMIDIGI Crystal is powered by a 3000 mAh battery. Under normal usage that is for phone calls and using social media the phone’s battery lasts for almost a day. Whereas, while playing games and watching videos, the phone suffers significant battery drainage as a result of which, the battery lasts for around 5 hours. Similarly, the device takes around 2 and a half hour to get fully charged meaning there is no fast charging support and gives a screen-\xa0on time of 3 hours. There is a battery saving mode but that does not cover up the average performance of the battery. The only thing that is good about the battery is that the USB is type-C.  Conclusion   In conclusion, the UMIDIGI Crystal did not perform as well as I expected. Yes, the device gives a beautiful near bezelless display at a budget price, but the display is not the only thing in a smartphone. At least with a stock like android, I would expect a better battery life. Latency in app opening is frustrating and even though the UI is simple, the performance is just par. The fake Bokeh adds up to the\xa0not so good camera performance. Except for the gaming and the display, purchasing this phone means making a lot of sacrifices. Overall, I think the UMIDIGI Crystal is just crystal by name; it’s not a gem in reality! So, I would recommend you invest some more and get something better.      Pros  Cons    Good Display and bezel-less design  Average cameras    Gorilla Glass protection  Inconvenient button placements    Good gaming performance  Below-average battery life']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/UMi-Crystal-feature1.jpg']
['Nokia 6 (2018) launched with refreshed design and remarkable specs'],['Nokia'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['January 5, 2018']",2018-01-05 10:55:07+00:00,"['After the revival by the HMD Global, Nokia has been back on the track in the successful smartphone business. The craze of people for the new Nokia phones reminds us about the old days. And numbers are the proof as the  Nokia smartphones have been sold out in minutes  on more than one occasions. And among the bunch of smartphones in their lineup, Nokia 6 was comparatively loved more than the rest. So, to fuel that love, Nokia has brought a refreshed version of the Nokia 6 dubbed as Nokia 6 (2018). And the most interesting thing on the newbie is, despite the refreshed looks and improved specs, the Nokia 6 2018 comes at a similar price to its predecessor.  Also Read:  Nokia Mobiles Price in Nepal  Nokia 6 2018 comes with the aluminum body presenting the same sturdy vibe alike its predecessor. Also, the device possesses the same 5.5-inch display cloaked by the Gorilla glass 3 for the protection. Despite the trend of  bezel-less display  and 18:9 aspect ratio, the newbie has been persistent with the traditional 16:9 ratio and thick bezel boundaries. However, a small portion of bezels has been chopped off in the Nokia 6 2018 and the screen-to-body ratio improved to 73.2% from 70.7%. And the reduced bezels are to be blamed for the shifting of fingerprint sensor from home button at the front to the back. Also, the capacitive buttons are replaced by the on-screen buttons in this newbie.        Nokia has made a good choice of the chipset in this device. The upgrade from the Snapdragon 430 chipset to Snapdragon 630 is simply exemplary. Also, the presence of Adreno 508 GPU in the device will drive the device swiftly even while performing the graphics-intensive tasks. On the storage side, Nokia 6 (2018) is gifted with 4GB of RAM offering two choices in terms of internal storages viz. 32GB and 64GB. However, the absence of the dedicated slot is quite displeasing here, as one has to sacrifice the second SIM slot to allocate space for SDcard.  On the software front, Nokia 6 2018 comes with a stock version of Android Nougat out of the box. But no worries, the device has been promised with the Oreo update. These days, even the mid-range and budget smartphones come with a  dual-camera setup . That is not the case here. It embraces a 16MP camera on the back, which comes with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus and dual-tone LED flash. Up front, there is an 8MP camera with f/2.0 aperture but lacking the LED flash.  On the connectivity side, Nokia 6 2018 is quite bold with Bluetooth 5.0, Radio, NFC, Wi-Fi 1/b/g/n, A-GPS and USB Type-C. As mentioned earlier, the smartphone possesses the fingerprint sensor, which resides on the back. The device has also embraced other primary sensors like accelerometer, gyro, proximity and compass sensors. To juice up the device, there is 3000mAh battery equipped with the device, which also supports the fast charging. Fueling the device at the pace of fast charging get the battery refilled to 50% in mere 30 minutes.  The device comes in two color variants viz. Black and Silver. Nokia started taking the pre-orders for the device and the sale will commence from the January 10 in China. In terms of price, Nokia 6 2018 demands 1499 Yuan (US$ 230 approx.) for the 32GB storage version, whereas its 64GB counterpart demands 1699 Yuan (US$ 262 approx.).  Launch, Availability of Nokia 6 2018 in Nepal  There was no mention of rolling out the devices in the global market during the official announcement of the device. However, on the talk with Nokia Nepal officials, we were informed that the device would make an entrance in Nepal sometime in the March. And during the talk, the officials confidently stated that the pricing will be close to the international pricing.  Nokia 6 2018 Vs.

['Oops and Wows in Smartphone Technology (2017 Edition)'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['January 4, 2018']",2018-01-04 13:11:53+00:00,"['We already bid farewell to the year 2017. However, the year had brought some cheerful and some disappointing innovations in the smartphone system, which cannot be ignored or forgotten simply. So, in this article, we have tried to recollect such oops and wows in smartphone technology, which affected the smartphone community and had been the talk of the town throughout the year. Let’s get started.  Wows of 2017  Bezel-less display  Xiaomi MI Mix , the smartphone, which came as an  edgeless concept phone  last year lacked bezels on three\xa0of its sides. On that phone, the bezels were located only at the bottom to house the front camera and proximity sensor. Later, LG conducted a survey to know the display size and smartphone size preferred by the smartphone users. The survey concluded that the users loved to have a big display without a corresponding increase in the smartphone size. The only way to meet such demand was to ditch the bezels and LG applied that formula on  LG G6 . The smartphone embraced univisium display with 18:9 aspect ratio and 78.6% screen-to-body ratio.  Samsung  appreciated the concept of  bezel-less display  and applied the formula on  Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ . However, a little bit uniqueness on Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ was a weird and unfamiliar 18.5:9 aspect ratio.        Since then a large number of smartphone manufacturers implemented the concept and even made the 18:9 aspect ratio trendy. The  Samsung Galaxy Note 8 ,  Samsung Galaxy S8  and S8+ comes with 18.5:9 aspect ratio and  iPhone X  with 19.5:9. Except for these smartphones, all the bezel-less smartphones come with 18:9 aspect ratio.  Also Read:  Smartphones with bezel-less display in Nepal  Cameras getting better  Since the beginning, the cameras on smartphones are getting better in every iteration. And in this year too, the trend continued. \xa0Coming towards the end of the year 2016, different manufacturers had adopted the  concept of the dual camera . And this year the concept grew like a wildfire in the smartphone community. From the budget smartphones to the flagship ones, all (almost) smartphone brands had been touched by the concept of dual cameras. And almost all smartphone manufacturers brought at least one smartphone of such type in their lineup.  Huawei stuck to the idea and brought some fancy smartphones with top-notch cameras like  Huawei P10 Plus ,  Honor V10 ,  Mate 10 Series ,  Honor 9 , etc. this year. The dual camera setup on the high-end Huawei devices is the combination of Monochrome and RGB sensor. And Leica is the collaborated vendor for supplying the required optical products. However, in the mid-range section, there is a different story. The mid-tier smartphones lack the optics from the Leica and the lenses used is basically for the depth sensing and to deliver Bokeh effect. Still, Huawei seems to satisfy its customers as it gained the  second position in the sales beating its archrival Apple . And Nepali customers might also fall among the happy ones as Huawei brought  Huawei Nova 2i , the first smartphone in Nepal with four cameras.  iPhone brought  iPhone X ,  iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  this year. Apple gained a lot of applause this year for the innovations brought in the tech world and for the specs packed in its devices. And one of the reasons for the appraisal is its camera. iPhone X, the anniversary edition iPhone score an astounding 97 score on the reputed camera benchmark, DxOmark. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are not much far behind. iPhone 8 possesses DxoMark benchmark score of 92, whereas the iPhone 8 Plus has 94.  Samsung Galaxy Note 8  had been persistent all along with the single camera setup. Even on the  Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ , Samsung hesitated to include an additional camera. Probably Apple could be the motivation here, but Samsung finally stepped-up to include a dual camera on its smartphone and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 had been the first and lucky one. And probably, the dual camera is to be credited for the increase in DxoMark score from 88 (in S8) to 94 (in Note 8).  Despite the endeavors of smartphone manufacturers to provide a dual camera to mimic the shots of DSLRs and to produce Bokeh effect, the smartphones have failed in one or more scenario. However, just with a mere presence of a single camera,  Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL  produced Bokeh shots with a close resemblance (than others) to that of DSLRs. And outperforming all the flagship smartphones of 2017,  Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL  scored the highest DxOmark score (for smartphones’ camera) of 98.  New security options  This year, new security options were seen on the smartphones. Iris scanner on Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+ and Note 8 was absolutely remarkable. The technology was developed by Samsung earlier and had incorporated it on the  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 . However, because of the  exploding issues of the Note 7 , the smartphone discontinued and the tech community was not quite able to experience the new biometric security.  Every person has unique patterns in the irises and such patterns are virtually impossible to replicate. This uniqueness has made the iris authentication one of the safest ways to keep the phone locked and the contents invulnerable.  Also Read:  Hackers tricked Samsung Galaxy S8’s Iris Scanner  Apple also brought the new security option on the  iPhone X . Namely known as FaceID, the technology uses a combination of the infrared emitter and TrueDepth sensor to mask 30,000 points of infrared light on and around the face. After the masking process, it generates flat infrared snapshots like the photos (2D).While registering the face; the depth sensor measures the depth on the face accounting the reflection of infrared light on each point and hence constructs a depth map of the face. On the launch ceremony, CEO of the Apple boasted that the technology is extremely secure. Putting forward as the proof Apple’s CEO mentioned that the odds to unlock a smartphone with someone else’s fingerprint is 1in 50,000, however, similar chances of unlocking the iPhone X with other’s face is 1 in 1,000,000.  Also Read:  iPhone X facial recognition shows mixed results in identifying twins  Nokia and Blackberry Revival  Company of the Nokia with Microsoft was not quite fruitful. Before the acquisition by Microsoft, Nokia was the most popular and most selling mobile brand. However, with the emergence of iOS and Android platform and with the decision of the Nokia phones to adopt Windows OS ecosystem, the market share of Nokia mobiles fell at an unprecedented rate. With the downfall getting intolerable, Nokia freed itself from the clutches of Nokia and  collaborated with HMD Global  to bring Android smartphones. And in MWC 2017, Nokia announced its revival in the smartphone market launching  Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 smartphones  as the proof. And the comeback was a pretty exhilarating one because the  new Nokia smartphones sold out in minutes  on more than one occasion.  Blackberry smartphones were renowned for their iconic keypad and remarkable security. But as the Android and iOS smartphones marked their presence in the smartphone arena, the hunger for the Blackberry smartphones amongst the people simply started to fade away. And later, the sales and shares climbed a downhill. A little later, Blackberry ditched their home-baked BB10 OS and brought an Android smartphone but keeping the iconic keypad intact. The smartphone was dubbed as Blackberry Priv, which had a sliding QWERTY keyboard, remarkable 5.4-inch AMOLED display featuring Quad-HD resolution and 18MP rear camera with OIS. However, in the tech society lured with the screen-touch smartphones, the smartphone was unable to gain the customers. With all the endeavors turning futile, Blackberry decided to quit the smartphone manufacture business. In the October 2016,  Blackberry officially announced to discontinue making smartphones by itself .  However, with this remark, Blackberry has not been lost in the oblivion. Blackberry is now just the licensing partner while TCL is now manufacturing the Blackberry smartphones. TCL is keeping the name of the Blackberry alive and taking credits for launching the Blackberry smartphones. Till the date, TCL has launched three Blackberry smartphones, namely  Blackberry Mercury ,  Blackberry KeyOne , and  Blackberry Motion . And how will the TCL go with the Blackberry, there is more yet to be\xa0seen.  Growth of AI Assistants  Since 2011, iPhones always seem to be upper hand over the Android smartphones because of Siri, the AI assistant. However, in 2017, many AI assistants were released. In 2017,  Google Assistant  got better and the most interesting thing is Google brought the Google Assistant app for the iOS posing an open threat to the Siri. Samsung also brought a new AI assistant named Bixby. Amazon’s Alexa and HTC’s home-baked AI HTC Sense Companion were also quite heard in 2017. However,  Samsung’s Bixby , Amazon Alexa and HTC Sense companion were barely comparable to the Google Assistant and the Siri during the time being. But how they will perform in 2018, there is more yet to see.  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Capability of the Chipsets  Apple brought the new A11 chipset in the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Fabricated using 10nm technology, the chipset packs 4.3 billion transistors and has embraced six cores CPU and three core GPU. However, the exciting addition to the chipset is Neural Engine, which can perform up to 600 billion operations per seconds. Apple claims that the Neural Engine is used for FaceID, Animojis, and Machine learning tasks. Similarly, improving the AI capabilities, Qualcomm released  Snapdragon 845 with the visual processing unit  and Huawei released the Kirin 970 with the Neural processing unit. The chipset seems to be exceptionally superior, however, to get the closer glimpse of the AI capabilities of the chipsets, in-depth review of the smartphones equipped with aforementioned chipsets is highly essential.

Razer had been providing superior and reliable gaming performance in its  laptops  and  Ultrabooks  all along. However, in 2017, Razer expanded its horizon stepping its feet in the smartphone arena. Dubbed as  Razer Phone , the smartphone comes with some nifty set of hardware with gaming touch by the Razer. The most exciting touch by the maker is the astounding 120Hz refresh rate on its display. Razer has named it a UltraMotion display and Razer Phone is the first smartphone to be equipped with such fast refresh rate. With such high refresh rate, one can enjoy smooth graphics on the use. The UltraMotion display also has an adaptive refresh technology that synchronizes the GPU and display, which removes image tearing or lag.  Also Read:  Is 120Hz Refresh Rate on display the future of Smartphone?  Oops of 2017  Struggle of the fingerprint sensors  Fingerprint recognition is the biometric security means and is more reliable to the pin, password and pattern recognition. In 2017, this security means was widely adopted in the smartphones. It was difficult to find smartphones without fingerprint sensor even on the lower-midrange and budget segments. However, some big names had been notorious throughout 2017 because of the way they treated the fingerprint sensor in their premium handsets.  Samsung had been persistent on keeping the sensor in the home button of their smartphones. However, in Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+, and Note 8, the bezels were minimized making it impossible to fit the sensor on the chin. Shifting the sensor to the back was the alternative left and Samsung embraced the alternative without a second thought. The fingerprint sensors provided on the smartphones were sensitive and unlocking the devices was abrupt. However, the placement was not quite accessible to the hands on the use. Despite the alluring symmetry, because of the awkward placement, one would always end up smudging the camera placed in the proximity.  The archrival to the Samsung, the Apple had also been talk of the town because of the fingerprint sensor. But unlike the Samsung flagships, Apple completely uprooted the sensor from its anniversary edition iPhone, the iPhone X. Adopting the trendy bezel-less display and because of its resistant to shift the sensor to the back, iPhone X was obliged to bid farewell its infamous TouchID.  Death of Windows Phones  With Cortana AI assistant and Windows OS in the system, Windows Phones looked cool and lucrative. However, with the Android and iOS devices rising in the tech community, the craze of the Windows Phones fell at an exponential rate. Because of the increased functionalities and appealing hardware and software capabilities of the iOS and Android devices, Windows Phones suffocated in the smartphone market. And in 2017, Microsoft’s Joe Belfiore officially announced the  death of the Windows Phones . Despite the announced death, Microsoft promised to continue the support for the platform, bug fixes, security updates, etc. However, they will completely halt the production of new features and hardware and will bring nothing new to the Windows Phones.

We can finally confirm that this device will launch here in a week.  Don’t Miss:   Xiaomi Mobiles Price in Nepal  Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is a bezel-less device with an 18:9 aspect ratio. It has a 5.99-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1080 x 2160 pixels. This display is cloaked by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for that extra protection. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 basically has the specifications a proper flagship of 2017 comes with. So, it’s rocking an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor under the hood. 6 or 8 GB of RAM pair up with Adreno 540 GPU to go alongside the processor. Only the special edition unibody ceramic design houses 8 GB of RAM on the inside. All other variants have 6 GB of RAM. The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 offers consumers 64 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB storage variants.         As far as the optics are concerned, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 has a single 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture, dual tone LED flash and OIS. At a time when even a smartphone under Rs. 10,000 has dual real cameras, Xiaomi’s choice to opt for a single lens might turn off some buyers here in Nepal. The front-facing selfie shooter has a 5-megapixel lens with f/2.0 aperture.  The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 runs on Android v7.1 Nougat with MIUI 9 on the top right out of the box. Xiaomi has already provided its users with the BETA version of Android v8.0 Oreo.  In terms of power, the Mi Mix 2 is supported by a 3,400 mAh Li-Ion battery.

['Samsung Nepal set to launch Galaxy A8 and A8 Plus (2018)'],"['Android', 'Samsung']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 3, 2018']",2018-01-03 12:31:20+00:00,"['Not many days since 2018 has started and  Samsung  is all set to launch two mobile phones in the galaxy series i.e. Galaxy A8 and A8 plus. The phones are expected to release in the third week of January. Smartphones of the A-series are always premium but compromise on the performance front. Over the years, they have always featured some top of the line specifications all while compromising with the performance.  Also Read:  Samsung Mobiles Price in Nepal  With not many days before the launch, let’s get into the what and why’s of the phones. As the model of the phones themselves signify, these phones are similar to a great extent but with slightest of dissimilarities.        The glass front and back with aluminum body makes it a trendy phone as glass is being preferred these days. On the weight department, the A8 and A8 Plus have 172 and 191 grams of weight respectively. The A8 Plus has a taller screen i.e. 6 inches for the people who like big screens. The phones are IP68 certified which means these are dust and water resistant for 30 minutes and 1.5 meters which is an advancement.  Starting with the display, the phones have Super AMOLED display which means sharper blacks and saving of battery to a great extent which, we can barely find in phones like this as of 2017. As per the size of the screen is concerned, the phones have 18.5:9 ratio which is really good. On top of that, the phones have Corning Gorilla Glass which is again great to have on a phone.   The phones run on Android 7.1.1 Nougat version which is comparatively not as impressive as Oreo version of Android is already available. These have Octa-core Exynos 7885 which is Samsung’s own development alongside Mali G71 GPU. Faster and smoother performance can be expected with 8 cores on work. These also have a dedicated slot for micro SD card of up to 256 GB.  The Samsung Galaxy A8 Plus has 4GB of RAM for the phone with 32 GB storage whereas 6 GB of RAM for the variant with 64 GB storage, whereas, A8 has 4GB of RAM for both 32 GB and 64GB variants.  We don’t find as much of difference in the camera department as well. With 3 cameras on each, we can find 1 rear camera with 16 MP and two front cameras with 16 and 8 MP each. The aperture is also the same as the rear camera has f/1.7 and the front-facing cameras have f/1.9. With full HD quality video with 30fps, the videos will have good quality along with smooth video experience. Touch focus, face detection, panorama and HDR functions add extra oomph to the photo taking experiences.  The Samsung Galaxy A8 and A8 Plus (2018) support 3.5 mm headphone jack with a single speaker that makes it loud but probably not loud enough. Type C 1.0 reversible connector makes the charging experience faster and convenient. Radio FM option is also available for the ones who need some infotainment with all their concentration to work. The one thing that these phones have better is the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner which is below the camera rather than beside the camera which keeps the camera free from fingerprints. The Li-ion 3500 mAh battery provides the phone with a longer battery.  The phones are available in black, orchid grey, blue and gold. According to rumors, the A8 could be priced approximately Rs. 56,000 while the A8 Plus might run you Rs. 64,000. With the mentioned details both the phones look pretty promising. One of the things which I found the downside is the size of the phones as both are bigger phones that can’t be easily carried in pockets. Had one of these been smaller in size, they would be more convenient.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SAMSUNG-GALAXY-A8-A8-PLUS-2018-GBN.png']

['Apple Addresses the Issue of Slowing down Old iPhone'],['Apple'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 1, 2018']",2018-01-01 14:40:30+00:00,"['It’s all over the news and it’s real. Apple finally confirms that they have been slowing down the older versions of iPhones to make improvisation on the battery life.\xa0 So what has been the case? Why has Apple done so and what consequences are they facing?  Some Reddit users noticed that their phones were slowing down after they got iOS updates. When tested with Geekbench, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s performed poorly than expected after the iOS update however it started functioning fine when it got it’s battery replaced. An iPhone user tweeted:         After numerous complaints, Apple finally admitted that they started slowing down older iPhones with lower-capacity batteries, mainly to prevent accidental shutdowns since last year.\xa0 Apple made following comment on the issue:  “ Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.”  Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.”  After this incident, many lawsuits were filed against Apple. iPhone users got furious with Apple’s move. It was always a controversy that Apple would slow down iPhones to force the customers to buy a new one but after they themselves confirmed this, there was no stopping by. Apple really has hardcore fans which most other companies hardly manage to have but this incident has created a lot of trust issues among iPhone users and the company.  What does Apple plan to regain the trust of their consumers? Apple wrote to its customers an apology about the issue. To address our customers’ concerns, to recognize their loyalty and to regain their trust,  Apple decided to take the following steps:   Apple reduced the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement by $50 — from $79 to $29, for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later whose battery needs to be replaced, available worldwide through December 2018.  Also, Apple will issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery, so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance.  Apple is working on ways to make the user experience even better, including improving how to manage performance and avoid unexpected shutdowns as batteries age.   In its letter, Apple also says “we’ve always wanted our customers to be able to use their iPhones as long as possible.” If Apple is serious about that and equally serious about the battery being a consumable, these few steps are just the beginning of a major reset in the way we think about maintaining the most important devices in our lives. In any event, Apple has a long way to go rebuilding trust with its customers.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/apple-slow-iphone.jpg']

We recently did the  review of Mi A1  where we opted for the Public Oreo Beta of the device. The update was really smooth for day to day operation and we couldn’t found any noticeable bugs whatsover. Now, A1’s oreo update is out of beta and is available to all the owners of the phone.  Xiaomi promised to provide the Oreo update before the end of 2017 and they are right on time keeping their promise at the very end of the year.\xa0 So if you own a Mi A1 phone then you should be getting that Software Update Available notification pretty soon. The update is 1107MB in size and also contains the December Security update. It’ll upgrade your phone to 8.0, not the latest 8.1. But it is certain that this phone will\x1b get that update in the future as well. Xiaomi has even promised the update for Andorid P.\xa0 The best thing about the phone is probably the constant security updates it gets. The phone supports fast charging but it was disabled in Nougat for some reason. With the new update, however, fast charging has been unlocked.  Since it’s stock Android, it gets all the goodness that Oreo has to offer. This includes:        Picture in Picture Mode:  Image: Tom’s Guide  Minimize video window on YouTube and other media to continue using the phone with a floating video window.  Notification Dots:   Notification Dots is a minimal approach to make the notifications less intrusive. Whenever\x1b you had a notification, there used to be notification count on top of the app but now that has changed with a subtle dot. This shows that the app has some notification.  New Emojis:   The Oreo update has removed the blob emojis and replaced it with more expressive and colorful emojis. It has also introduced few new emojis.  Smart Text Selection:   With smart text selection, whenever you copy something, Google will identify what that text is and provide you with the option for that text. Like if you select an address, then the popup menu will suggest you the Google Maps app to look for that location.  Bundled Notifications and Redesigned Settings Menu:    Notifications are much more organized on the Oreo. You have all the notifications from a single app bundled as one on much minimal design. The best thing is, you can now snooze your notification and make it appear after some time.  The settings menu has been redesigned and bundled to make it easier to find the options you are looking for.   There’s so much more the new Oreo has to offer.

And even though the name “Umidigi” is itself a new name, the cellphone maker seems pretty determined to make a stamp in the chaotic offline dominated market of Nepal.  Umidigi, previously known as Umi entered Nepal with  5 new devices  with the hopes of providing good smartphones in a pocket-friendly budget. The Umidigi G is one of their offerings on a budget of just under Rs 15,000, which will see it compete with the likes of  Nokia 3 ,  Moto E4 ,  Colors P85+ selfie pro  and a few others.  Specifications of Umidigi G   5.0-inch (720 x 1280 pixels) HD SHARP 2.5D curved display  Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection  1.3Ghz Quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor  2GB RAM; 16 GB internal memory, expandable microSD up to 256GB  Android v7.0 (Nougat)  8MP rear camera with LED flash  2MP front camera  Dual Hybrid SIM (Nano+Nano/TF Card) with 4G LTE  Front-mounted fingerprint sensor  2000 mAh battery  Full Metal Body  UMIDIGI G Price in Nepal:\xa0Rs. 14,900   Build and Design  The phone is pretty sturdy, with a plastic body on all sides except the front, which is protected by a Gorilla Glass 4. The phone definitely looks a lot like an  iPhone 7 , with the antenna lines and the unibody look-a-like back. There is even a small camera bump on the back along with a home button at the front.\xa0        The volume and power buttons have a tactile feel to them. The fingerprint is located at the front, which doesn’t double as a home button for some reason. The charging port and headphone jack are at the top along and the bottom covers the loudspeakers and the mic. And finally, the left has the lonely SIM tray.  Display  The smartphone has a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1280*720. It has a 2.5D curved glass with Gorilla Glass 4 protection. This display is good at an acceptable\xa0294ppi but with washed out color reproduction. It is also pretty dim under direct sunlight and pretty bright for night time usage too, which does reduce its usability by a little.  Camera  This phone has, at most, an average camera. The colors look washed out and out of focus for the most part. The rear camera with a resolution of 8MP aided by a flash felt uninspiring, especially in low light. You really need a steady hand to take even the least decent shot.      Front Camera     Low light            This phone has a 2MP sensor at the front, which is usable. Although the selfies did come a bit washed out, they were far from bad.  Performance  The phone runs on a\xa01.3Ghz Quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. It is a pretty mediocre processor, but thanks to the stock Android the phone does run relatively well. Basic tasks like calls and social media run well, with a few lags here and there.  The RAM is sufficient and the internal storage is also pretty adequate. It’s a hybrid expandable storage option, so consider that before your purchase. The phone does support up to a staggering 256GB of addable storage, which is nice as well.  Software/UI  Software, on the other hand, is a hit. Even with a mediocre performing spec sheet, the software played a huge role in the user experience of the device. The phone runs on a  pure version of Android  7.0 Nougat out of the box, which is nice considering you get no bloatware, no unnecessary lags, and just a simple smooth UI.  The drawback here is, even though it runs on the latest Android Nougat, the UI seems to be a bit outdated. But that by no means is a deal breaker.  Connectivity  The phone supports either two SIM cards or one SIM and another MicroSD card for storage expansion. The maximum expandable storage capacity is 256GB and both the SIM slots support 4G at the same time. The call quality and strenght was average as expected in budget phones like this.\xa0 \xa0  The Umidigi G also features a fingerprint scanner which is accurate most of the times, but it takes about 1 sec which is slightly slower than what I expected.  Battery  A 5-inch 1280*720 resolution display paired with a 2000mAh battery is the weakest point of the Umidigi G. In my day to day usage, I got a screen on time of around 2-3 hours which is not enough for a full day usage.\xa0  The worst part is it takes a little over two hours to completely go from 0 to 100%. So, if you are anyone who values battery life on a smartphone, you should probably stay away from this phone.  Conclusion  If you are in a market for a Rs.15,000 smartphone, you will be confused with a lots of option. But, among all the bunch, Umidigi G offers better design and excellent user experience. At Rs.14,900, it is a good option and puts up a decent challenge against the competition. However, it is not perfect as it lacks to compete against phones like Gionee X1 and Xiaomi Mi A1 in the camera and battery department.

Latest Price: Rs. 57, 500 (6/64GB) | Rs. 72,900 (8/128GB) [Last Updated on July 25, 2019]  OnePlus is well-known to deliver great performance at a relatively low price. The OnePlus 5T, on paper, doesn’t seem to disappoint either. It has a refreshed 18:9 display panel and some top of the line specs. It’s an impressive choice for any OnePlus or Android fans in general.        However, the base model of the 5T is available for Rs. 64,900 which is really high as compared to its pricing in India (Rs. 32,999) and the US ($499). OnePlus is known in the world of smartphones as the company that provides flagship-grade features in a cheaper device. However, in Nepal, the device’s price tag is way too high. And it also makes no sense to make the 5T available in Oliz Store only!   If you are looking for a device and have the cash, the OnePlus 5T is a no-brainer. With a better SoC, more RAM options, a whole new design and much more, it will be worth the upgrade.

This year we have the Note 8 with another minute problem, and that problem is its battery.  No, the Galaxy Note 8 isn’t exploding, it’s a rather odd problem. Users are reporting that their devices aren’t turning back on after their phones\xa0turned off from complete battery drainage.   Now when we use the whole 100% of the battery and then some, our phones also turn off. We just plug the charger into the phone and it takes about 2-3 mins before it boots up again. Well, some Note 8 users thought the same thing, just to find out that their smartphones never charged back up.        The problem here seems to be that the device refuses or fails to charge back up. If you are one of the users who has this problem, you should contact Samsung for a replacement. Some users have also reported the same in Samsung’s community forum, you can check it out  here .  There are also reports of the  Galaxy S8 Plus  facing the same issues but we will have to wait and see until Samsung officially acknowledges this.

['Samsung Galaxy Tab A 2017 Review: The family device'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['December 25, 2017']",2017-12-25 06:49:53+00:00,"['Samsung has been consistent in producing tablets as a product in their Android product line. However, people less apt to buy tablets because smartphones have started coming in bigger sizes. With such trend evident in the market, Samsung has brought yet another tablet in the Nepali market, the  Samsung Galaxy Tab A 2017 . This device, as Samsung claims is a total entertainer for the people. The major attraction it offers is a kids mode and Samsung’s flagship feature Bixby Home. Apart from that, it also offers a sleek design and a massive 5000mAh battery. With all these features onboard, is Samsung worth the price tag of Rs. 28,990? Let’s dive into the analysis.   Design  I have quite liked the design that Samsung offers on the tablet. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A 2017 is an 8- inch giant covered with a plastic body.         Though covered with plastic, it gives a metallic look and feel, so the device impresses us in this aspect. Also, the device is long but not too wide which gives it a plus point as it is easier to hold with one hand. I have small hands and even for me, it was not difficult holding it by one hand and using it with another.   The device is a bit slippery but it does not hinder the usability that much. Another plus for the device would be the fact that it is very lightweight.   On the right top, we have the power button and just below it, there are volume control buttons. Similarly on the left are the SIM slot/ memory card slot. The top edge carries 3.5 mm, Jack. The speaker grills and the Micro USB port are at the bottom. The design of the Galaxy Tab 2017 is slim and sleek. I don’t have complaints in this department.   Display  Next, let’s go for the display. The device comes with an LCD panel with an 800×1280 pixels screen resolution. The display, I must say has good saturation and the viewing angles are good too. It has ample brightness and the colors look quite natural. However, it’s not full HD. It might be disappointing to some with pixelation.   However, I didn’t have a problem using this under sunlight as well. I have spent hours watching movies on this device and I must say the big display certainly adds value to the visuals. It’s nothing like watching videos on smartphones. The contents look big and good on the large screen.  Performance:  Moving on, let’s go for the performance. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A is powered by a Snapdragon 425 Quad-core processor clocked at a speed of 1.4 GHz. Similarly, it packs a combination of 2GB of RAM and 16 GB of onboard storage.   Benchmark Score Samsung Tab A 2017 Infogram  Now, I have not felt lags while switching through apps, I have felt that apps take relatively more time to open. Similarly, gaming in this device is a big no! Although it’s big and everything and the content\xa0looks good, it was difficult gaming on this device, probably due to the size. And also, games take more time to load and switching between games and apps is slow enough to make you want to close it altogether.  You will feel the stutters there and then when you play a game on this device which is very distracting. For normal usage, the performance is fine. The thing that is very disappointing is that there is no fingerprint sensor on this device.   You can also insert SIM card on this device and use it as for making calls, which is good to know! However, using this device to make calls will cover your entire face on one side.  Software and User experience:  Okay, now let’s talk about the software and user experience. The Galaxy Tab A 2017 runs on Android Nougat 7.1.1 coupled with Samsung Experience version 8.5 and the Android security patch level is dated June 1, 2017. Well, it’s pretty recent, but not Oreo.  The interface is similar to recent Samsung Galaxy smartphones in the market. The UI is very simple and is one of the things I like the most in this device! You won’t find much bloatware onboard, so you are safe in this regard. I mean it comes with a package of Microsoft apps, Skype and Google apps which is a necessity on today’s date. There are some additions to the basic features like it comes with the Samsung’s flagship browser feature Bixby home but without voice assistance.   Similarly, it comes with a Kids mode. Now that is a useful family feature, to who it is targeted of course. When this feature is on, the entire UI has cartoon app icons and everything becomes childlike which is very useful to teach children as well as keep them away from other apps that are not kids friendly. At home, kids will now be using the secure content. There is also a secure folder where you can keep your files safe by adding security to it. There is an entire of kids features like kid’s camera, kid’s store, etc. where secure content for kids is available. This is very safe as well because children cannot log out of this mode without the code that their parents set. Similarly, kids will have a wider range of choices to learn and interact with the device.  Kids Mode on the Samsung Tab A 2017  The device is good for reading books and stuff and it also comes with a blue light filter to ensure eye comfort. I have read a lot of books on this device and I must say I am impressed with the size and display. This tab lets you multitask with the split screen mode which I thought was very useful. I could search for word meanings while reading books. Similarly, multitasking on the big screen makes you feel good.  Cameras  Moving on, let’s go for the cameras. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A 2017 comes with a combination of 8 MP rear camera with LED flash and a 5 MP front camera. The pictures from the rear camera have good color reproduction and saturation in well-lit areas but under dim lights, the pictures are not good. Also while I zoomed in, the quality was awful.     The selfie camera, on the other hand, is okay. I mean just okay. We cannot compare it with cameras of smartphones. Under ample lighting, the images look good. I am not bothered with the cameras in this device because I don’t see myself using such a huge thing to take a selfie.  However, it might be useful to some, so for them, the cameras are decent. There is also a beauty mode inbuilt but you cannot expect the pictures to be very good. The pictures, except for the dimly lit conditions are decent enough.Here are some pictures were taken from this device so that you can decide for yourself what the camera performance is like.  Battery  The battery is the next thing I am going to talk about. The Galaxy Tab A 2017 features a massive 5000mAh battery and I must say that is very impressive considering the device claims to be an entertainer. It has this huge screen wherein watching videos and reading books are the things I have liked to do and the battery has supported me all along. The battery lasted for two days straight.  The first day I watched movies for around 6 hours with using Facebook and Instagram now and then. The second day I read a book for hours. So, the battery-backed me up pretty well. I managed to get a screen on time of 9 hours.  Good news is that it supports type C charger so yes it’s onboard with the latest trend. However, it does not support fast charging and to get fully charged, it takes around 3 and half hours, which is a lot of time! Although it lasts long, it takes a lot of time to get charged. Would you like that? Let us know in the comments below.  Conclusion:  So on a whole; I would not say that this tablet is a total entertainer as it claims to be. But this is useful at home for children and maybe for the readers out there. A good battery life, good looks, and a user-friendly interface are the only things I see in this tablet. This, I must say is a good family device at home, for kids and even for the elders. I have seriously used this device only to watch moves and read, which I can do in other devices as well.\xa0 For 28,990, I think the device is overpriced considering this does not feature a fingerprint sensor. You can get a smartphone with better, lot better features at this price.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/asdsad.jpg']

Battery : Non-removable Li-Ion 3080 mAh  Price : 32GB: Rs. 27,000 , 64GB: Rs.30,000   Build and Design:   The Mi A1 is one of the prettiest looking phones under the price of Rs.30,000. One might say it looks like the  iPhone 7 Plus  and it certainly does, which is not a bad thing by any means. This phone is a rebranded  Mi 5X  which didn’t make it to the Nepali market. It has a unibody metal construct with a smooth polished back. But mind that, it’s winter and holding a cold metal phone early morning is certainly not a good feeling. Nonetheless, the phone has a premium feel to it and stands solidly at 165 grams. If you want to make it fancier, you can get the rose gold color. You might have already noticed the protruding camera bump which makes the phone shaky while using it placing on the table.   Up front, the MI A1 looks like any typical Xiaomi Device, moreover, like the  Redmi Note 4 , further similarities remain, which we will discuss in later parts of this review.   The phone has a huge chin and forehead with capacitive navigation buttons residing on the chin. They are backlit and the response is really good.   On the right side, it has power and volume buttons providing tactile feedback. On top it has IR blaster, a missed out feature by many – but a really handy feature to have. And coming down to the bottom, we can find a USB C port which still is hard to find on most of the mid-range devices. It is accompanied by a single mono speaker on the right and a headphone jack on the left.   I would certainly not rate this phone as one hand usable. The huge chin coupled with smooth metallic back makes it slippery and there was more than few occasions where it slipped out of my hand. So this phone is Gadgetbyte Certified Slippery, so a cover is a must!  Display:   The Mi A1 comes with a full HD 5.5-inch LTPS IPS display. An LTPS panel means it provides high pixel density and low power consumption. The display has 2.5D glass and it’s protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The Color Reproduction is good and the display is well saturated. The contrast is one of the best on a mid-range device with 1000:1 contrast ratio. But an AMOLED panel like that of the  J7 Pro  definitely beats this number. The viewing angles are good, I found no signs of color shifts while holding the phone as per my comfort. You’d definitely enjoy Watching Videos, playing games and reading on this sharp display.  This panel has a maximum brightness of 450 nits, well enough to view under direct sunlight.  Micromax Canvas Infinity (Black) & Mi A1 (White)  But on the downside, these days we already have phones with the tall 18:9 display and the Mi A1 sports the usual 16:9 panel. This may be a dealbreaker for some. So what do you think? Is it crucial to have a tall 18:9 panel on a smartphone or are you okay with the usual 16:4 aspect ratio? Have your say in the comment section below.  Software/UI:   For me, MIUI is one of the best UI after Vanilla Android. Like mentioned earlier, this is the first Xiaomi phone to ship with Stock Android under the Android One program. Comparing MIUI against the Stock Android, you can see the world of difference.   If you thought Xiaomi’s hardware selection was great but the MIUI turned you off then Mi A1 is what you’ve been waiting for. Apart from the Camera app and the Mi Remote app, rest of the System is directly handled by Google, which means timely Android update.   \xa0  And to my surprise, I received the Oreo 8.0 update just after a few days I took this phone out for review. Since then, I have been getting few security updates and bug fixes every now and then. It’s really a happy experience when your phone shows Update Available every once in awhile, it’s certainly not something you’re used to with a mid-range device.   Since it’s vanilla Android, there’s nothing extraordinary here, if you’re an MIUI user then the plainness of the UI might set you back. The small things I liked about Oreo is the faster app installation time, quick shortcuts on apps, well-bundled settings menu and notifications as well as notification snoozing, inbuilt night mode, ambient display and swipe down on fingerprint to access the quick settings and notification panel to name a few. So overall, it’s stock android, it’s smooth, it’s great and it gets tons of updates.  Performance:   Performance in a mid-range device is Xiaomi’s forte and they have opted for the trusty octa-core Snapdragon 625 chipset for the MI A1. And in my opinion, it’s the perfect chipset for phones under Rs.30,000. With 14nm architecture, it is both powerful and power efficient. It is coupled with 4GB of RAM.   The same configuration can be found on the now popular Redmi Note 4. With Stock Android at hand, the Mi A1 slightly outperformed the Note 4 on benchmarks. Well, on the real-life usage, it’s really hard to differentiate in their performance. The opening of apps, general navigation, scrolling web pages, and every other thing you do on a daily basis is a breeze for this chipset.   With 4GB of RAM on its arsenal coupled with Oreo’s optimized memory management, you can well shuffle between 6 to 7 apps or more with ease.    Xiaomi Mi A1 Vs Competition Gadgetbyte Nepal  Infogram  When it comes to gaming, the combo of Snapdragon 625 with Adreno 506 does more than justice for the gamers. Titles like Asphalt 8 Xtreme, Shadow Fight, FZ9 ran without any lags or frame drops. The game opening time was also fairly fast. If you have checked out the Redmi Note 4 then the performance is no different here. Xiaomi has used dual pyrolytic graphite sheets to dissipate heat effectively and playing Asphalt Xtreme for an hour or so I could only feel a mild warmth on the back. So good job on heat management Xiaomi. Also, I must not forget to mention the single mono speaker of the phone with a 10v amplifier which is loud and crisp making the gaming experience even more engaging. Listening to music on loud volume didn’t affect the clarity as well. So, Mi A1 is a complete package if you are looking for a mid-range phone you can game on.  Camera:   Now the dual camera\xa0is something we don’t see very often in mid-range devices. The one that I know of in particular is the  Coolpad Cool 1  which is priced similarly to the Mi A1. The MI A1 comes with a pair of Dual 12MP Camera on the back. The primary shooter is a wide-angle 26mm f/2.2 lens while the assisting shooter is a 50mm f/2.6 telephoto lens. The telephoto lens provides 2x optical lossless zoom like the iPhone 7 and the OnePlus 5. We compared its Camera with  Oppo F5 ,  Nova 2i ,  M7 Power , and  J7 Pro .   As you can see the photos on the first glance look pretty normal but upon comparing with aforementioned devices, a green tint is evident on most of its images. This green tint made sure the colors looked  disorientate. So Mi A1 misses out on the color accuracy. On the contrary,  contrast is pretty good on photos.   Turning on the HDR mode brings out details from the shadows pretty well but misses to bring out better colors. Having said that the dynamic range is also acceptable.    When it comes to low light performance the smaller f/2.2 aperture doesn’t let in much light. The images are washed out, the details are not there and grains can be found thoroughly spread across the image.        1  of 3                                                Now let’s talk about those dual cameras, first off, at good lighting conditions it creates one of the most natural looking bokeh. Bokeh on smartphones are usually a hit or miss but here the separation between the subject and the background is very smooth most of the time. Not only people but it does a good job with regular objects as well.    But mind that, it’s only possible with good lighting, whereas on poor lighting the bokeh has lots of grains and doesn’t look that appealing.   The 2x optical zoom is a handy feature, the quality is good and can be useful for zooming in far away object.\xa0  Xiaomi has implemented its own camera app on the phone and I found it’s manual mode very interesting, it allows you to have manual control on either the wide primary lens or the telephoto lens. Mi A1 can shoot 4K at 30fps and the quality looks good with natural colors. With no stabilization, it is shaky but the details are justifiable. As you might have already guessed the audio quality is pretty bad.   Now coming to the 5MP front-facing camera, the images it produces are good enough for social media with good lighting. However, if you are savvy about selfies then the details are not there and it looks washed out.   And with little deficiency of light it produces washed out images with lack of details. It also doesn’t sport any selfie flash.   Connectivity:   For connectivity, Xiaomi offers a hybrid nano-SIM slot which utilizes SIM 2 slot for microSD expansion. If you are opting for the 32GB variant of this device then the expandability option will definitely prove to be helpful. But hybrid sim slots is not how we like to roll. Cellular reception and call quality were pretty good as well. Surfing the internet on NCell with 4G was also a breeze.   The phone offers IR blaster with which you can control TV, AC and so on.   It utilizes USB Type C which I’ve only seen on GM5 Plus at this price. And if you are curious, it does support USB OTG. For wireless connection, it offers dual-band ac wifi meaning better WiFi reception and faster speed. It has Bluetooth 4.2. Talking about sensors, it has all the essential sensors including the Gyro for VR experience.   Not to forget, it also holds fingerprint sensor on the back. It is quick to setup and unlocks the device in a jiffy. Xiaomi phones always have had a reliable fingerprint sensor and this is no different.  Battery:   MI A1 offers 3010 mAh battery, a fairly smaller size compared to the Redmi Note 4. Smaller size surely means least screen on time and standby. I was able to pull out only 3 and a half to 4 hours. Well, it entirely depends on your usage but most of the time the battery lasted me for a whole day. The 5v 2ampere charger charges this phone from 0 to 30% in 30 minutes and 100% in around 2 hours.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, Mi A1 is a well-rounded phone under the price of Rs.30,000. It has got a lot more to offer compared to its rivals. The phone offers stock android with timely updates, has a sharp vibrant display, dual camera setup, smooth performance, and premium build to name some.\xa0But it surely falls back when it comes to front facing camera, so if you are someone who’s fond of taking selfies then this phone is definitely not for you. \xa0Also, the battery life could have been better. So, if you can live with an average selfie cam, an older 16:9 display, and a decent battery life, then this is the best phone you can buy below Rs.30,000 in Nepal.

['Micromax Canvas Infinity Review: Bezel-less on a budget'],"['Micromax', 'Reviews']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['December 24, 2017']",2017-12-24 11:58:31+00:00,"['Micromax is not a new name in the world of mobile phones. But with Chinese smartphone brands providing better specs with a bigger marketing budget, Indian smartphone brand Micromax have been in a shadow for a while now.  With the new Canvas Infinity, things might take\xa0a turn in their favor. The  Micromax Canvas Infinity  is the only phone with a near bezel-less display below Rs.20,000 in Nepal along with a really good selection of specs and cameras. But can it win the heart of Nepalese audience? Let’s find out in our review.  Micromax Canvas Infinity Specifications          5.7-inch HD+ IPS LCD display with 18:9 Aspect Ratio (1440 x 720\xa0pixels)  1.4GHz Quad-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor  Adreno 308 GPU  Fingerprint Sensor  3GB RAM  32GB internal memory; upgradable up to 128 GB via microSD card (dedicated slot)  Android 7.1.2 Nougat, Planned Upgrade to Android 8.0 Oreo  Dual SIM (Micro + Micro)  Rear-facing camera: 13MP Dual Camera with f/2.0 aperture, autofocus, LED flash  Front-facing camera: 16MP Front Camera with f/2.0 aperture, autofocus  2,900 mAh removable Li-Ion battery  Price: Rs 18,500 (available in the market for Rs. 17,500)   Build  The Canvas Infinity comes with an 18:9 aspect ratio display, making it really narrow compared to other 5.5-inch devices. However, with the thick bezels on the top and bottom, it is by no means a one-handed phone. It is also one of the good-looking phones you can get below Rs.20,000.  At first glance, it might feel like a metal body. But, after inspection, we found out it to be a plastic body. And, I have to say the build quality isn’t up to par with the others. It creaks when in use and is not sturdier compared to phones at a similar price tag like  Huawei Y7  and  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A .   This removable back gives access to a removable battery. This feature was dearly missed in the past when different companies removed it from their phones, but now in 2017, is there still a need for a removable battery? [socialpoll id=”2479086″] Display  The highlight of the phone is clearly the display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. The display is something no other phone offers at a price this low, which is a huge advantage for Micromax.   The resolution of\xa0720 x 1440 (279ppi),\xa0however, doesn’t help much on a 5.7-inch size which just looks pixelated.\xa0The sunlight visibility is fine, but the color reproduction is substandard. It feels over saturated and the colors don’t come near to the natural tone. The display has its own perks, but Micromax’s calibrations make the screen simply unpleasant to look at.  Cameras  Cameras on this device are quite good, both the front and the back. The front holds the 16MP f/2.0 aperture camera along with a soft flash. You would think that with all the hype that Micromax created over its selfie camera, the camera would produce some good selfies. Well, it does and they are pretty good as well, with good details and colors. It’s a lot better than what I initially expected.      Day Light     Group Selfie     Low Light   The back has a 13MP f/2.0 aperture camera which is decent for its price. It’s not as good as the front but will get the job done. To the eyes of a non-expert at photography, the back camera takes really good photos under good lighting with fast focus, almost accurate color saturation, albeit with cooler tone and fine details even after zooming. I, however, found the HDR mode didn’t make any difference. Like all the budget phones, it suffers at lowlight with grainy images.                         Performance  The phone is packed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor, which is a Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The performance is decent, just look at the benchmarks. And if the benchmarks seem jibberish to you, they are fine considering the price and competition.    Antutu scores  \xa0    GeekBench 4 Scores  Games run ok, with a few frame drops here and there, but they are completely playable. And the best part about it is, it doesn’t heat up so much.  Software and UI  The UI is the biggest letdown of the Canvas Infinity. It runs on Android Nougat and Micromax has even promised a planned upgrade to Android Oreo. This might seem great and all but the user experience on this phone is way beyond bad.\xa0  The UI is plain laggy and clearly wants to emulate iPhone’s iOS. Seeing how bad the software was on this phone, I would have loved to see it running on stock android. Micromax could and probably should stop spending their time and money on a customized UI.   And while we are stuck with the default ones, you could try installing a new launcher and a notification bar from the play store which seems to fix a few of these issues.  Connectivity  Connectivity wise, the Micromax Canvas Infinity seems to have everything a normal phone needs to function like dual SIM with 4G, WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS.   However, I found the Wi-Fi to be comparatively weak and the quality of the mic was also something I was disappointed with.\xa0The phone supports two SIMs and a MicroSD card slot at the same time. There is a lack of Gyroscope sensor, but at this point who would even complain. The fingerprint sensor was snappy and accurate but takes about 1 sec to unlock.  Battery  The phone holds a 2,900 mAh Li-Ion removable battery, which will last you a day. I got, on an average, 4 hours of screen time, which is considered average. But the inconsistent battery life was a bummer. An even bigger battery or software optimization would have made the experience a lot better for sure.  There are the usual battery saving modes as well, but they didn’t do much, to be honest. It also takes a little more than two and a half hour to fully charge from null. Although, some people might take advantage of the swappable battery. Let us know if a removable battery affects your decision on buying a smartphone in 2017.  Conclusion  The Micromax Canvas Infinity is a nice attempt from the company by offering 18:9 display, good looks, Qualcomm processor, 3GB RAM, and fingerprint sensor at this price point. It’s a good buy if you can live up with a buggy UI.\xa0And if Micromax does succeed in fixing these problems with future software optimizations, especially with the planned Oreo update, it’s going to be a decent pick under Rs.20,000.

['Xiaomi Launches Three New Fitness Bands in Nepal'],['Xiaomi'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['December 23, 2017']",2017-12-23 14:34:52+00:00,"['Fitness bands and smartwatches are something we have slowly started to adopt and have felt the need of. There were smartwatches in the Nepali market for past few years but due to their high prices, they didn’t saw the light of day. Now more than smartwatches, we have shifted towards fitness bands. They are both cheaper and does most of the things what a pricy smartwatch does. Xiaomi has introduced both iterations of Mi Band and they did pretty good with Nepali consumers. Now they have introduced 3 more fitness bands namely: Mi AMAZFIT Bip Lite, Mi ARC AMAZFIT, and\xa0Mi AMAZFIT.  Xiaomi Amazfit BIP Lite   Amazfit BIP Lite is the only modern looking band among the bunch. Aesthetics wise, it looks like the lovechild of a Pebble watch and the Apple Watch. Sadly it doesn’t hold a build like them. Being a fitness band it has to be lite, hence, a plastic body with the weight of 32grams with its thick rubber bands. Up front, the bezels are huge with Amazfit branding covering a quarter of the area. Then comes the display of 1.28inches protected with 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The watch is IP68 dust and water resistant\x1b.        Talking about sensors, it’s equipped with (Photoplethysmogram) PPG heart rate sensor, Three Axis Acceleration Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, and Air Pressure Sensor. It also has GPS + GLONASS dual-mode positioning. The best thing about this fitness band is its battery life. With 190mAh lithium polymer battery, Xiaomi promises a battery life of up to 45days on a single charge. This includes 45 days (running weekly, half an hour; Notify 100 per day; screen brightness 10%) and Standby of 4 months with time display, motion detection, PSG the GPS continuous recording track: 22 hours. And charging time normally takes 2.5hours. It supports Android devices from 4.4 and Apple devices from iOS 8.

It has an OLED touchscreen display. The Arc will track your heart rate, calories burned, distance traveled, light and deep sleep. It can vibrate to notify you about the alarms, an incoming call or sort of notification. The band is IP67 water and dust resistant. It connects to your device through Bluetooth4.0. Back in it up is a 70mAh battery which Xiaomi promises will provide battery life for 20 days.   Display : 0.42 inch (72×40 dots ) OLED Panel  Protection : IP67 Water and Dust Resistance  Weight : 4 ounces  Sensors : PPG heart rate sensor, Activity Tracker, Sleep Tracker  Connectivity : Bluetooth 4.0  Battery : 70mA, 20 days of battery life  Support : Android 4.4/iOS 8 or higher  Price : Rs.10,500   Mi AMAZFIT Health Band   Mi Amazfit Health Band resembles the Arc Amazfit but has colored bottom panel. The band is made out of aluminum and stainless steel. It also has the same 0.42 LED display. It is also IP67 Water and Dust Resistant. As the name suggests, it has more integrated features which make\x1b it health oriented. While the other fitness bands come with PPG heart rate sensor, the Amazfit Health band comes with an ECG Chip. Now what differentiates PPG from ECG is, the ECG is a medical grade sensor which is much more accurate, can track, predict and warn any possible illness. The band can also recommend users if they should rest or continue exercising. Use of the ECG chip does make it expensive than the bunch but it would definitely be worth it for those who want to check their heart conditions at check. It comes with 95mAh battery which will last for a week.

But among the bunch that we are expecting, two went official yesterday. The two new phones are Samsung Galaxy A8 and A8+, with all of the bells and whistles from the S-series.  Also Read:\xa0 Samsung Mobiles Price in Nepal  Seriously, Samsung Galaxy A8 and A8+ are basically cheaper versions\xa0of the\xa0 Galaxy S8  and the S8+. They even share the same RAM configuration and battery capacity. Although the A8 is actually a replacement for the  Galaxy A5 2017  and the A8+ for the  Galaxy A7 2017 , at least that’s what makes sense.        The A8 features a 5.6-inch Super AMOLED display, which might seem big for an A5 replacement, but consider the infinity display. Because of its  bezel-less design , these two devices have almost the same footprint despite having a difference in the screen size. The\xa05.6-inch screen sports a\xa01080 x 2220 pixel 18.5:9 aspect ratio infinity display and an unspecified Gorilla Glass protection.  The A8+, on the other hand, shares almost the same footprint as the  Galaxy A7 2017 . But this time, it comes with a 6-inch 1080 x 2220 pixels, 18.5:9 aspect ratio Super AMOLED display. The protection is again an unspecified Gorilla Glass variant.                The RAM on both the devices is increased to 4GB (32GB or 64GB storage) on the A8 and 6GB (64GB/6GB or 32GB/4GB) on the A8+ variant. The battery capacity on The Samsung Galaxy A8 and A8+ is 3000mAh and 3500mAh respectively. The big disappointment here is the choice of Android Nougat out of the box, and the choice of single back camera setups.  Although the choice of a single back camera makes up room for two cameras at the front, for some reason. Both the smartphones feature a  dual camera setup  with 16 MP + 8 MP, f/1.9 sensors at the front. On the back is a single 16MP camera with f/1.7 aperture\xa0sensors which sadly caps out at 1080p video recording.  Both of them are  water resistant  as one would expect with USB C and the best Wi-Fi and Bluetooth variants available on the market. Both still have a 3.5mm headphone jack, fast charging and are only available in Black (for now).  The fingerprint sensor also found a new placement at the back below the camera sensors as most leaks suggested. Along with the forced touch on screen home buttons like on the  Samsung Galaxy S8  and  Galaxy Note 8 .  Finally, we don’t know the exact SoC variants, but they are Octa-Core 2.2Ghz A53 processors. We also know that they are manufactured on the new power-efficient 10nm process.  Also Read:\xa0 Understanding the nanometer technology: Why should you care?

['HTC Desire 10 Pro Review: Alluring Looks & Remarkable Cameras'],"['HTC', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['December 18, 2017']",2017-12-18 10:59:27+00:00,"['It won’t be an exaggeration if I mention that our smartphone market is flooded with the mid-range smartphones. Despite the myriads of smartphones in the market, choosing one while buying is always a pain in the neck. And among the same crowd of mid-range smartphones,  HTC Desire 10 Pro  has tried to stand tall with its fancy looks and impressive set of  cameras . But what more has it to offer? Let’s find in this HTC Desire 10 Pro review.  Specifications of HTC Desire 10 Pro:   5.5 inches (1080 x 1920) IPS LCD display @401ppi  Gorilla Glass 4 Protection  Android 6.0 Marshmallow  Rear Mounted Fingerprint Sensor  MediaTek MT6755 Helio P10 Chipset  Octa-core (4×1.8 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4×1.0 GHz Cortex-A53) CPU  Mali-T860MP2 GPU  4GB RAM  64GB Storage, Expandable up to 256GB (SIM 2 Tray)  20 MP Rear Camera with f/2.2 aperture, laser autofocus, LED flash  13MP Front Facing Camera with f/2.2 aperture and Auto HDR  3,000mAh battery with Fast Charging  Price:\xa0Rs 30,000   Design and Build  In terms of design, HTC Desire 10 Pro is obviously one of the most stylish smartphones available in the market right now. The device is wrapped in a polycarbonate body and is remarkably light. In spite of having a polycarbonate body, the device does not seem or feel cheap. The device possesses matte-finished rubberized back crafted with gold accent around the edges and on the rim of the camera. This special contour has given a premium and stylish look to the device. \xa0And because of the lightweight and elegant aesthetics, my experience on holding and using the device was pretty delightful.         All the tactile buttons of the device are placed meticulously on the right edge of the phone. Power button lies at an absolute center of the right edge, which too possesses gold accent and a palpable texture like the  Moto E4 Plus . And the volume rockers lies just above the power button.   HTC Desire 10 Pro does not fall in the group of  smartphones with a bezel-less display . It still has thick bezels on the forehead and the chin. The bezel on the forehead has been the habitat for the front camera, notification LED, earpiece, proximity and ambient light sensor. The lower bezel or the chin has the capacitive touch buttons embedded on it. With capacitive buttons on the chin, I did not have to sacrifice the lower portion of the screen and had been able to make full use of it.   On the left edge of the device, there lies a SIM card tray, where two Nano SIM cards can be adjusted. If you need to expand the storage, SIM2 needs to be removed from the tray to provide space for the SDcard. Not much of a surprise, there is still a 3.5mm headphone jack on the HTC Desire 10 Pro. HTC allotted space for the jack on the top, placing charging port and speaker grill on the bottom. HTC has provided Boom Sound to this device. However, due to the absence of stereo speakers on the phone, the feature comes into action only when earphones are inserted.  Display  The smartphone embraces 5.5-inch  IPS LCD display  and comes with an aspect ratio of 16:9. In terms of resolution, the smartphone joins the league with Full-HD types and possesses a pixel density of 401PPI. The display is somewhat sturdy and scratch-resistant with Gorilla Glass 4 protection.   The viewing angle of the display is decent and the color accuracy is close to natural. The brightness of the display is ample and one may find no issues under normal lighting condition. However, in the broad daylight or in the direct sunlight, it is a little distressing to perceive the entire details within the screen.  The smartphone is also privileged with an ambient light sensor and an automatic brightness option. So with this mode turned on, you do not need to tune the brightness every now and then.  Camera  Desire 10 Pro is a  camera-centric smartphone . A 20MP camera resides on the back, which comes with f/2.2 aperture,  Dual-LED flash , and  laser autofocus . The camera is not just rich in the  megapixel  count but also on the quality of images it produces. The images possess good dynamic range and pack acute details of the objects in the frame. Also, the camera is dexterous on producing images with natural-like color reproduction.   With the laser autofocus, focusing is swift. Focusing gets even crisper with the HDR turned on. However, with the HDR turned on, the image processing gets a little sluggish. And if the subject or your hands are not stable during the time, the image so produced will be fuzzy.   Even while taking portrait shots, the device astounds the photographers with its charismatic potential. However, because of the narrow aperture, depth of field generally lacks shallowness (the blurs in the background in Bokeh effect).   Low light shots are also pretty impressive with the device. Images shot under dim light or during the nights invite negligible amount of noises and grains, which are generally inconspicuous even when zoomed in. The rear camera also possesses the pro mode where one can tweak the white balance, shutter speed, and ISO values if the auto mode failed to replicate a satisfactory shot. And the best thing about the pro mode is, it can save the images in RAW format.   Up front, there is a 13MP camera dedicated to the selfies. The front shooter too captures great selfies readily uploadable on the social media like  Facebook   and  Instagram . There is also a makeup mode for the selfie fanatics, who are used to with the instant beautification. In addition, there is a selfie panorama mode, which could be useful for taking wide-angle selfies. This mode can be a savior while taking a selfie among a large group of friends.   Despite being a great performer on taking still shots, the device gets a little less fascinating in the videography section. The device records only Full-HD videos at max and shooting a 4K video is not its cup of tea. But for those who are not resolute on the 4K recording inability, the device may entertain with its Zoe camera and Hyperlapse mode. The Zoe camera mode helps the user record a video of three seconds with sound. This feature could be handy when recording a moment, which could not be captured in an image. The Hyperlapse mode, however, captures time-lapse videos at the speed of 2x to 12x. And what excited me of all was the feature which let me alter the speed of the Hyperlapse videos even later.  Performance  The device is powered by MediaTek Helio P10 chipset, which houses an Octa-core CPU clocked at 1.8GHz. The device has embraced Mali-T860MP2 GPU to process and monitor the graphics related tasks within it. And in terms of RAM and ROM, the device lacks variants and only comes in 4GB RAM and 64GB onboard storage format. With a whopping 4GB of RAM, multitasking is delightful in this phone. Even on switching and multitasking the heavy apps and games, the smartphone does not break into a sweat.   Infogram  MediaTek has been a diverting name as a chipset in the smartphone market these days because of the users’ preference for  Qualcomm ’s Snapdragon chipset. Despite the presence of a MediaTek chipset on the phone, I find no issues on it regarding its performance during my time of use. Even on playing high-end games likes  Asphalt 8 , Dead Trigger 2, Dream League Soccer, PES 2018, etc., I did not find any lags and stutters. On lingering with the aforementioned games, the device warmed up a little. Such warmth in smartphones is generally obvious with graphics-intense games like that.   Infogram  Software  The smartphone runs on Android Marshmallow (v6.0). The outdated OS on the phone turned me off, to be honest. But that sourness abruptly faded away when I received a notification about the software update. Not just one, there were back-to-back two updates for the device. However, the updates were for the bug fixes and security patches, the device still runs on Android Marshmallow.   The smartphone is not free from bloatware. It has given spaces for the apps like Boost+, Zoe Video Editor, News Republic, etc. Boost+, as the name implies, dedicates itself to boosting the performance by optimizing apps and clearing junk files. Zoe editor comes handy when making amendments to the videos on the device. This app is also quite useful for making a slideshow like videos using the images and selecting a suitable sound clip. The News Republic app gathers news articles from reputed sources all around the globe and stacks them by classifying on a number of categories.  Security  In addition to pin, password and pattern lock, the smartphone has a fingerprint sensor as a biometric means for security and protection option. The fingerprint sensor on the device resides on the back and is incredibly sensitive. It unlocks the smartphone almost instantaneously. In addition, the fingerprint sensor doubles as a shutter button while taking selfies.   The device also includes other fancy methods for unlocking the device like Face Unlock and Voice unlock in smart unlock option. However, these means for security are not reliable and can be fooled easily. I tried using the image of a registered face from another smartphone, surprisingly, the smartphone unlocked without any messages. The smartphone takes a little more than a second to unlock the device using Face Unlock. Also, under low lights, this feature is absolutely useless. So choosing a fast and reliable fingerprint sensor over the sluggish and unreliable Face Unlock is an absolute no-brainer.  Battery  Focusing on fancy design and remarkable cameras,  HTC  seems to have given less attention to the battery. A 3000mAh battery juices the smartphone. This value is not on par with the smartphones of the similar price range. Not just on the paper, the smartphone failed to provide a prolonged battery life even on the real-life scenario.  Even on normal use, the smartphone failed to back me up for one complete day. With 4-5 hours of screen-on-time, the backup may disappoint the power users. However, the smartphone comes with a  fast charging technology  (5V/2A), who hates the prolonged company of smartphone with the wall charger. HTC Desire 10 Pro gets completely juiced up (0-100%) in less than one and half hours.  Verdict  Unarguably, the smartphone has a remarkable set of cameras and a superfast fingerprint sensor. The smartphone is also alluringly stylish in terms of design and feels great on use. However, one has to admit that the smartphone is a year old device with an outdated OS. \xa0The Desire 10 Pro also lacks a noteworthy battery. So at the price of Rs. 30,000, the smartphone does not fall on my recommendation. At the similar price, striding towards the  Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro ,  Xiaomi MI A1 ,  Huawei Nova 2i  or  Samsung Galaxy J7 Max  would undoubtedly be a better choice.     Oops  Wows    Outdated OS  Remarkable Cameras    Average battery Capacity  Stylish & Premium Design    Dull UI  Fast Fingerprint sensor     I had used the smartphone for two weeks and those are my insights regarding the phone. What do you think of the phone? Does it fall on your radar of choices?

['Micromax Canvas Infinity Early Impressions'],[],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['December 17, 2017']",2017-12-17 09:26:50+00:00,"['The  Rs. 20,000 price bracket  is getting lots of competition of late with almost all smartphone manufacturer coming up with the new models. The Indian smartphone brand,  Micromax  also launched a new smartphone, the Canvas Infinity, which is priced competitively at Rs. 18,500.  Micromax is offering a new 18:9 aspect ratio display in this price range, until now were only available in midrange flagships and high-end phones. The display size is of 5.7-inch with IPS LCD technology and HD resolution. At first sight, the display looks decent, but quickly you will notice the brightness is not as good as one would expect at this price range.   The phone has a budget-friendly 1.4GHz Snapdragon 425 processor paired with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable storage. We can expect the performance to be acceptable with the choice of SOC and 3GB of DDR3 RAM.        Micromax has worked cleverly to make the feel of the device like metal body. It’s a plastic body with a metallic finish. The back is also removable giving you access to the battery. A user replaceable battery could be ideal for power-hungry users.  The build, however, doesn’t feel sturdy like I expected. Talking about the battery, it has a 2980mAh. Paired with an underpowered SoC and an HD display, we remain optimistic.  The 16MP front camera is where the Infinity shines. I took few selfies and it looks promising. It’s not the best selfie machine out there, but at this price point, we cannot complain much. Also, the front flash is just another bonus.     On the back, we get a 13MP sensor, which looks promising during my usage in daylight conditions.    The fingerprint scanner is located at the back and its not that fast. Its usable, but i was hoping for a better one.   The phone comes with Android Nougat out of the box. Micromax also claims it will soon be upgradable to Android Oreo. It is also a dual sim setup with almost all of the important sensors present.  The software is highly inspired from iOS. The UI lagged and the animation of the notification center is slow and annoying.  Sluggish UI Animation on Canvas Infinity  Early Impressions:  The USP of the device is the 18:9 display and a 16MP front camera. The hardware configuration is also decent for its price. But the iffy software, the UI experience expectation remains low. Although most of it can be fixed through a software update and we hope Micromax will roll out the update soon.  We will be testing the device for few more days and be coming up with the full in-depth review.

Researchers from the University of New South Wales are behind this feat clearing a way to create super powerful computers which will be able to perform calculations that can solve wide range of scientific problems such as climate change or even show the proper way to cure diseases like cancer.  Dr Andrew Dzurak, member of the research team, said, “We often think of landing on the moon as humanity’s greatest technological marvel. But creating a microprocessor chip with a billion operating devices integrated together to work like a symphony – that you can carry in your pocket – is an astounding technical achievement, and one that’s revolutionised modern life.”  “With quantum computing, we are on the verge of another technological leap that could be as deep and transformative. But a complete engineering design to realise this on a single chip has been elusive. I think what we have developed at UNSW now makes that possible.”        According to the researchers, the chip will now help create millions of quantum bits and make a computer with computing speed million times faster than conventional computers. In short, it will be able to solve different issues in under a couple of days, an issue which today’s computer takes millions of years to complete.  Dr Menno Veldhorst, who led the study, said, “Remarkable as they are, today’s computer chips cannot harness the quantum effects needed to solve the really important problems that quantum computers will. To solve problems that address major global challenges, it’s generally accepted we will need millions of qubits working in tandem.”  “To do that, we will need to pack qubits together and integrate them, like we do with modern microprocessor chips.

If your answer is yes, you might be actually doing yourself severe harm. According to the California Department of Health, people need to place their smartphone as far as possible while sleeping in order to decrease the exposure risk and diseases that follow. The department claims that sleeping anywhere closer than arm’s length of a smartphone could mean cancer and infertility.  The California Department of Health released a guidance on Thursday regarding the exposure risk of mobile phone radiation. There have been multiple reports regarding mobile phones radiation while sleeping with some even claiming that they cause radiation while using normally. This guidance follows cities like San Francisco and Berkeley, where officials recently warned the risk of sleeping near one’s mobile phone.  Read More:   Smartphone Radiation: A Major Health Risk?        Dr. Devra Davis, official, Environment Health Trust, says, “Keeping a phone directly on the body has never been a good idea.”  Mobile phones use radiofrequency to transmit information. This frequency, although it is low, might be exposing us to harmful radiation, if the claims of the health officials are true. There are numerous research reports which claim that even under normal usage, mobile phones can cause radiation.  Apple includes a radiofrequency exposure notice in its smartphones’ settings with numerous mobile phone manufacturers also agreeing to this issue.  Dr. Devra Davis mentions, “Most people are not aware that there is a clear warning to keep the phone off the body embedded in the phone. This is particularly worrisome because most parents aren’t aware of these warnings are not managing their children’s expo California Department of Health sure to phones.”  The notice from the California Department of Health emphasizes on the subject of radiofrequency easily penetrating the brain matter of kids.

Going up against the two smartphones of the A-series will be LG K10 (2018). The device will be a successor to this year’s K10 which, like all LG smartphone, didn’t launch here in Nepal. It will sport a 5.3-inch screen with a full HD device. The device will feature 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage and a traditional camera setup measuring 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel for the rear and front camera respectively. It will launch in Korea late January with pricing yet to be confirmed.  The flagship devices of Samsung and LG – Galaxy S9 and G7, according to rumors, is set to be introduced “after February”.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CES-2018-banner.jpg']

Shazam one of the most popular apps that answers a very important question – “What’s that song?” The app has over a hundred million downloads in Google’s play store alone. And why would it not, an app that can recognize any song in seconds, find lyrics, provide links to buy them, and even find tickets to the artists’ concerts.  Apple has acquired\xa0Shazam for around $400 million. A smart decision for Apple Music, which will perfectly go hand in hand with Shazam. The music recognizing app actually delivers around a million clicks to apple music and Spotify through referrals. And that is a huge number, in any case, Spotify happens to lose all those referrals.  Other than possibly eliminating one of their biggest music streaming rivals, there are a few other reasons why Apple aquired Shazam. The service can very well go hand in hand with Siri, unlocking a new platform of abilities.        There are also other aspects like the augmented reality. Shazam’s abilities can very well be put to good use as iPhone X’s exclusive features. The most important subject of this aquisition is the data that Shazam holds.  The musical preference of millions of users outside its ecosystem is also something to think about. Shazam is an android app too, and apple can definately use a little outside information from those millions of Android users.  But most music industry enthusiasts believe that the app doesn’t have much of a standalone purpose even with the company’s initial evaluation of $1 billion dollars, and now being sold for $400 million. The fact that it brought out around $54 million as revenue in 2016 didn’t help either.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shazam.jpg']

['OPPO F5 Review: The Pretentious Selfie Expert'],"['Android', 'OPPO', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['December 14, 2017']",2017-12-14 15:30:27+00:00,"['Oppo has been focusing on the selfie camera of almost all the smartphones it makes and the newly launched OPPO F5 promises to capture the “real you”. So, I took the camera smartphone for a real testing, not forgetting its new display which has an 18:9 ratio. So how does it really fare? Does the OPPO F5 tick every box? Let’s check it out in this review. But before I start, let me just get all the specs out of the way.   OPPO F5 Specifications:   Display : 6.0 inches LTPS IPS LCD  Resolution : 2160 x 1080 pixels, 18:9 aspect ratio, 402PPI pixel density  OS : Android Nougat (v7.1.1) with ColorOS 3.2 UI on the top  Chipset : MediaTek MT6763T Helio P23  GPU : Mali-G71 MP2  RAM : 4GB/6GB RAM  Storage : 32GB/64GB internal storage, expandable up to 256GB (dedicated slot for microSD card)  Rear Camera : 16MP, f/1.8, phase detection autofocus, LED flash  Front Camera : 20MP, f/2.0, 1/2.8-inch sensor  Connectivity : Dual SIM, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, A-GPS, USB-OTG, 3G, 4G LTE  Sensors : Fingerprint (rear mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass  Battery : 3200mAh (non-removable)  Colors : Black, Gold, Red (6GB variant only)  Oppo F5 Price in Nepal : Rs. 33,990 (4GB/32GB)  Oppo F5 Price in Nepal : Rs. 44,990 (6GB/64GB/Red color)   Camera         The 20-megapixel selfie camera is definitely the USP of the F5. OPPO is bragging about the Artificial intelligence capability of this camera to beautify a selfie, so I had to put that to the test. And I have to say I didn’t like the beauty mode at all. Take these images as an example.   Taking a normal picture, everything looked good, I was impressed by the fact that the camera could brighten up a picture when I was taking the picture on the left. On the right, however, OPPO amazingly erased the mole on my forehead. I have never seen a single smartphone do this. And look at my skin tone. Why would anyone like a picture with such skin tone? And why are my eyes sparkling? Yes, a couple of people on Instagram might like this new AI compatible selfie shooter, but is it for everyone? Not at all. And under low light setup, the picture I took from normal mode looks much much better than the one taken from the beauty mode as you can see in these two pictures.   Yes, the normal selfie mode takes good pictures but there is nothing to be home about as lots of smartphones are capable of taking better pictures, with the Huawei Nova 2i being a prime example. Here is a comparison shot between the two devices:   On the rear side sits a 16MP camera which is decent at its best. Under ample lighting, the device can capture pictures with good color reproduction and saturation. But I wasn’t at all impressed by the HDR mode. The HDR enabled picture on the right\xa0only has a little bit of increased exposure.   In short, even though OPPO claims itself as a great camera smartphone, the OPPO F5 has what we call “an average at its best” lenses.                            Performance and Software   The OPPO F5 with its new octa-core Helio P23 processor and Mali G71 GPU performs quite well considering its price tag. The device scored higher on Antutu as compared to the Huawei Nova 2i and the J7 Pro. The dual-core GPU of the device also has a respectable score as it outperforms the Nova 2i and the J7 Pro.   Antutu Score  Infogram  These stats are emulated well on real life performance as the device, with its 4 GB RAM handles most of the things thrown at it.   Basemark X (GPU Test)  Infogram  Gaming on this device yields good results and multitasking is great. However, sometimes there are lags here and there, and I think it’s the software of this device that is solely responsible.  Words cannot describe how disappointed I am with Oppo F5’s user interface. The skin on top of Android Nougat is truly a copy of Apple’s iOS. And while I am okay with manufacturers’ choice to copy good things of another manufacturer, OPPO has included some of the worst features of iOS.                      Take the notification shade and the control center for example. You should also know that it takes two taps to remove a notification. Everything about this skin is a whole lot of disappointment. And the heavily skinned Android is what causes stutters here and there. But there is a sound amplifying dac embedded into the UI which helps produce louder sound while using earphones!  Display   Well, OPPO isn’t just cashing in on the camera setup of its new smartphone. It is now one of the few smartphone manufacturers to include the narrower 18:9 aspect ratio on a mid-range device. So, in short, this device’s display will be directly compared with the Huawei Nova 2i. Lets forget about the nits and other geeky terms to explain this display and rather focus on the real-world usage. The OPPO F5’s full HD display produces deeper blacks thus resulting in an excellent contrast. For a device worth 34k, it has good sharpness and enough brightness to use it under the brightest of lights. But like I said before, this smartphone will go up against Huawei Nova 2i. And side by side, the Nova 2i certainly has better saturation and color reproduction. And don’t even get me started on how it performs against the Galaxy J7 Pro. The Super AMOLED display of the J7 Pro is the best display on any midranger in 2017 even with a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio.  You will have to give up on one-handed usage though as the 18:9 form factor and the 6-inch display don’t help with the cause. But the newer type of display certainly helps amplify multimedia and gaming experience.  Design   With this new display  format , OPPO has certainly impressed many. You too will be impressed with the screen while holding the smartphone, right before you start noticing that the back is actually made of plastic. Well, this is due to the polycarbonate plastic backing that OPPO apparently opted to cut cost. Vivo has done the same thing with its new V7!  The polished plastic tries to emulate modern 2017 looks. I have to admit that, the rear side is great looks wise. It’s somewhat similar to the iPhone 7. But on-hands, you will understand how OPPO has cleverly worked to make it feel look like metal.  The polycarbonate back certainly helps in a better grip though, which is not at all possible with metallic backs. This back borders the basic volume rockers and power button, which are also made of plastic. On the bottom lies a single mono speaker which is only average.  Sensors   On this polycarbonate body sits an oval shaped fingerprint scanner and believe me it’s one of the most fastest sensor. It is capable of unlocking the device in a jiffy and not once has it given up on me yet.  Oppo has also imitated Apple by including a face unlock system. Although this security option can intelligently differentiates between a real face and a picture, I have had mixed feelings about this security option as it works only 95% of the time. I even had issues while registering my face as the smartphone constantly nagged me about the angle and the lighting I was in. And if you are in a poorly-lit condition, the face unlock might not even work sometimes. But when it worked, it was fast, really really fast.  Battery   The battery life of the OPPO F5 is quite good to be honest. During my day-to-day usage, the battery certainly lasted for a whole day. The standby time of this 3,200 mAh battery is great as well. The choice of processor, although it is of 16nm, has helped the cause.  You will be dissatisfied to know about the lack of fast charging support, though. So it will take you over 2 hours to completely juice up the device. You have your very own VOOC charging ability at helm. Make a good use of it!  Connectivity and Call Quality   The OPPO F5 has dual SIM slots, like most of the smartphones that launch in Nepal these days. On a plus side, there is also a separate microSD card slot. So, buyers will not have to worry about having to compromise on either a SIM card or a microSD card. And both the NTC and Ncell SIMs work perfectly fine on the device. The people on the other end never really complained about the call quality, and I was hearing everything perfectly fine.  Conclusion  The OPPO F5 is a selfie oriented device like all OPPO smartphones. In the end, this review begs a question, “Is OPPO F5 something you should invest in?” Well, that depends. While I personally might not be that into selfies, this device could be a good buy for someone who is really into the selfie experience. Also, it has a bright display with a new aspect ratio which is great for gaming and multimedia experience. But the Nepali market has become so competitive that what the OPPO F5 lacks is easily available on other smartphones in the same price range.  If you aren’t impressed with what OPPO F5 offers, you might want to check out devices like the  Huawei Nova 2i ,  Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro  or the  Xiaomi Mi A1.

['HTC Desire 650 Dual Review: Good looking but Average Performer'],"['HTC', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['December 14, 2017']",2017-12-14 10:18:46+00:00,"['HTC phones have been on the market for quite some time but they don’t seem to be grabbing much attention. HTC phones, well, they look unique and have a different aura in them but they sure are nothing new from the already existing heap of phones in the market. We took a shot at the latest offering from HTC, the Desire 650, which is a budget phone priced at Rs.20,666.  Now, Rs.20,000 is a very sweet spot for buyers as this is the price segment where most of the people have their budget set. Not to mention this price range has full of amazing smartphones so how does it stack up against the others in this category? Let’s find out in this review.  HTC Desire 650 Dual Specifications   5-inch HD IPS display\xa0with Corning Gorilla Glass protection  1.5GHz Quad-Core MediaTek MT6737T processor with Mali-720 MP2 GPU  3GB RAM, 32GB internal memory, expandable memory up to 256GB  Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Sense UI  13MP rear camera with LED Flash, f/2.0 aperture  5MP front-facing camera, f/2.8 aperture  Dual front-facing stereo speakers  Dual SIM (4G), WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, GLONASS  Sensors: Proximity, Accelerometer  3000mAh Battery   Inside the Box  The accessories offered by HTC Desire 650 Dual is nothing out of the ordinary. First off, you get the phone itself. Then inside it comes with an European Chargerwhich has output of 5V 1Amp. It is small in size and has an interesting oval shape. The charger is aided with a 1.5 meter charging cable. The box also consists of an earphone. It comes with tangle free flat cable. It comes with a single button to Play/Pause a song or Accept/End a call. Ear phones come with rubber buds and they are dust magnet and it is equally hard to remove those dusts.        Design and Display   The HTC Desire 650 is one of the most refreshing looking phones seen after a while. The playful color accents with rubber back look exciting. The phone sport a two-tone design language, the upper back portion has a clean finish while the bottom portion holds horizontal lines which HTC likes to call “Grooves.” Also, the teal color splash with grooved lines on the power button and the purple accents on the camera bump is a unique touch adding a youthful vibe to the phone. The power and volume button on the right side are made out of plastic providing tactile feedback but they certainly feel cheap.   The back is removable which is way convenient than carrying around a SIM ejector tool or pin whenever you want to swap SIM card or microSD card. So yeah, the removable back is a huge thumb up! But wait! The back after few cycles (maybe 15) of removing and putting back on didn’t fit well in its place. The left side of the phone stayed protruded creating squeaky sound whenever I held the phone and started using it.\xa0 I checked the locks and nothing was broken either. This led to my biggest concern, saving this device from water damages.   The rubber back is also a dust magnet, especially in those fancy groove lines which take extra attentive wipes to clean the dirt stuck there. So you have to dust off once in awhile to keep it looking fresh. HTC Desire 650 Dual comes with a headphone jack on top which with the proprietary earphones that came in the box sounded good to my ears. And on the loudspeaker, the audio profile is flat. The sound is decently loud and there’s no distortion even at a higher volume. But it’s older model came with HTC BoomSound which this pone lacks.   It’s hard to name any phone under Rs.20,000 that comes with a display bigger than 5-inches and has full HD resolution. The story is same with this phone as well. It sports a 5.0-inch 720p display with good colors and decent sharpness. It is bright and I had no problem using it under direct sunlight. Watching HD videos and playing games was a welcome experience with no color shifts while holding it at any angle I was comfortable with. The phone offers Miravision app to tweak the color temperature of the display.  Performance   Unlike its predecessor, the HTC 650 Dual is powered by the mid-tier MediaTek MT6737T quad-core CPU clocked at 1.5GHz. Navigation around the UI and scrolling is flawless. The opening of apps is somewhat fast and juggling between open apps with 3GB of RAM is possible without breaking a sweat. So daily run of the mill is hassle-free with this phone. Now for those, who want extra out of their bucks, is it good for gaming?  Well, you can certainly play games like Asphalt 8 and Modern Combat 5 at low frame rate without much noticeable lags and mediocre games like NOVA Legacy, online Multiplayer Standoff 2 and Sky Force ran without any issues. Also, no significant heating could be felt while gaming.    HTC Desire 650 Dual Comparision Nepal  Infogram  Comparing the Antutu benchmarks with its rival  Redmi 4X , the 4X scores just a tad higher while the  Moto E4 Plus  scored a bit low. So, when it comes to performance this device is like any other device at this price range.  Software/UI   The Desire 650 Dual comes with HTC’s home-baked Sense UI. It is a very UI with bright color accents and playful themes and icons. It also offers HTC Blinkfeed on the left side which can be considered as a Google Now alternative but can be made much more personalized. I barely used this feature as I like to see my feed inside the native app itself, but for those who want a quick glance on news and what’s happening on their Social Media can get a quick insight from here.   The phone also comes with its own theme store which offers a\xa0 variety of themes, icon packs, wallpapers and even sounds for your ringtone or notification tone.   The phone comes with Boost+ app which is like a System Manage found on most of the Chinese OEM’s. It offers options to Clear Cache & Temporary files, Uninstall apps in bulk, Optimize background apps, and Pin or Password Lock apps as well.   The UI of widgets menu for home screen is also something I found really handy on this device.   Now all the glitz and glamor is cool on the outside but on the inside, at its core, it’s running on outdated Android 6.0 Marshmallow. And the stock apps like File Manager and Camera are adopted straight from the Marshmallow era which looks pretty awful by today’s standard. This can be a major letdown as Xiaomi phones mentioned earlier get regular security updates and android updates down the years. The Sense UI feels almost as fast as the new MIUI 9 but it certainly lacks a lot of features that its competing devices have to offer.   And among those features, the one that is most disappointing is the lack of fingerprint sensor. Phones like MI 4X, Moto E4 Plus, Gionee X1s and Nokia 5 all come with a fingerprint sensor at the same price range.  Camera  When it comes to phones under 20k the camera quality is something most of the manufacturers compromise on. The same thing prevails on the HTC Desire 650 Dual. Although the megapixel count at 13MP is as high as any midrange well above 20k out there, the image quality is just average at best.   During daytime, it most often tries to overexpose the shots unless you set your focus point from the viewfinder. And even while setting the focus on the subject up front, it completely darkens the image sometimes. So the best option was to let the autofocus come to play. The colors are washed out and the details are fine at best.   If you want to crank up more details and colors in your image then turning on HDR mode will surely help. Unlike other phones, it doesn’t overdo the HDR so it preserves its natural tone. Also, the shutter is quite slow when the light is slightly low and a modest hand movement while taking a shot will most probably result in a blurred shot. Indoors with enough light, the images turn out good.                When it comes to low light, like all the mid-range phones, it has grains and dark patches all over. It is capable of shooting Full HD videos with a 3GP format and they are fine if shot during daytime. With no stabilization available, videos sure are shaky but it also has the tendency to shift exposure every once in a while.   Now coming to the front, the 5MP camera with f/2.8 is decent at best. The colors are bit washed out and there aren’t much details.   In low light, like in the back, you need to have a steady hand to take a decent image without blur and lens flare. Images at night time are basically full of grains with very soft details. Turning on HDR mode also brings somewhat details and natural skin tone.  Battery   The phone is backed by a 3,000mAh battery which given the feeble specs of the phone lasts for the whole day. The screen on time is around 4 to 4 and a half hours depending on how you use this device. However, the phone takes complete 2 and a half hours to charge from 0 to 100% with the stock 5V 1Amp charger. If you happen to drain your battery in the middle of the day then you’ll be stuck near the wall charger or you might need to carry a power bank with you.  Connectivity   As the name of the phone clearly clarifies it’s a ‘Dual’ SIM phone. It offers a single Micro SIM slot and another nano-SIM slot. It is 4G enabled phone so you can surf at the fastest speed available. Calling and using mobile data was hassle free on both NTC and Ncell networks. Cell reception was good and the audio clarity, as well as the audio loudness, was well above. The phone also has dedicated microSD card slot which can be expanded up to 128GB. It’s a very handy addition as the 32GB storage onboard will run out anytime soon.   Pop opening the back will give you access to these slots. The phone has a micro USB port on the bottom for charging and data syncing. Coming down to sensors, the phone has Accelerometer, Proximity, Light, Magnetic and GPS. It lacks the gyro sensor which would have made watching VR contents and taking 360-degree photos possible on the device.  Conclusion  So in general, HTC Desire 650 is a handy device which looks and feels good. If you are someone who goes for the aesthetics and digs the composure of the phone’s color then this device would be a good choice. Apart from that, this phone has very less to offer than what its counterparts are offering in the market. The performance is on par with any other phones at this price range, so if you’re looking for performance then opting for this device won’t be a problem. Where this device lags behind is with its outdated version of Android, cheap build quality, and not so feature rich custom UI.  A better alternative to the HTC Desire 650 Dual would be the Redmi 4X, Nokia 5, Gionee X1s and the Moto E4 Plus providing better build quality, the latest version of Android (for now) and feature-rich custom UI which makes using the device much more intuitive.     \xa0 PROS  \xa0 CONS    Unique Design  Old Android Version    Good Performance  Poor Built Quality    \xa0Decent Camera  Not so Feature Rich UI']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HTC-NEW.jpg']

Gionee X1S  in a Nutshell   5.2 inch IPS HD display with 2.5D glass and Gorilla Glass 3 protection  1.5GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6737T CPU  Android Nougat (v7.0) with Amigo UI 4.0 on the top  3GB RAM  16GB internal storage, expandable up to 256GB (dedicated slot)  13-megapixel rear camera with Autofocus and Dual-LED (Dual-tone) flash  16MP front facing camera, F/2.0 aperture, 1/3.1 inch sensor size with LED Flash  Dual-SIM, Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, FM radio  Rear mounted fingerprint sensor, unlocks in 0.3 seconds  IR blaster  Other sensors:\xa0Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, Compass  4000mAh Li-ion battery  Colors: Black, Gold and Deep Blue  Gionee X1S Price in Nepal: 17,999   Verdict  Lower midrange segment is crowded with loads of smartphones. Smartphones under the price of Rs. 20,000 usually have prevailing features like 5-inch HD display, 2GB RAM, Android Marshmallow and mediocre camera and battery size. But in case of Gionee X1s, it is slightly different. The smartphone is better than the most with a slightly taller display, a bigger RAM for multitasking, fast fingerprint sensor, remarkable camera and a gargantuan battery.  Although the device lacks a crisp display like  Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt , higher internal storage like the  Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime , better processor, Full HD screen and stock UI like  General Mobile\xa0GM 5 Plus , the device may not be the best, but still, it could be a good buy at this price point.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gionee-X1s.jpg']

Since then the smartphone was available in the retail stores. However, the Oppo F5 accessible at the retail stores was in the 4GB RAM + 32GB ROM format. With a view of increasing the memory to store more of your data and to provide assists for the multitasking,  Oppo  had later brought another variant in Nepal, which came with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. That variant, however,\xa0was available only in the Black color.  Now targeting the choosy customers, who prioritize smartphone’s color while buying a smartphone, Oppo has launched yet another variant of the Oppo F5. Amid the journalists and tech bloggers, Oppo took the wraps off of the Red Oppo F5 at Radisson Hotel Kathmandu. The new variant possesses 6GB of RAM coupled with 64GB of onboard storage and no new features except the color. The new Oppo F5 carries a price tag of Rs. 44,990, which is Rs. 11,000 more than the already existing 4GB/32GB variant.

['Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A Review: Wallet-Friendly'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Xiaomi']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['December 11, 2017']",2017-12-11 08:16:15+00:00,"['Vatsal Impex, the sole authorized distributor of  Xiaomi mobiles in Nepal , has brought in yet another affordable mid-range smartphone in the Nepali smartphone market – Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A. I used the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A as my daily driver for the past few days and now, I would like to walk you through the highs and lows of my experience with the device.   First, let us take a look at its key specifications:         Display : 5.5-inch HD IPS display @ 267ppi with Gorilla Glass 3 protection  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 425  CPU : Quad-core (4 x 1.4 GHz Cortex A53)  GPU : Adreno 308  RAM : 2GB  Internal storage : 16GB, expandable up to 128GB via microSD (Dedicated slot)  OS : Android 7.0 Nougat with\xa0MIUI 8.5  Rear camera : 13MP with f/2.2 aperture, PDAF and LED Flash, 1080p video recording  Front-facing camera : 5MP with\xa0f/2.0 aperture  Sensors : Accelerometer, Gyro, proximity, compass  Connectivity: \xa0Dual SIM, 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS +\xa0GLONASS  Battery : 3080mAh Non-removable battery  Latest Price: Rs.14,999 [Last Updated on December 6, 2018]   Build and Design:  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A is completely made up of plastic and comes with a fine finishing with metallic spray paint on top. The design of the phone on the front face is very typical and there isn’t anything particularly special about it. The back of the phone is very smooth and the phone itself is very sleek and has a compact build.   There are top and bottom chrome accents at the back which actually make the  design  look better somehow. Even though I personally liked the build and the design, it sure does not show any upgrades compared to the past releases from Xiaomi.  Display:  The Redmi Note 5A has a 5.5-inch HD (720 x 1280 pixels) display with the protection offered by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The phone offers a lot of settings in terms of changing the display color temperature and contrast. The auto-brightness feature also works very smoothly. Even if this resolution on a 5.5-inch screen might raise a few eyebrows, the display isn’t that bad. The colors appear vibrant and sharp.   There is also a “reading mode” in the display settings that can be scheduled to fit according to the users’ requirement.\xa0 This is the feature that I personally liked very much as I could comfortably use the phone after sundown without having to download another app for adjustable viewings.  Performance:  The phone is powered by the Qualcomm\xa0 Snapdragon 425 quad-core processor (64 bit Cortex A53 @1.4Ghz)  and comes with 2 GB RAM. With an expandable internal  storage  of 16 GB, the phone delivers a good performance, if not commendable. On running multiple apps and games simultaneously, the phone did not stop me with message pop-ups. Lighter games ran smoothly, offering a great user experience. Apps also ran smoothly without any trouble. Hence, the overall  performance  was really snappy and smooth.  During my time with the phone, I tried running multiple apps at the same time and tested if the phone could really withstand the load. I must tell you that the phone didn’t disappoint me. Playing heavy games on the phone was never a hassle as they didn’t lag and the phone also didn’t heat up much on use. Smooth performance and lack of heating issue, made my experience with the phone really noteworthy.   Antutu Score: 36290  Geekbench Score: Single Core: 678 | Multi Core: 1855  Basemark OS: 773   Software:  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A runs on Android 7.0 Nougat and comes with MIUI 8.5  on top . The whole UI experience was really smooth and I enjoyed toggling between the apps and testing the many inbuilt software on the phone. The phone was also very responsive to touches and was pretty snappy at all times. So I personally do not have any complaints regarding its software and performance.  Moreover, Xiaomi should also roll out the MIUI 9 in coming days which will improve the software experience.  Hardware:  The power and volume buttons have been placed at the right side of the phone and are also easily accessible.\xa0   The Note 5A comes with a Micro-USB charging port at the bottom alongside the speaker which produced decent sound even at the largest volume settings.\xa0   There is a 3.5 mm headphone jack placed at the top of the phone and an IR blaster which lets your smartphone act as a remote for your electronic devices. So with this Xiaomi device, your smartphone becomes more than just what it is.\xa0   The capacitive buttons are placed at the chin of the phone. But they are not back-lit so I had to struggle a bit during the night time usage. There is microSD card slot along with a dedicated dual nano-SIM tray on the left side of the phone.\xa0   Connectivity:  As the phone is 4G enabled, the network capacity that it offered was undoubtedly top-notch. The phone also comes with all the necessary sensors like accelerometer, proximity sensor, gyro sensor and compass.   However, there is no fingerprint scanner here, which might make it a bit tricky for the smartphone to create a mark for itself for the budget.  Camera:  The phone houses a 13MP camera on the back which captured details finely and also had a good shutter speed. The pictures appeared a bit washed out but looked proper on decent lighting. Another thing that I noticed here was that the sensor was pretty quick to focus as well.   The HDR option available here helped to enhance the color vibrancy and structure of the images sharply. There are also in-built filters available here and switching between these picture modes was a fun experience. Low light photography as expected at this price range is below par.  Up front, there is a 5MP camera and the selfies taken were decent at best. Better selfie camera phones ( Huawei Y7  and  Colors P85+ Selfie Pro ) can be found at this price range  Battery:  Speaking of the battery back up, the phone comes with a 3080 mAh nonremovable battery that lasted me for well over a day on normal usage and did not let me down. The in-built battery saver mode allowed me to prolong the battery life for more than a few hours before I finally connected the charger to the device.   Even though the device is said to support\xa0Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology, the phone comes with a regular charger. Hence, it took me a little over 2 hours to completely charge the phone.  Verdict:  As the final verdict for my experience with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A, I must say that the phone is decent in terms of the design, build, software experience and performance. You also get a bigger 5.5-inch display compared to previous iterations from Xiaomi like  Redmi 4X  and  Redmi 4A \xa0which had a 5-inch display.  Pros: What I liked about the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A\xa0   The sleek build.  The UI experience.  The sharp display and the detailed display settings.   Cons: What could have been better in the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A   The camera performance  A fingerprint scanner   What is your say on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A?

['Dell Inspiron 7567 Review: Best Budget Gaming Laptop?'],['Reviews'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['December 10, 2017']",2017-12-10 14:28:39+00:00,"['The Dell Inspiron 7567 is a well-built performance oriented gaming laptop on a budget. The fact that it has a good battery life is just a bonus. We know that the 7567 is an older model with 7577 already available in other countries. But considering the high initial price tag and especially the availability of the devices itself, now would be a good time to consider this one.  You can either get the i5 1050 variant for under 1k or the i7 1050Ti with an SSD for 130k. And with those price tags, it’s hard not to consider this laptop. So here is how “the best laptop to buy for 130k” stacks up among the others.         Build  This is a well-built laptop. It is all plastic but you can just see the work Dell put into it. It’s really heavy at 2.7Kgs but the thickness is well maintained under 1 inch. There is very less flex in both screen and chassis, and the laptop itself feels well built.   The laptop has a 15″ screen but holds the footprint of a 17″ laptop. So keep that in mind while buying the accessories for it. The laptop has two huge vents at the back that look cool.\xa0The bottom of the laptop also has two vents for air intake as well.   At the front, there are what looks like a speaker, and it is, but just the far left and far right sides. There is also a subwoofer at the bottom. This laptop has exceptional speaker quality, to be honest. There isn’t much to complain about the build of the laptop. It could have been a little lighter but for gaming laptops, it’s already a little too thin.   Display  The display is one of the places where Dell did compromise. Releasing the laptop with a mediocre TN panel which just seemed faded with very bad color reproductions, even worst viewing angles and an overwhelming brightness level.   Later on, Dell did release the IPS panel, the one that we reviewed. It has a wider viewing angle and a slightly better color coverage. Both are equally bad for color intensive work like photoshop or premiere pro with the display only capable of covering 60% of SRGB and 40% of Adobe RGB colors. But recommend you get the IPS panel if possible.  The display we reviewed had a resolution of 1920*1080, with a 4K option available as well. Although if you plan to buy this for gaming, and you most probably will, the 4K option might not be the perfect fit. The refresh rate is also capped at 60Hz, not that 120Hz was going to be a big improvement for the graphics power.  Performance  The specs on this laptop are excellent. You can buy it in either an i5 or an i7 quad-core 45W processor. The one that we used has a core i7-7700HQ processor which goes up to 3.8GHz, which is perfect for processor-intensive tasks. It is also one of the best processors you can find on a laptop.  The laptop came with a single channel 16GB of DDR4 RAM at 2400MHz. You do get an empty RAM slot so you can upgrade it to a total of 32GB, which is nice. Although 32GB of RAM will be an overkill for gaming anyway.  Gaming Performance  You can opt for either a GTX 1050 or a GTX 1050Ti, our review unit came with a GTX 1050Ti. Although the GTX 1050 will be enough for most, the extra money you will be paying for the Ti variant is worth it.    Dell 7567 with GTX 1050Ti  The 1050Ti is a really capable card that can handle Triple-A titles. Most games will easily cross the 60fps barrier with ease either at high or medium settings. The only exception that I found was PUBG, where 60fps was by far unreachable even with all the setting turned to “very low”. Although this is definitely the game developers fault who have yet to start optimizing the game.  Thermals  Thermals on a gaming laptop are really important, and this laptop does a good job of keeping itself cool under load. The two fans are really aggressive, kicking in even before the programs have started to load. The laptop does heat up somewhere around the “GHJ” area of the keyboard, but the rests stay surprisingly cool, even after about two hours of continuous gaming.   Storage  This laptop can fit both an M.2 SSD and a 2.5-inch HDD. Mine came with a 128GB SSD and a 1TB hard disk. The SSD is where Dell did compromise a little, with reading and write speed of around 400 and 200mbps, which isn’t bad but in terms of SSD speeds, it’s one of the slowest.  You OS will run without any glitches and if you are coming from a hard disk-based laptop, this SSD will feel immensely fast. Apps like photoshops will load within 6-8 seconds and the boot time is somewhere around 8 seconds. Then there is the regular 2.5-inch 5200RPM hard disk with a 1TB storage.  Keyboard and Trackpad  The keyboard is fine for gaming and typing, but I did hope for more key travel. The keys have a mushy feeling for some reason, but most won’t even notice it. The keyboard does have a red backlit to them.\xa0The touchpad uses windows precision drivers which makes up for the cheap build. It is also not very accurate, but it does the job.   Connectivity  Dell did compromise on the connectivity side of the laptop. The dual ban AC WiFi caps out at around 70mbps, so you will be better off with the Gigabit LAN. Especially while gaming, the LAN does a very good job compared to the latency filled wifi experience. Not that the wifi is bad, it’s actually better than most of the laptops out there. It’s just not a perfect fit for downloading and gaming.   At the left, there is a card reader, a USB 3.0 and a charging port. On the right, there is an audio jack, two USB 3.0, HDMI and an Ethernet port. The laptop did\xa0miss out on a USB C port, but then again you can’t have everything.  Battery Life  Gaming laptops are known for their bad battery life. But this laptop is one exception to that theory. Thanks to the huge 74Wh battery, Nvidia Optimus and a fairly low power consuming processor, the battery life is pretty good.\xa0You can get over 6 hours of regular usage and around 2 hours in gaming.   So for 130k, you get an i7 7700HQ processor with single channel 16GB of RAM, 128GB SSD and 1TB of HDD, GTX 1050Ti, and an IPS 1080p panel. You can also get one for under 1 lakh, but that will pull you down to an i5, GTX 1050 and a 1TB mechanical hard drive without an SSD.  Dell Inspiron 7567 Pros:   Well-built body  Doesn’t heat up much under load  Performance is one of the best at this price point.   Dell Inspiron 7567 Cons:   The trackpad could have been better along with the wifi  They could have drastically improved the display   Alternatives  I can think of very few alternatives to this laptop. The HP Omen and Asus ROG GL553VD fall under the same price category but with GTX 1050 inside, so it’s probably not worth it. If you want to pay a little over 15k you do get the\xa0Acer Predator Helios 300 and the\xa0MSI GE62 6VR with the GTX 1060. But if your budget is around the 130k price range, you cannot go wrong with this laptop for gaming.  Buy Link']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dell-cover.jpg']

['ChatSim Review: The unlimited text messaging SIM you should skip'],['Reviews'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['December 10, 2017']",2017-12-10 13:43:52+00:00,"['Imagine this. A SIM card that lets you send unlimited text messages in a bunch of selected messaging applications. Well, that is exactly what ChatSim is trying to offer in the Nepal. ChatSim was launched in Nepal a while back by Future Networks and Technology for Rs. 3,600. I got to use it for few weeks and here is my full review of the SIM.  What is ChatSim?  Well for some of you who are new to the term Chatsim, it is world’s first SIM that lets its users connect to data connection anywhere in the world and use it for sending unlimited texts on selected internet messaging apps. It is currently operating in more than 160 countries through over 250 operators.  How does ChatSim work?  To send unlimited texts via ChatSim, first, you will have to activate your SIM card which carries a phone number of a British Island named Jersey. I personally had to go through a relatively long process just to get it running. The activation must be done via ChatSim’s website.        So how does a SIM card with a number from Britain work in Nepal you ask? Well, ChatSim requires data roaming to be turned on all the time in order to work. It then uses Ncell’s and Nepal Telecom’s network according to its liking, in order to provide the users with a better data connection here.  Verdict  I have to say I was pretty excited to use this new product. Free unlimited text messages sounded pretty exciting then. At first, I had a good time using the SIM too. I could use it to send important texts on the go without having to spend a dime.  It has passed some time now since NTC and Ncell introduced 4G connectivity here in Nepal. Mobile data connection is really good due to the upgrade. But ChatSim only worked on GPRS with the company claiming it supports 3G connectivity. But when I used it, I didn’t really have a problem with a slower connection, since all I did was send texts on Messenger and Whatsapp. The cell reception gets weaker sometimes but there is nothing to worry about. And you might notice the time ChatSim takes for mobile data connection to work, which is a few minutes.  If you are into calling and sending multimedia to your friends, you need to buy extra credits just for this purpose. To buy multimedia credits three recharges worth Rs. 900, Rs. 1,800 and Rs. 4,500 are available.   The quality of the calls while using ChatSim again comes down to the data connection. I for one could only use the ChatSim in GPRS, so, of course, video calls stuttered sometimes. The call connection, however, was pretty good if you ask me.  However, a couple of days ago I had to send an important text to a few people but ChatSim gave up on me that exact moment. I was right beside NTC’s office and even my primary NTC SIM card was working perfectly that time. So, ChatSim has a lot to do if it really wants to impress the Nepali users. I did have a backup SIM card to send those texts then but if someone is completely depending upon ChatSim for their internet usage, they could be completely disappointed at the time of need.  Conclusion  So, should you get ChatSim? Well, it depends on your preference. Are you okay with using a slower connection while texting? Or even an occasional loss of connection? Then you should be okay with investing a whole lot of Rs. 3,600 just for a couple of text messaging applications. As for me, I will be happy with funding the telecommunication companies of Nepal a little bit more just to get a faster mobile data connection for all the applications at my helm.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/chat.jpg']

From every big manufacturer to small Chinese OEM’s, we can find the bezel-less design and the 18:9 aspect ratio, except the Sony of course. But a recent leak suggests that Sony has two new phones in the pipeline ready for 2018. The two phones look quite different but both seem to hold a flagship status looking at their designs.  The first phone has a typical Sony aesthetics with glass back and sharp boxy edges. But it is kind of refashioned with the curved metal exposed on top and on the bottom. It surely looks refreshing compared to other industrial designed phones.  The device also holds dual camera setup on the back. The cameras are separated by a sensor which could have some specific role for photography. Up front, the phone has minimal bezels on the top and the bottom. The top and bottom also hold the speaker grill and the mic. The side bezels seem to be completely eliminated.        Rumors speculate both phones will sport a 5.7-inch\xa0display with 4K resolution. However, a fingerprint sensor is nowhere to be found. It may sport a fingerprint under the display which most of the flagships are likely to have next year.   Coming down to the second phone, it looks like every other phone launched this year. It has a\xa0unibody metal design with rounded corners and subtle golden color. This device also carries dual camera setup and they are close together unlike the aforementioned phone. The dual LED flash resides horizontally to the camera. Luckily, the fingerprint sensor is plainly visible on the back. Up front, the phone looks pretty decent. The first phone with sharp edges surely looks much better with the display turned off. If we look closely at the right-side, the prominent camera button still resides.  As the phone will be launched next year, it luckily doesn’t carry any notch on top. Also, they will be among the first phone to sport the latest Snapdragon 845 chipset. Both the phones will sport 6GB of RAM. These phones will run on the latest version of Oreo. It is speculated that these phones will be launched at MWC 2018.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sony-Xperia-Leaked-2018-Smartphones.jpg']

The Oppo F5 Youth comes with a 6.0-inch display with Full HD+ resolution. Having a Full HD+ display means as a rule of thumb – it comes with an 18:9 aspect ratio. The phone has narrow bezels overall and holds a true 2017 aesthetic. Well if you look at the Oppo F5, it doesn’t differ much from that. The front panel is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 while the overall phone is crafted with a unibody metal. The back holds the fingerprint sensor as well.  The Oppo phones are all about the Camera and the F5 Youth has pretty good numbers when it comes to megapixel counts. Up front, it holds a 16MP camera which comes with Oppo’s AI Beauty mode which promises to up your selfie game. And on the back, it holds a 13MP Camera with f/2.2 aperture. If you compare the camera specs of F5 Youth with the F5’s it certainly feels feeble then again the price is also fairly low. The front doesn’t offer a selfie flash.

But there are more things the Nova 2i than just a pretty display.\xa0  This phone also holds a powerful processor, its\xa0own in-house Kirin 659 chipset clocked at 2.3GHz and comes coupled with 4GB of RAM. We can’t definitely forget the quad-camera setup it sports. It housed dual 16+2MP Camera on the back and dual 13+2MP camera on the front. The phone is backed by a 3340mAh battery. For more in-depth insight into the phone, check out our review of the Huawei Nova 2i down below:\xa0         Huawei Nova 2i Specifications:   Display : 5.9-inch IPS LCD  Resolution : 2160 x 1080 pixels, 18:9 aspect ratio, 402PPI  Body to Screen Ratio:  83%  SIM : Hybrid Dual Nano (SIM+SIM or SIM +microSD)  OS : EMUI 5.1 on top of Android 7.0 Nougat  Fingerprint Sensor : Rear Mounted  Chipset :\xa0HiSilicon Kirin 659  CPU :\xa0Octa-core (4×2.36 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  GPU :\xa0Mali-T830 MP2  RAM : 4GB  Storage : 64GB internal storage, expandable up to 256GB  Rear Camera: \xa016MP + 2MP Dual Camera,\xa0f/2.0, PDAF, LED Flash  Front Camera : 13MP + 2MP Dual Camera, f/2.0 aperture, LED Flash  Connectivity : 4G LTE,\xa0 Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, Micro USB 2.0, GPS  Battery : 3340mAh  Huawei Nova 2i Price in Nepal : Rs. 33,900   Oppo F5  The newly launched  Oppo F5  is a direct contender for the Huawei Nova 2i. The phone is even priced similarly. And the similarity doesn’t end there, the Oppo F5 also carries the 18:9 aspect ratio display with Full HD+ resolution. It sports a 6-inch display with the high pixel density of 402ppi. The bezels are minimal and the rounded corners of the display definitely look good compared to the sharp edges of Nova. And on the plus side, it’s screen is protected by the Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The phone carries a smaller 32GB storage size but has dedicated micro SD card slot and on the other hand, its counterpart holds a higher 64GB internal storage but offers hybrid SIM tray.  The phone is powered by Helio P23 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM. On the optics front, although it has no sign of Dual cameras, nonetheless, the specifications look really promising (*Review Coming Soon*).

Being subsidiary of the same company, both the phone have identical aesthetics. The  Vivo V7  sports a smaller 5.7-inch display with a 720p panel. Opting for the low-resolution panel is a major turn off here. It also carries the 18:9 aspect ratio.  Powering the phone is a Snapdragon 450 chipset clocked at 1.8GHz and comes with 4GB of RAM. On the storage front, it offers 32GB of onboard storage with a dedicated micro SD card slot. In terms of optics, it has 16MP Rear Camera and 24MP front-facing camera.

The phone carries almost no bezels on three sides of the device. The design resembles the Mi Mix with only a bottom chin holding camera and speaker. But sadly, the phone doesn’t carry the 18:9 aspect ratio. The phone, however, comes with a 2.5D glass back which can be considered as a flagship touch.  Powering this device is the MediaTek MT6750T processor clocked at 1.5GHz with 4GB of RAM. For storage, it offers 64GB internal storage with the option for expansion although hybrid.

The phone offers a 5.7-inch display with the resolution of 1440*720 with 279ppi. The front looks similar to the Vivo V7 but the phone is almost 20grams heavier given the same screen real-estate and a slightly smaller battery. Canvas Infinity is the only phone on this list with the promise for an upgrade to Oreo from 7.1.2 Nougat.  The phone is powered by quad-core Snapdragon 425 chipset with 3GB of RAM. For storage, it comes with 32GB memory with a dedicated micro SD card slot. In the camera department, it holds a 13MP camera on the back and 16MP camera on the front both with f/2.0 and LED flash.

"['Anker SoundCore nano Review: Best Bluetooth Speaker Below Rs.2,000']","['Anker', 'Reviews']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['December 5, 2017']",2017-12-05 14:56:47+00:00,"['Anker  is a well-known brand in the tech industry. Their products range from wireless speakers to wireless chargers. And they are finally coming to Nepal. From their wide range of products,\xa0comes a small Bluetooth\xa0portable speaker, the  SoundCore nano (Rs.1840)  which is available exclusively online at daraz.com.np\xa0This just might be one of the smallest Bluetooth speakers you have ever seen, but is it any good? Let’s find out in this review.  Build  This speaker is really small, 2.1 × 2.1 × 1.3 inches to be exact. Enclosed in an Aluminum alloy finish this speaker brings the best of two worlds. A really sturdy design aided by a lightweight body ( 82g ), this portable speaker features a unibody-ish design. The speaker’s build won’t disappoint you, most probably. And with the wide range of  extremely durable Anker products , one would expect a lot.  Sound Quality  By now, you should already be familiar with the speaker’s size. Why this is important is because the sound quality of the speaker won’t blow your mind much, until you actually see how small the speaker is. The speaker lacks any type of bass, and that’s actually a good thing, seeing how light the speaker is.        There is a  3W speaker  that throws out decent sound without much distortion, even at maximum volumes. Also, with the hand strap, you can attach the speaker to your bag or your jacket and just play along as you go for a hike or even bike rides.  Connectivity  Bluetooth 4.0  is on board for wireless music playback. The strength of the signal is fine, and the range goes up to about 20 feets easily. There is even a built-in sound cancellation mic, means you can call right from the speaker itself.  The whole speaker has one port, the MicroUSB. That port is responsible for charging the device and if you want to live the wired live, you can also play music through this port (3.5mm to USB converter included in the box).  Battery Life  Battery life on this thing is fine, powered by a  400mAh , it delivers about\xa0 4 hours  of music playback. Charging takes about  1.5 hours , which is fine too. Not much to complain about in this department. The speaker will keep on playing for more than 6 hours, at low volumes of course.  Conclusion  This is a really good speaker, totally worth it. The mixture of size and weight and loudness is really good. The portability is its main selling point, and honestly, for a speaker this size, the quality is just awesome. You will need to experience it on your own.  The alternatives of this speaker are very few and we sadly have none of them. If you want a highly portable loudspeaker then no other can beat this one. And for a price of just  Rs 1,840 , the device isn’t that expensive for what it delivers either.   Buy Here']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/anker-soundcore-nano.jpg']

The Huawei Nova 2s which was set to launch on December 7 has leaked online and it is going to be the most powerful device in the Nova lineup.  The Huawei Nova 2s comes with a 6-inch HD display with the standard 18:9 aspect ratio. If you have used the  Nova 2i ,  Canvas Infinity  or the  S8 lineup  then you already know the immersiveness of this display. Speculating the leaked images, the bezels all around is pretty minimal. It was quite surprising to see Huawei squeeze in a fingerprint sensor on the bottom chin of the phone. It is good to have it up front but it only makes the tall phone even taller. The aesthetics resemble the  Huawei Honor V9  with a polished metallic back which is sleek and minimal.                      Like the  Nova 2i , the trend of four cameras still prevails with this one. The phone incorporates\xa0dual 16+20MP Camera on the back and dual 20+20MP Camera on the front. The dual setup is likely to assist in capturing the depth of field or bokeh images. Despite high megapixel count up front, the phone seems to be missing the LED flash which was the same with Nova 2i. The biggest difference in the Nova 2s compared to its sibling\xa0is the processor. It houses the higher end Kirin 960 chipset used in Huawei Mate 9 and P10 Plus.

['Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A Prime Review: Above Average?'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Xiaomi']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['December 3, 2017']",2017-12-03 16:43:45+00:00,"['The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A Prime is the higher-end version of Redmi 5A. Both the phones can be considered as an upgrade over the last year’s Redmi 4A or the 4X. The pricing of the phone also targets the same segment where there are already loads of Xiaomi phones. And these phones are yet another addition to the Xiaomi’s pile of mid-range phones. The phone was recently launched in Nepal for the price of Rs.22,499. For the price, is it a good buy? Let’s find out in the review.\xa0\xa0  Latest Price: Rs. 17,499 [Last updated on: December 6, 2018]         Xiaomi Redmi 5A Prime Specs:     Display  5.5-inch (1280*720) pixels    Processor  Snapdragon 435 64 bit (octa-core)    GPU  Adreno 505    Camera  16 MP f/2.0 front camera with LED, 13 MP f/2.2 rear camera    RAM  3GB    ROM  32GB (expandable up to 128GB)    Battery  3080 mAh    OS  Android 7.0, MIUI 9    SIM Card(s)  Dual (nano+nano)    Memory Card slot  Dedicated memory slot    Connectivity  4G support, Bluetooth 4.2     Design   The Redmi Note 5A Prime in terms of design looks like a blown-up version of the Redmi 4A and that’s about it. It has the same minimal design on the back with the usual antenna lines. The only thing different must be the swapping of the position of camera and flashlight. The plastic back has a metallic finish which looks really great but upon holding it, the plasticky feel and the hollow sound it creates – just kills off the vibe. The back also holds the fingerprint sensor which is pretty quick to unlock the device. The fingerprint sensor is also fast to set up. It can act as the shutter button as well. Also, the navigation buttons are not backlit which can be a turn off for many people considering a phone at this price range. This lack sure makes the phone difficult to use during night time until you get used to it.  Display   The 5A Prime comes with a 5.5 inch 720p panel with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection which keeps the phone safe from minor drops and few things in your pocket. The display has 450 nits of brightness which is half of what the  Galaxy S8  has to offer at 1020 units. Even though it’s half of one of the brightest display out there, contents are easily visible under direct sunlight. The display has good color accuracy and the viewing angles are great without any color shifts. But, the one thing I have to complain would be its sharpness. For me, I do a lot of reading on my phone and when it comes to using this display, the sharpness is just not there, the text has soft edges around it which just takes the fun out of reading anything on this display. But the night mode is a neat addition to protect the eyes from the blue light. Viewing images and videos looks good, however.  Performance   The phone is powered by Snapdragon 435 Octa-core chipset which is a decent pick for its price. It comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Performance on this device is smooth when it comes to day to day usage and thanks to the new MUI 9’s optimization, the phone flies even with this mid-range processor. Usual navigation around the UI, scrolling and every other run of the mill is smooth without any lags or jitter. Normal app openings are fast, app switching is fast and multi-tasking between few opened apps is decent as well. If you consider the benchmarks, the Redmi Note 4 costs 3k more than this phone with better benchmarks and better performance overall.  Moving on to gaming, playing titles like Asphalt 8, Drag n Boom and few other titles with medium settings yielded in few frame drops and lags but was playable for most parts. What I noticed was, the game opening time was miserable as I had to wait for almost 3 minutes to open and get to the race screen of Asphalt 8. But, gaming for an hour or so with mid-range games, I couldn’t feel any heating on the back or anywhere else which was unexpected with this device.\xa0 The loud audio from the mono speakers also complement well while gaming but you can easily cover it up with your hand if you’re not careful enough.  Connectivity   This is a dual sim phone which takes in two Nano sims. The reception was good and I had no issues with the call quality even with its loudspeaker. It is a 4G enabled phone and using mobile data was really good with this one. There is no issue of connectivity on both Ncell and NTC networks. What Xiaomi did excellent with this phone is the inclusion of a dedicated microSD card slot, a feature that was missing on last year Xiaomi devices. So now, you can use both the SIM along with extra storage at hand. The phone also IR blaster and it comes in handy to control your TV, music system, AC and so on.  Camera  Now coming down to the camera, you can find a 13MP Rear camera and with plenty of light, it takes good images with natural colors few times and washed out pictures most of the time. It struggles to pull out details from the scene which can be solved to an extent with HDR mode turned on. It helps to bring out more colors and details in the image. But mind the phone takes at least 3 secs to process the HDR image and if it’s a moving object then it won’t be even worth it.    So, in general, at daytime, you’ll be okay in most of the cases with the photo it takes but as every mid-range phone – \xa0it struggles in low light with grains and dark patches all over the image.                         The main highlight of the phone is not the rear but its 16MP front facing camera with LED flash. Despite high megapixel count, the image is nothing much from ordinary. You’ll notice this when you compare it with the 5MP front shooter of Redmi Note 4. \xa0You can see the details are almost alike, but Redmi 5A preserves natural colors. The shooter of Redmi Note 5A Prime has wide angle lens so you get more real estate on photos. And despite that flashlight up there, it doesn’t help much in low-light conditions as the image contain loads of dark patches and grains. There’s also beauty mode which makes your skin clearer by removing any marks, for the most part, I didn’t like turning this mode on but this can be really useful for those who want to up their selfie game on Instagram.                 Software/UI  Talking about preference, I like the playful MIUI offered by Xiaomi and the  new MIUI 9  update based on Android 7.1.2 makes it a whole lot better. Despite few visual changes including animations and themes nothing significant can be seen from the outside, however, the biggest change is on the inside, making the MIUI9 faster and efficient than ever.                   You have the new Quick Settings toggle which is close to stock android except they are really colorful. The bundled notifications also help to keep the notification area clean and managed. The split screen mode is also finally here which was long missing from the MIUI. The lock screen also has been reworked. Swiping left will give you the flashlight toggle and your connected MI Smarthome devices and swiping on the right side will give you the camera UI.\xa0 The bottom line is, the MIUI 9 is leaner and faster than ever making it one of the most responsive customizable UI in Android space.  Battery  Battery life on Xiaomi device has always been good. The Note 5A Prime offers 3080mAh battery which offers 4 and a half hours of screen-on time, and it may vary for different people based on their usage. For the most part of this review, it lasted the whole day with 10 to 5% remaining at the end of the day which is not bad for daily use. And its stock 1Amp charger takes 2 and a half hours to charge completely which is quite a lot if you are a heavy user.   Conclusion  So in conclusion, the Redmi Note 5A Prime is like any other Xiaomi mid-range phone out there. It offers great performance for your day to day tasks and a very pleasing usability with the new MIUI 9 adding tons of features, a capable front-facing shooter which is a great choice for selfie lovers and also provides a decent battery life.

['Huawei Nova 2i Review: Mid-range Segment has a new challenger'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['December 1, 2017']",2017-12-01 17:47:36+00:00,"['Huawei Nova 2i  is a significant departure from the company’s usual approach. The phone is known by many names like the  Huawei Honor 9i and Maigmang 6  along with being called Huawei Nova 2i. It is Huawei’s first phone that has not one, not two but four cameras. This is also the first time that the company is introducing an almost bezel-less display and a set of four cameras. It looks somewhat similar to  Huawei P10 Plus  but simpler and more subtle. The Huawei Nova 2i is a beauty at sight. The screen isn’t the only thing that is interesting about this device. There is a collection of four cameras specializing in producing good quality Bokeh effects on both, front and back.  The phone has recently been launched in Nepal for a competitive price of Rs. 33,900. While the specifications look good in writing, let’s find out what the\xa0reality\xa0is.         Here is a quick look at the specifications:   Price : Rs. 33,900  Rear camera : 16MP+2MP f/2.2 with LED flash  Selfie- camera : 13MP+2MP  Battery : 3,340 mAh  RAM : 4GB  ROM:  64GB extendable up to 256 GB (uses SIM2)  Display : 5.9 inch IPS (1080×2160) @409ppi  OS : Android 7.0 Nougat coupled with EMUI 5.1  Chipset : HiSilicon Kirin 659  CPU:  Octa-core (4×2.36 GHz Cortex- A53 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex- A53)  GPU:  Mali- T830 MP2  Connectivity : Hybrid Dual SIM\xa0 Nano-SIM, dual standby), WIFI b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, micro USB 2.0  Sensors : Fingerprint sensor (rear- mounted), Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, Compass, Ambient light, Barometer.   Design and Display:  If tall designs and bezel-less displays catch your eye, the Huawei Nova 2i is your device. When you take the phone in your hands you can’t help but fall in love with the curvy edges. It comes with an all-metal unibody design which is an excellent material\xa0choice from Huawei. The metal body feels sturdier and more premium compared to  Oppo F5  and  Vivo V7  — Both these devices come with a\xa0plastic body.\xa0It measures 156.2×75.2×7.5mm with a weight of 164 grams, which makes it quite light for a phone of that size.  While I tested the black variant, it looked gorgeous but was a fingerprint magnet. Just a slight touch and your prints are all over the phone. I had a hard time cleaning it every now and then. Another complaint I have with it I that it’s too slippery and when I say too slippery I mean very very slippery. If you are not careful while holding it, there is a fair chance of gravity acting very strongly on it.   The Nova 2i also has a slim profile despite the huge 5.9-inch display protected by a 2.5D curved glass. The size of the phone is still manageable considering the size of the phone, thanks to the 18:9 aspect ratio. For a mid-range device to have an all view display is worth it. The matte finish gives it a classic look. The 5.9 inch IPS LCD display has a screen resolution of 2160×1080 pixels with a pixel density of 409ppi. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing games and watching videos on the big, bezel-less screen. The huge display, however, makes it difficult for one hand usage. There is a one hand usage option but I didn’t like using it.   The display is sharp and crisp, thanks to the IPS panel. The viewing angles are good enough. It does not show odd color tones as the whites are balanced and there is also an eye comfort option which makes the display soothing for the eye. For indoor use, the phone’s brightness is good but under extreme sunlight, visibility is slightly lower.   The power button and the volume control buttons are on the right side. On top is the noise canceling mic and on the bottom, there are the 3.5 mm audio jack, the loudspeakers and the micro USB port along with a primary microphone. The fingerprint sensor is at the back and in swift in functioning. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is quite good and easily reachable.   Camera  The camera is what makes that Huawei Nove 2i so attractive. It sports four cameras altogether. Up front, it sports a pair of 13MP+2MP \xa0selfie shooter and at the back, it carries a brace of 16MP+2 MP f/2.2 cameras both specialized for capturing the depth of information and shooting portraits with the Bokeh effect.  It has a list of camera features, namely, document scan (helps you shift focus to your documents), audio note (helps you add an audio note to your photos) and slow-mo feature along with features like HDR, filters, time- lapse, pro photo and video mode (lets you choose between parameters like ISO, shutter speed, exposure, focus and white balance), panorama, light painting and the night shot mode. The pro photo mode lets you choose between auto and manual focus just like what you can do in your DSLR. Similarly, you can choose what resolution you want to take your pictures in and also you have an option of choosing whether you want the pictures to be in raw format.  The rear camera is equipped with 16 MP (RGB sensor) of main camera and 2 MP (RGB sensor used for Accurate field depth information of secondary camera. The images taken from this device are sharp, crisp, vivid and I must say praiseworthy. The colors are well balanced and the pictures have a natural color tone.   The Bokeh effect works quite properly blurring the background. I have checked whether both the cameras work for the Bokeh by covering the secondary camera, and I was thoroughly impressed to see that the end result is the effort of both primary and secondary camera. The blur can be adjusted as per your likes after you have taken the pictures. The back is equipped with LED flash and there is also a soft flash at the front for selfies, which is great for selfies in low light conditions.  The Bokeh effect works quite properly blurring the background.  The main 13- megapixel camera shoots the selfie whereas secondary 2MP camera captures the astonishing depth of field data. The Huawei Nova 2i automatically adjusts the level of brightness, switching between two levels (5 lux and 9 lux) to meet the lighting demands of selfies in almost any setting.  Left: Normal Mode; Right: Bokeh Mode  The selfie toning light is equipped with Artistic Butterfly Lighting Effect. This lighting is characterized by the butterfly-shaped shadow that it casts below the nose but is at its best on lean subjects with high and pronounced cheekbones. The low light camera performance is at par.          On the downside, videos are only recorded at 1080 pixels with both rear and front-facing camera, so no 4k videos, however, the video quality is good enough. I mean the colors are well balanced but had there been stabilization and a greater resolution option, it would have been better.  The one thing I am not satisfied with regards to the Bokeh is that it takes some time for the image to process. The images look\xa0sharp after taking it and have good details both at night and daylight.  Software and performance  The Huawei Nova 2i runs on Android Nougat 7.0 coupled with EMUI 5.1. It comes with a package of 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage that can further be extended up to 256GB. Similarly, it uses HiSilicon Kirin 659 Octa-core (4×2.36 GHz Cortex A53 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex A53) processor. The 4 GB RAM has not let me down when the question is about app switching or app opening.\xa0These activities are swift as they should be.   Antutu Score  Infogram  Talking about my gaming experience, I have not played high-end games on this device but have played games like Into the dead and Beat racer and they ran with minor lags. What I can certainly say is that this is not the device you would use to play high-end games because the GPU is simply not capable of handling such extremes. However, as claimed by the company, the Huawei Nova 2i is confirmed and designed to running smoothly even after 18 months of use. We will have to see about that.   Basemark X (GPU Test)  Infogram  The new EMUI on this device has lots of interesting features like taking screenshots by knocking twice on the screen, drawing with your knuckles to record screen, customizing notification bar, changing the position of navigation keys, smart assistance, eye comfort feature, among the others. I have had the time of my life showing these features off to other people, who seemed pretty awed. There is also an option to adjust apps to the 18:9 aspect ratio. However, all the apps do not fit in the tall display. The phone does not suffer heating issues, which I think is pretty impressive. It also comes with a lot of custom apps like hiGame and Huawei Health that may take up space on your device.   There were, however, no updates on latest android I received while using the phone. Huawei has promised an android Oreo update soon so, minor lags in performance are hoped to be solved. Again this is not a promise! Up until now, for the time I have used this device, it has performed quite well.  Battery  The Huawei Nova 2i is backed by 3340 built-in lithium battery. While using it on a full charge it gave me an entire day of usage. It gave me around 9 hours of time while continuously using it for watching movies and playing games. On average, it has 5 hours of onscreen time which is good, but not great. There are various power saving modes available that shut down background processes aggressively.   The phone does not support fast charging and lacks USB type-C which in 2017 may be a letdown for some users. Similarly, the Huawei Nova 2i has given me a hard time by taking up more than 3 hours to get fully charged with its charger. The battery, I would say is comparatively average for such a big phone.  Verdict  The Huawei Nova 2i is clearly a very interesting phone considering how it is has stood out in comparison to other mid-range phones in regards to the camera, display, and UI features. I think the device is a worth it mid-range device for the ones looking for good set of cameras and a beautiful display in this price range.  However, I stick to the fact that the battery life and overall performance could have been better when put in comparison to competitors like Xiaomi Mi A1 and Oppo F5. For the ones who are not hardcore gamers like me, this device is worth considering. Like other things, features in a smartphone are a matter of priorities and if camera and display are yours, you can go for the Huawei Nova 2i.     \xa0PROS  \xa0CONS    \xa0Good Cameras  \xa0Battery Life & Performance could have been better    \xa0Good Design & Display  \xa0Lacks Fast Charging    \xa0Interesting UI  \xa0UI buggy at times']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_3189-1.jpg']

It is the most advanced and most pricey  iPhone  manufactured by  Apple  till date. The smartphone was announced as a celebration of the 10 years’ anniversary of Apple back in September alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Manifesting the enticing features, the smartphone had been able to steal the limelight on the announcement day keeping the  iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus  in the shadow, which possessed the traditional iPhone design. However, the iPhone X was a latecomer in the smartphone market in the comparison of the three. And it has been the same in the context of Nepal too.  [Note: Prices are last updated on July 23, 2019]  The  iPhone 8 and 8 Plus  had been available for the purchase in Nepal for quite a while now. But those who were enticed by the alluring specs of the iPhone X had been obliged to wait a little longer. But, no worries, the iPhone X is now finally available in Nepal. And here is everything you need to know about it.        Also Read:  iPhone 8, 8 Plus Price in Nepal \xa0  iPhone X   \xa0  Display  Apple had been using the moniker ‘Retina Display’ with the use of IPS LCD panels and packing slightly more than 300PPI pixel density. Now the new iPhone’s display comes with Super Retina moniker which uses OLED Screen with the resolution of 2436 x 1125 pixels packing 458 PPI pixel density. The presence of OLED will ensure the iPhone X to have a more vivid display and punchy colors than the traditional iPhones.  Design  source: Circuit Breaker  The iPhone X’s 5.8-inch encompasses almost all of the device’s front surface. The ultra-thin bezels have made the device remarkably more compact and come in almost the same size as that of 4.7-inch iPhone 7. And focusing on the bezel-less design, Apple had to bid farewell to its iconic circular home button on the chin. It is now replaced with an intuitive swipe gesture, which can be used to get back to home screen, multitask apps, access recent apps, etc. And along with the home button gone, it took away the fingerprint sensor that used to reside on it. However, Face Recognition Technology has been introduced to maintain the security intact. In terms of build material, iPhone X sports all-glass enclosure with a stainless steel band to add some rigidity.  Bionic Neural Processor  Powering the iPhone X is a hexacore A11 Bionic neural processor. The processor includes two performance cores which are 25% faster, four high-efficiency cores that are 70% faster, a second gen Apple-designed performance controller that has 70% multi-thread workloads, and an Apple-designed GPU with 30% faster-processing speed.  The new chipset included on the device flaunts high processing speed and power efficient operation. And with the A11 processor to power the device, Apple boasts the iPhone X to be the most powerful smartphone till date.  Wireless Charging  With the new iPhone, Apple welcomed Wireless Charging system. This feature is not limited to the iPhone X but is available for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models. The Apple had been closely working with Qi for the inclusion of Wireless Charging Technology. The new iPhones, however, will only be charged with wireless pads that are Qi certified.  Camera  The dual camera setup on the iPhone 7 plus was the most praise-worthy spec on the iPhone last year. With the iPhone X, Apple has given continuation to the inclusion of a dual camera. But this time the cameras are oriented in a vertical configuration.  The 12MP dual camera setup on the rear panel of the iPhone X has a 12MP wide-angle lens and a 12MP telephone lens with the aperture being f/1.8 and f/2.4 respectively. The notable difference to the iPhone 7 Plus will the presence of OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) on both the lenses.  In terms of photography, iPhone X along with the iPhone 8 models will receive Apple’s new Portrait Light mode, which offers to alter the lighting conditions in a shot. On the videography, all the newbies will be capable of recording 4K videos up to 60fps frame rate and 1080p videos up to 240fps.  Up front, there is a 7MP front camera. In addition to Portrait mode, the new iPhones includes Apple’s new Portrait Lighting mode. This mode allows the user to alter the lighting conditions in a selfie.  Face Recognition  Removing the Touch ID, Apple opted to use facial recognition as a primary biometric security feature for the exclusive flagship. With the aid of an infrared camera, flood illuminator and dot projector, the iPhone X is capable of detecting and analyzing faces at a high rate of accuracy – irrespective of the lighting conditions and alterations like a change in hair/beard styles and eyeglasses.  Animojis  The advanced arrays of front-facing cameras and sensors, iPhone X is capable of capturing and translating the facial movements into animated emojis which is termed as Animojis.  IP67 water-resistant rating  The new iPhone X is IP67 certified. It means that the device can stay underwater at the depth of 1 meter (around 3 feet) for up to 30 minutes without causing damage to the device.  iPhone X\xa0(iPhone 10) specs in a nutshell   Display : 5.8 inches Super AMOLED with Scratch-resistant glass  Resolution : 1125 x 2436 pixels, 458PPI pixel density  OS : iOS 11  Chipset : Apple A11 Bionic  RAM : 3GB  Storage : 64/256GB internal storage, No microSD card slot  Rear Camera : Dual 12MP, f/1.8 & f/2.4, OIS, phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, Quad-LED (dual tone) flash  Front Camera : 7 MP, f/2.2  Connectivity : Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, A-GPS, NFC (Apple Pay only), 3G, 4G LTE, USB 3.0 reversible connector  Sensors : Face ID, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer  Other Features : No 3.5mm headphone Jack, IP67 Certified (Water and Dust resistant), Fast Charging, Wireless charging, Dolby Vision/HDR10 compliant, 4K video recording up to 60fps & 1080P video recording up to 240fps   iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus  Just to let you know, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are already available for the purchase.

However, the V10 has an LCD display as compared to an AMOLED on the Mate 10 Pro. The other feature it took from the Mate 10 is its 3.5mm headphone jack.  Android Oreo comes out of the box on all of these smartphones, with EMUI 8.0 on top. Also, the V10 along with the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro features Huawei’s top of the line Kirin 970, and a Mali-G72 MP12 GPU. RAM options also include 6GB with cheaper 4GB variant also available. The device posted an Antutu benchmark of 165,587, which is quite impressive and up to par with all of the high-end flagships.        The camera sensors have more megapixels on the Huawei Honor V10. The front features a 13MP f/2.0 sensor and the back has a dual 16MP+20MP camera setup, but whether this can reflect on the camera performance of the phone, we will have to wait and see.        1  of 4                                                          To quote what GSMArena said,  “It’s as if the Honor V10 took most of the best specs of the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro and mashed them together.”  That being said, it’s disappointing to see no waterproofing in this phone. The battery is comparatively smaller at 3750mAh (fast charging supported). However, you won’t be seeing much of a difference. Finally, the color options include Beach Gold, Aurora Blue, Charm Red, and Night Black.  The best part as mentioned earlier was the pricing, starting at $410 for the 4GB/64GB variant, $450 for the 6GB/64GB one, and finally $530 for the top tier 128GB storage variant. Availability as of now is restricted to China, but we assume it will be available in other regions pretty soon.  Facial Recognition Technology  Remember the iPhone X’s FaceID, yes, this technology is almost the same thing. The only thing is, Huawei claims it’s even better than the one in the iPhone X. They are working on their own structured light 3D sensor on the front, building a full detailed 300,000 points of your face in just 10 seconds.  The FaceID will unlock your phone in as low as 0.4 seconds, whereas its fingerprint sensor will do it in 0.2 seconds. This authentication can also be used for secure money transactions as well.  Animojis  Yes, the same Animoji the iPhone X comes with. It’s starting to become a trend for Huawei to compete with Apple. Huawei’s Animojis also support tongue. We cannot say the same about the ones on the iPhone X. So, now your Animojis look even more ridiculous than it already was.  Both the new features aren’t supported on the Huawei Honor V10. Maybe they are saving it for the P11, or maybe it isn’t ready yet.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/huawei.jpg']

The device is wrapped in a polycarbonate body with metallic texture. So, it offers a premium feel and mimics robustness of the metal-built smartphones. \xa0Probably the lack of metal body is the thing here; the smartphone is remarkably light on the hold and comfortable on the use.   On the front part, the major portion of the device is covered by the display bordered by minimum bezels. The device possesses a 5.7 inch IPS LCD display featuring an HD+ (1440 x 720 pixels) resolution. The display on the device is a FullView one with the aspect ratio of 18:9. Having the trendy FullView display on the smartphone has brought the device to a new level. However, the resolution of the device (which is quite low in my opinion) bothered me since the very beginning. Although the resolution on the Vivo V7 results in the pixel density of 282PPI, the display seemed decent on my use and I did not find the display pixelated under my supervision.  The device is powered by power efficient Snapdragon 450 chipset, manufactured under 14nm  nanometer technology . For the Graphics portion, there is an Adreno 506 GPU. On my short use of the device, on loading apps and multitasking with them, I did not feel any lags and stutters. The device ran smoothly all the time. But as it was on the short time use, I would like to hold my verdict regarding the performance. We will let you know about the performance of the Vivo V7 in detail in our full review. So, please like our  Facebook  and Subscribe to our  YouTube Channel , where we keep our things posted.   The device comes with Android Nougat out of the box with FunTouch OS 3.2 on the top. The UI on the device closely resembles with the iPhones. Swiping the screen down shows the notification panel whereas swiping up reveals the toggle panel. The device also possesses galore of features on the software side like gesture mode, smart wake, split screen, etc. and it was fun to make use of them.  In terms of memory, the device boasts 4GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. With the price tag, the internal storage does not seem to be fitting in my opinion. With the firmware devouring one-fourth portion of storage, the available storage may not plenty for many of the users. So, opting for a 64GB would have been a better choice with the Vivo V7. However, there is a dedicated slot for the SDcard. So one does not have to cut the privilege of using two SIM cards just for employing an SDcard.   The Vivo V7 is a  camera-centric smartphone  with 24MP selfie shooter and 16MP rear camera. The 24MP selfie shooter promises a clearer selfie and on my use, the device delivered as promised. Packing a plenty amount of details and with the natural-looking beautified images, the device lured me all along. Though the rear camera lacks  dual-camera  setup, it also performed well on my use. With the vibrant and well-detailed shots and speedy shutter, the device was fun to play with. But as mentioned earlier, the results were during the use on a short time period, which may not be consistent all the time. So please wait for our well-detailed review, where we will dissect the specs and features further. Till then keep on tuning to  GadgetByte Nepal  and have a great day ahead.

DJI is somewhat a household name when it comes to drones and the company has already made its name in Nepal via its recently launched DJI Mavic Pro.

Don’t Miss:   DJI Drones Price in Nepal  The DJI Spark is a lightweight drone that lets you control the device through hand gestures. It weighs in at just 300 grams and has a 143 x 143 x 55 mm of dimension. The quadcopter has special sensors through which you can control it with your fingers. It uses face detection to detect a user’s face, lock onto it and fly according to how the user’s fingers are moving.         Even though the DJI Spark has a relatively smaller footprint, it has a maximum ascent and descent speed of 3 m/s. Turn on the Sport Mode and you can fly it with speed as high as 50 kph. DJI claims that this drone can fly for around 16 minutes with its 1,480 mAh battery, although the real-life scenario might differ.

Daraz Online Shopping is throwing off a flat  11% discount  on the OnePlus 5 as a Black Friday Deal making the phone Rs.52,990 from Rs.59,990.

It offers the latest Snapdragon 835 processor coupled with insane 6GB of RAM. The combo will be more than enough for everything related to heavy gaming and multitasking. The 5.5-inch Optic AMOLED display may not stand up against the flagships like  Samsung S8  and  Note 8  but it is still sharp and provides a good viewing experience.         On the camera department, the phone is still viable offering dual camera set up in a pair of 16+20MP. The assisting camera helps for 1.6x optical zoom. It can also shoot 4K @30fps which is great for a phone at this price. For storing all of your high-end photos, apps, and contents, it offers 64GB of storage which should be plenty enough. With no option for expansion, relying on Google Photos could be an alternative.  The Black Friday Deals at Daraz starts from 12 Midnight Nov 24.

It was introduced in 2016 and had taken up a niche market since its launch. Rumors follow that the firm was planning this move from early August this year and that the upcoming iPhone SE2 will be using the A10 chip that is used in iPhone 7. The device is rumored to launch in the first quarter of next year. Along with the A10 chipset, it is said that iPhone SE2 will be using the iOS 11 operating system.  The iPhone SE2 will surely cost less than larger iPhones.  Reports affirm that the specs of this upcoming device will be the same as the last one; variations will be brought about in the storage capacity (32GB and 128GB). Nonetheless, the phone may have a slightly larger screen measuring 4-4.2 inches.         Sources also reveal that the iPhone SE2 is to start selling in the Indian market first before actually being shipped to other markets with a hope to penetrate deeply into the Indian market. Apple is working hard to establish the iPhone market in India and has committed more energy and money to be able to do so. Further, it seems that the company is trying to make India ‘the next China’ for itself.  Apple is all set to start productions in India and is in talks with the Bangalore and Karnataka government to acquire land and triple its capacity for a new production line.  The iPhone SE has same the performance as the iPhone 6S and delivers amazing battery improvements, which was priced at $399 only.  While there is very less known about the new iPhone SE, it can certainly ignite enthusiasm among its existing user base and may even attract other users, which of course is what the company aims.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/iphone-se-gbn.jpeg']

It has a flexible neck design which is twistable, up to 180 degrees. It also connects to Bixby for a digital personal assistant on the go.

"['Motorola Moto C Plus Review: Worth it or not for 13,999?']","['Lenovo', 'Motorola', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['November 22, 2017']",2017-11-22 14:58:58+00:00,"['Motorola, an American multinational telecommunications company and the\xa0first mobile company to make handheld phones, has established itself all across the globe for its build quality and has recently stepped into the Nepali market on October 24, 2017 after an analysis of the ever-growing smartphone market here. \xa0 LifeCom\xa0Pvt. Ltd. \xa0has been appointed as the sole authorized distributor of  Motorola Mobiles in Nepal  has brought budget-oriented Moto C-series and  Moto E-series  smartphones here in the country.  I got to play around with the Moto C Plus and test its specifications for a few days after the official launch. The phone priced at Rs. 13,990 seems to have set foot in the country with the aim of giving a competition to the budget-oriented smartphones in the market. Before moving on to the review, let’s take a look at what the phone has up for offer:         Key Specifications of Moto C Plus   5-inch (1280 x 720 pixels) HD TDT LCD display  1.3GHz quad-core 64-bit MediaTek processor (MT6737)  2GB RAM, 16GB internal memory, expandable memory with microSD  Dual SIM with 4G  Android 7.0 (Nougat)  8MP rear camera with f/2.2 aperture, LED Flash  2MP front-facing camera with f/2.8 aperture, LED flash  4000mAh battery  Price: Rs.13,990   Build and Design:  My first impression of the Moto C Plus, hands down, was that the phone looked bulky. The plastic build of the phone is also questionable because similar range phones from Xiaomi and others offer metallic build. The phone is a bit chunky and also quite thick.   There is metal-like ring around the front face of the phone that has no functionality whatsoever and is actually made up of plastic. That made the phone look somehow tacky and I personally think the phone would have been better off without it.   However, even if there isn’t much to say about the traditional build of the phone, it sure has been built very well and feels extremely solid. The curves and the micro-textured back of the phone a nice grip and finish to the phone.  Display:  The C Plus has a 5-inch HD TFT, scratch-resistant display with a pixel density of 294 PPI. Even if there is not an auto-brightness feature, the minimum brightness is suitable enough for night time usage. However, the maximum brightness seems questionable and somehow inadequate to deal with bright sunlight. This was quite bothersome. Also, I found the touch responses to be a bit slow at times. I had to keep repeating the same actions over and over again to make the phone respond.   On the brighter side, the colors are natural and accurate. And the display’s resolution is good enough, if not exemplary. All in all, the display of the Moto C Plus is good enough for the price range.  Performance:  The device is powered by MediaTek MT6737 chipset, which features a quad-core processor clocked at 1.3GHz. For graphics support, the phone comes with Mali-T720MP2 GPU. In terms of memory, the Moto C Plus incorporates 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 32GB via SDcard.  With features like app drawer and split window, running multiple apps and toggling between them was never a hassle. The phone does not have much screen space to offer but these features worked smoothly here. Also, running lighter games like: Color Switch, Tap the Frog and so forth was seamless. To test how the phone worked on running heavier games, I played Asphalt 8 on the phone, and the result was a bit disappointing as the game lagged a lot and even caused the phone to heat up pretty quickly. So the performance is just good enough and there isn’t much to explore. While similar range phones from other manufacturers (like  Xiaomi ) have already shifted to the more powerful\xa0Snapdragon 425 processor, the MediaTek chipset that this offers seems inadequate.  Software:  The Moto C Plus runs on Android 7.0 Nougat and comes with the latest stock Android.\xa0This is one of the most attractive features of the phone. Also, there is no bloat here and unwanted applications are also absent in this skin, which has helped to optimize the performance of the phone. The few touch-ups that Motorola has done on the Stock Android makes the UI experience very refreshing.   Another thing that I noticed here was that the phone does not have a default music player app. Hence, I had to download one immediately after I got the phone.  The UI elements here are completely bloat-free and hence they offer smooth usability to the users. However, this phone does not come with the\xa0‘Moto’ app that is available in the higher priced phones from the company and hence, the smart motion gestures are unavailable here. Also, a few of the budget smartphones like the Colors P85+ Selfie Pro, Xiaomi Redmi 4 and so forth have fingerprint sensor in them, but this does not have one.  Hardware:  The volume and power buttons are placed on the left side of the phone. And due to the small length of the body, I could easily access these buttons. The navigation buttons are present at the bottom of the front panel.   The phone houses a USB 2.0 charging port at the top along with the 3.5 mm headphone jack port.   The phone features a really powerful speaker at the back which emitted good sound even at high volume, which was surprisingly nice.   Camera:  The phone features an 8 MP rear camera with an aperture of f/2.2, auto-focus and LED flash. On the front, the phone houses a 2 MP camera with an aperture of f/2.8 that also comes with LED flash. The camera here is very minimalist as it does not offer any specific photography modes and settings.   Upon ample lighting in outdoor situations, the rear camera delivers an okay performance. Outdoor shots with proper lighting are sharp and have natural colors but sometimes appear to have an yellowish tint to them. One thing that I liked about the phone is that the sensor in the rear camera fastens focus very quickly onto the subjects.   Also, the front camera does not have much for offer, besides the front flash. But, similar range phones from other brands have such exemplary camera performance, comparing the Moto C Plus with them in terms of photography does not even seem possible in many ways. The pictures taken from the front camera of the Moto C Plus are barely Social Media worthy.  The low light camera performance is nothing more than a struggle here. The pictures do not offer any clarity, if at all and are very noisy and pixelated. The front flash only helps to provide some lighting for the pictures but the pictures are still blurry.  Battery:  The battery is the star of this phone. Backed by a massive 4000mAh battery, the phone provides almost over 5 hours of on screen time. During the few days that I used the phone as my daily driver, it lasted me well the whole day after a full charge and also had at least 20-25 percentage still left by the end of the day. There is also an inbuilt battery saver mode in the phone that saves the battery once that the charge hits 20% mark. I only had to enable the battery-saver mode once during my time with the phone.   An additional wow factor in terms of the battery here is the fast charging functionality. However, the phone does not come with a charger compatible with this feature. It took me almost a little over two hours to completely charge the phone from level 0.  Verdict:  As the final verdict for my experience with the Moto C Plus, I must say that the phone is a stealer in terms of battery back up and the Stock Android UI experience, but the other features of the phone are not much of an attraction. When the market is already brimming with smartphones with sleeker designs and better performance features, this phone certainly has some tough competition.  Certainly, the battery back up is really commendable here. But the lags in the performance foreground and camera department cannot be easily overlooked. The bulky build might also be a liability here.  Pros: What I liked about the Moto C Plus\xa0   The powerful 4000mAh battery.  The Stock Android UI.  The budget.   Cons: What could have been better in the Moto C Plus   The chipset.  Camera performance.  A slimmer and lighter build.   What is your say about the Moto C Plus?

And choosing a game out of all those triple-A titles might be a hard one. So we are here to help you with a list of five most “fun” games according to us (your preferences may vary).  PUGB (PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS)  This is an awesome game from Bluehole, Inc. It’s still in its early access stage, but with more than a million players at any given moment, this game is no joke. Plus, it’s mad fun to just play around. You basically fall into this map from an airplane along with some 90-95 other players with basically one objective.  Be the last man surviving!  Just think of “Hunger Games”, this game is almost exactly the same. You can also make a group of up to\xa0four friends and team up.         You can buy the game from  STEAM , they are currently giving you a hefty discount. Also, note that this game is in its early unoptimized stages, so make sure you have more than enough horsepower to reach the 60fps mark. Most probably a GTX 1060, you can buy this game from  here .  FIFA 18  Fifa 18 is hands down one of the all-time favorites for the football lovers. You can also opt for PES 18 if that’s your thing. Either way, I can’t think of a better game for a virtual football game than this. In general, there are 22 players on the pitch, and you try to…….Do we really need to explain football now? You would be happy to hear about the new “Journey” mode where you play as Hunter, and the improvements in the Carrier modes as well.   You can buy the game from  Origin ,  here  is a link to the game.  Battlefield 1  Battlefield has always been one of the best First Person Shooters (FPS) games in the business, and Battlefield 1 takes it to a whole another level. It’s the second game in our list developed by\xa0EA DICE. Basically, this game takes place in the various scenarios from the World War 1. You play as a bunch of characters with their own stories. Every character has their own objectives, backstory, which makes every character special. This game is all about the storyline. Although, saying more about this game would be a spoiler, so you should give this game a try yourself.   You can buy it from  here .  Tom Clancy’s The Division  Tom Clancy’s The Division is a Third Person Shooter developed by UBISOFT. This game delivers\xa0really good graphics, along with a decent gameplay experience. The game itself takes place in a world where the society that we live in now has fallen apart, due to a devastating pandemic sweep or something. What you have to do is fight for a better tomorrow.   You can buy the game from  here .  Need For Speed Payback  Need For Speed is a game that needs no introduction. Developed by Ghost games and EA sports, this game has been one of the most famous car racing games ever. The game takes place in an open world environment. You get three playable characters, with focus on “Action Driving”.   You can buy the game from  here .']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pc-master-race.jpg']

The budget offerings from Nokia were good but they were just run of the mill. We all have been waiting for the  Nokia 8 , the Big Daddy of Nokia phones and it’s now finally available for Pre-Booking in Nepal via Daraz Kaymu.  Prebooking Information:  >  Booking Period:  20th – 30th November 2017 >  Phones Availability:  7th December 2017 >  Black Friday Deal:  To be revealed on 24th Nov 2017 (Friday) >  Color:  Glossy Blue  Also Read:  Nokia Mobiles Price in Nepal        Nokia 8 comes with a similar form factor like the Nokia 5 but it much more premium with the use of polished unibody 6000 series aluminum. This also provides the rigidity to the device as it’s what Nokia’s known for. Like the Nokia 5, it has incorporated fingerprint sensor on the home button. The phone\xa0comes with a 5.3-inch 2K display with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for protection against drops and scratches. The phone is also IP54 splash resistant. It also offers the Always on Display widely popular on Samsung and Motorola phones. Despite all it has to offer, the display in today’s standard seems outdated with no 18:9 aspect ratio and comparatively big bezels.   Powering the phone is the latest Snapdragon 835 chipset coupled with 4GB or 6GB of RAM. In terms of performance, it is on par with every flagship out there today. The stock Android experience may even make it smoother. It is running on Android 7.1.2 Nougat with Oreo update on the pipeline. The Nokia 8 offered for Pre-Booking is a base model. It sports 64GB storage coupled with the 4GB of RAM. The storage can be expanded up to 256GB using the SIM 2 slot.   The camera is where Nokia phones had kept their mark in the past and they tend to do so with the Nokia 8. It comes with  dual camera setup  on the back with a 13+13MP pair. The primary 13MP camera comprises of RGB sensor while the secondary 13MP holds the monochrome sensor. The assisting camera helps to attain more details and depth. This combo results in highly detailed images, great Black and White photos and amazing bokeh effect. It can also shoot 4K videos at 30fs with  Optical Image Stabilization . The phone also comes with Dual Sight mode which opens the back and the front camera at the same time. It can be proven beneficial for Facebook or Instagram Live. Up front, it is equipped with the same 13MP primary sensor as in the back. So, the front camera is likely to be superior compared to others. It can also shoot 4K@30fps and has PDAF. To add up, Nokia 8 is the first phone in the world to sport OZO spatial 360 audio. It will result in more lively sound and provides better audio quality while capturing videos.  The Nokia 8 comes with USB Type C and luckily a headphone jack as well. It is backed up by 3090mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0.

"['Xiaomi Square Box 2: Cheap, loud and long lasting portable speaker']",['Reviews'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['November 19, 2017']",2017-11-19 14:50:57+00:00,"['Your music experience depends on the speakers you use. And when you are in a group, the tinny speakers on your phone just won’t cut it. The only reasonable and viable alternative is a portable speaker, preferably one that’s loud and has a long battery life.  The Xiaomi Square Box 2 is a Bluetooth speaker that ticks both of these boxes. With a battery that lasts more than 6 hours and a portable lightweight body, is this the best Bluetooth speaker? Nope, not even close, but considering it’s price, you will not regret it.         Body  The Square Box 2 has an aluminum body with the exception of the front and back, those are plastic. Although the speaker did not feel quite good in the hand, with sharp and uncomfortable edges, most users probably won’t even notice it anyway. It is a sturdy device nevertheless.   The top of the speaker has three buttons for input. The power button doubles as a call receiver, and with a built-in mic, you can pick calls-up without touching your phone. The volume buttons also double as a music navigator.   The back of the speaker has two ports, one a 3.5mm audio jack, and a micro USB for power. The front is filled with speaker grills and finally, the bottom has two rubber feet for vibration control. It’s a relatively\xa0minimal design compared to some flashy portable speakers out there.  Sound Quality  The sound quality is pretty decent, considering a price tag of $28, I didn’t hope for much. It was pretty loud for its size, although the bass on those two 2.5W speakers did disappoint me. This is definitely not one for music enthusiasts or serious listeners but for casual users, this will be more than enough. Moreover, even at high volumes, there is very less distortion. Other speakers at this price point did perform similarly, with some bass heavy and some really loud, this particular one is decently loud and lightweight.  Connectivity  Connectivity can be done through two ways, a 3.5mm headphone jack or Bluetooth 4.2. This speaker connects to your phone really fast, not Bluetooth 5.0 fast but it’s pretty fast. The range is also quite decent, you won’t have any problems unless you have a really big room.   Battery Life  The speaker has a 1200mAh battery that, according to the website delivers 10 hours of continuous playback at 40% volume. I usually got more than 6 hours of music playback, video watching and game plays at mixed volumes. I personally didn’t find any problems with the battery backup on this. And when you do run out of battery, you can fully charge it within 3 hours.  Conclusion  All in all, this is a good speaker for casual users. But in any case you have more budget than the cost of this speaker, I recommend you go for some other speaker like the  audio cube , which won’t be as portable but will deliver immensely better sound quality. You can also buy one from Xiaomi itself, the  Mi Bluetooth Speaker , which costs around 2k more but the improvement in sound quality is definitely worth it.  If you are looking for a cheap, portable, long lasting and loud Bluetooth speaker, this one is for you. You can buy the Square Box 2 from  banggood.com . If you want one, you can buy it  here . They do ship to Nepal at a really low shipping cost and are also pretty reliable.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_0060.jpg']

This is the fastest car to ever enter production, and that is counting the cars that run on electricity and petroleum products according to the figures showcased by Elon Musk.  According to Elon Musk, the car can go from 0 to 60mph in a staggering 1.9 seconds, and 0 to 100mph in 4.2 seconds. Another crazy figure based on the Tesla Roadster 2.0 is it can do a quarter of a mile in 8.9 seconds.  “This is the base model!”  -Elon musk   Talking more about the car, it has a top speed of over 250mph, and if all this isn’t insane enough for you, I don’t know what is.         Powering all of these figures is a 200kWh battery which, according to Tesla, will offer a range of 630 miles. They did state that the range was for highways so regular driving miles will differ.  “The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline vehicles.”  The Tesla Roadster 2.0 is a two by two four-seater, with a torque of 10,000Nm that will cost you a sweet $200,000. The first 1,000 buyers will get the Founder’s series that will cost them a cool $250,000, a $50,000 premium.  The price will feel like a bargain when you think that this is the fastest production car as of now. Tesla also gave people in the crowd a chance to test ride it if they put a $50,000 deposit.  The Roadster will be available for purchase by 2020. With more than one world-record shattered, this was an eventful night. Also, with the name Roadster comes a convertible roof, not a traditional one but still.  Alongside the second-generation Tesla Roadster, Tesla also released a Semi Truck. This one has a range of 500 miles, looks like Darth Vader, engineered to be aerodynamic, and has 18 wheels. Elon Musk also promised self-driving abilities.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TESLA-ROADSTER.jpg']

Buy Nokia 2 Here   Right off the bat, the phone comes with a 5-inch 720p panel which is standard for a  sub 15K phone . To my surprise, the display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 making it less prone to cracks and scratches. For added durability, it comes with a 6000 series aluminum frame giving it a robust body. The back, however, is made out of polycarbonate. The design is similar to the  Nokia 3  or the  Nokia 5 . But you’ll find the phone in two-tone colors giving a fun vibe to it.         Performance is where the phone falls back. It is powered by an old Snapdragon 212 Processor clocked at 1.3GHz coupled with 1GB of RAM. For storage, 8GB of memory is available which can be expanded up to 128GB using microSD card. The weak chipsets are aided with the Stock Android which should provide a decent experience. It is running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and will soon be receiving the Oreo Update. Android 8.0 introduces Android GO which optimizes android for phones with low hardware specifications. This will certainly bring more life to the phone later on.   On the optics side of things, it sports an 8MP rear Camera with autofocus and 5MP Front Facing Camera. The rear can shoot 720p videos.

['Official: OnePlus 5T with a bigger display and better cameras unveiled!'],['OnePlus'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['November 17, 2017']",2017-11-17 04:54:05+00:00,"['Amidst the hoard of all smartphone giants competing to create a mark for themselves with almost completely bezel-free designs, OnePlus: the Chinese smartphone marker, has also put forward a new product to add to the pile. In a LIVE event broadcast yesterday on 16th November 2017, the company unveiled the OnePlus 5T. It is also now available in Nepali market. The 64GB version costs Rs.64,900 and the 128GB version costs Rs. 72,900 in Nepal.  Earlier in 2016, the company had launched OnePlus 3 and then in the latter half of the year, OnePlus 3T was launched. Similarly, after the launch of OnePlus 5 in June 2017, the company made similar strategies like last year and launched the OnePlus 5T. With more attractive specs, OnePlus 5T seems to have set a new checkpoint for all smartphones. Without further ado, I would now like to walk you through the features of the latest release.         The first thing that everyone would notice about the OnePlus 5T is the 6-inch full Optic AMOLED display with\xa018:9 aspect ratio display. This is also an upgrade compared to the OnePlus 5 which had 16:9 aspect ratio. But the thing to note here is that the form factor of the phone is still the same. The new aspect ratio is one of the primary specs of the OP 5T that guards it from other counterparts. The phone offers 1080P (1080 x 2160 pixels) resolution with 401ppi pixel density. Enabled with display features like sRGB and DCI-P3, the phone is all set to provide a better viewing experience to the users. The newer sunlight display feature enabled in this phone adjusts the display features according to the ambient light settings.  To make sure that the display stays immersive and offers the best of all available screen space, the manufacturers have also moved the fingerprint scanner to the back. The scanner unlocks the phone in 0.2 seconds and also incorporates gesture control,\xa0such as swiping to bring down the notification and quick settings dropdown and holding it to trigger the camera shutter when taking a selfie. The placement has also been done well, so this transition feels really smooth. Speaking of scanners, the OP 5T comes with a new feature: face unlock which is the fastest facial recognition on any smartphone (unlocks in 0.4 seconds). With over 100 facial identifiers, the face unlock can unlock the phone even when you are wearing a scarf or making a funny face. And safety is a primary concern, this feature does not work with sensitive apps: like payment app and so forth.  Moving on to the design of the phone, the OnePlus 5T has a seamless all metal chassis that ensure that the phone is slim, comfortable, easy to hold and also durable. The arced design of the phone makes it more ergonomic and flexible. Also, the manufacturers have brought back the horizon line: a continuous hard edge that emphasizes strength and agility by dividing the phone body into two halves: one casting light and the other one in shadow for a stunning effect. There is also an alert slider that is very easy to adjust – one doesn’t have to even pick up the phone for it. Users will be able to put their phones in three notification profiles:   Ring: To receive all calls  Do not disturb: To receive priority calls only  Silent: To mute all notifications and focus elsewhere   Another crowd cheered at the launch event was the availability of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. Though the USB type C accessories are making a name for themselves in the market, a majority of the general public is still very much in love with the 3.5 mm audio jack. The cheering crowd at the event was also an indicator for this.   Moving on to the camera department of the phone, the manufacturers claimed to have one of the best dual camera settings. Based on user preferences, the company has taken note to develop two key aspects of the dual rear cameras: low light performance and portraits. The main camera is 16MP with\xa0f/1.7 aperture and the secondary camera has been optimized for better low light performance allowing users to take clearer pictures in low light conditions. The 20 MP secondary camera, now comes with 27.22mm focal length and\xa0f/1.7 aperture. The secondary lens comes with\xa0Intelligent Pixel Technology which automatically\xa0groups pixels together in order for the original sensor to capture enough light and dark data, hence, enhancing the low light performance. Serious improvements have also been made here to make sure that portraits come clear and sharp. The front houses a 16MP camera with\xa0f/2.0 aperture.  The OnePlus 5T is still running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat with OxygenOS on top.\xa0Oreo has been available to the public since late August, and to see a new phone released in November with Android Nougat is a bit depressing.\xa0Display options like Night Mode and Reading Mode, that were also available on the OP 5, the revamped underlays of the OxygenOS in the OnePlus 5T are laudable. The changes OnePlus made to OxygenOS are welcome, such as its scalable Slate font to improve the viewing experience. However, the fact that an older Android version is just what the latest release has up for the offer, has raised some concerns for those who are a fan of\xa0Android updates.   The Snapdragon 835 processor with Adreno 540 graphics are the same as of its predecessor, and so are the two storage and RAM options: users can pick between 6GB of RAM with 64GB of storage or 8GB of RAM with 128GB of space.\xa0Backed by 3,300mAh battery, the OP 5T also come with the proprietary Dash Charge fast-charging technology. However, some latest techs like fast charging and waterproofing are still unavailable here.  Specifications of OnePlus 5T:   6.01 inches full Optic AMOLED display with\xa01080P resolution, 401ppi  18:9\xa0Aspect Ratio with 2.5D Corning® Gorilla® Glass 5  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Octa-core Processor clocked at 2.45GHz  6/8 GB RAM, 64/128 GB Internal memory  OxygenOS based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat  Dual nano-SIM slot  16 MP primary rear camera, 20 MP secondary sensor with\xa0Intelligent Pixel Technology  16 MP front camera with f/2.0 aperture  Fingerprint, Hall, Accelerometer, G-sensor, Electronic Compass, Gyroscope, Proximity, Ambient Light Sensor, RGB, Sensor Hub  USB 2.0, Type-C, Supports USB Audio, 3.5mm audio jack  Dimensions:\xa01156.1*75*7.3mm; Weight: 162g  3,300 mAh (non-removable), Dash Charge (5V 4A) Dash Charge (5V 4A)   One Plus 5T Price in Nepal:  iHub, the sole authorized distributor of One Plus products in Nepal, has launched the One Plus 5T in Nepal for a slightly exorbitant pricing. The company has priced the Oneplus 5T at Rs. 64,900 for the 6GB/64GB version and Rs.72,900 for the 8GB/128GB version.  A quick trivia here:  Fans of OnePlus had the\xa0opportunity to see the unveiling live in person upon paying $40 for a ticket. The attendees did not only get a\xa0swag bag with lots of goodies inside, they also got a $40 off coupon for the OnePlus 5T. Moreover, the ticket proceedings from the launch event will be used to fund F-Droid: a software repository that acts as an alternative to the Google Play Store but only accepts free and open-source software (FOSS).

Another key factor in both of these models is that they come with a glass back that supports wireless charging. Fast charging mode is also supported on them but one will have to buy a special fast-charging adapter:  Apple’s $49 29W USB-C  along with a $25 USB-C-to-Lightning power cable. However,  much cannot be said about the design and build of these two models as they have pretty outdated designs.   However, the catch here is that it has been quite some time since these products were released in the global market. Also, Apple has already released it’s the latest offering: iPhone X which lies on the expensive side of the scale ($999 for the 64GB model and $1,149 for 256GB) but also has topped the game of iPhones that have been released till date. So now, will you go for iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus or wait for the iPhone X to hit the floors?

['Motorola Moto E4 Plus Review: Big-time Battery Boost on Budget'],"['Motorola', 'Reviews']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['November 16, 2017']",2017-11-16 11:43:41+00:00,"['Recently,  Motorola surfaced in the Nepali smartphone market  with four smartphones in their lineup.  Moto E4 Plus  was one of the four smartphones launched, which is priced at Rs.20,990. With so many smartphone brands already available in Nepal and the multitude of smartphones in their lineup, choosing a decent smartphone had always been a stressful task. But will the presence of Moto E4 Plus ease the hunt for a good smartphone available at Rs.20,000? Let’s find out in this review.   Moto E4 Plus Specs   Display : 5.5-inch (1280 x 720 pixels) HD IPS LCD display, 2.5D curved glass, Gorilla Glass 3 Protection, Oleophobic Coating  Processor : 64 bit, Quad-core CPU, 1.3 GHz clock speed  Chipset :\xa0MediaTek MT6737  GPU : Mali-T720  RAM :\xa03GB  Memory : 32GB internal memory, expandable with microSD (Dedicated Slot)  OS :\xa0Android 7.1.1 (Nougat)  Dimensions :\xa0155 x 77.5 x 9.6 mm;  Weight : 198g  Rear Camera : 13MP, f/2.0 aperture, 1.12 µm pixel size, autofocus, LED Flash  Front Camera : 5MP, f/2.2 aperture, 1.4 µm pixel size, LED flash  Sensors :\xa0Fingerprint (front-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, ambient light sensor  Connectivity : Dual SIM (4G + 2G), Bluetooth 4.2,\xa0Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, A-GPS, MicroUSB 2.0  Battery : 5000mAh built-in battery with Fast Charging (5V/2A)  Moto E4 Plus Price in Nepal: \xa0Rs.20,990   Build and Design  Though sheathed inside a plastic body, the E4 Plus resembles a metallic fitting and also offers a premium feel to its users. However, the device is relatively heavy with 198g of weight and may discomfort the people who are used to with light smartphones. The phone has big bezels on the top and the bottom. Despite having thick bezels on the chin, the phone opted for on-screen buttons, which is so unpersuasive.         As for the buttons, the device includes a power button and volume rockers on the right with an added texture to the power button. There is also a notification LED on top bezel of the device, which seems to work only during charging or battery low condition. For charging, microUSB 2.0 port lies on the bottom alongside the speaker grills.   The phone also has a port for 3.5mm headphone jack, which resides on the top. The back cover of the device is removable, where is there is two SIM card slots and a dedicated slot for SDcard.  For securing the smartphone and to evade data vulnerabilities, there is a front mounted fingerprint sensor on the device. The fingerprint sensor is pretty sensitive and can be used for both locking and unlocking the device. However, only registered fingerprints can be employed for unlocking the device whereas any fingerprint is capable of locking it.   Other sensors on the device are proximity sensor, ambient light sensor and accelerometer with an absolute absence of the Gyro sensor.   Display  E4 Plus is provided with 5.5-inch IPS LCD display, which features 720p resolution. The viewing angle is fairly decent with good amount of color reproduction. The display on the device also looks seamless and elegant with 2.5D glass. In addition, with Gorilla Glass 3, the display is less prone to scratches.   Although oleophobic coating is provided to the display, it fails to keep aside the fingerprint smudges most of the time. The smooth coating has made the display rather slippery.  Camera  In terms of camera, the device sports 13MP sensor on the back and a 5MP sensor on the front and LED flash accompanies them both.   Under ample lighting condition, the back camera takes impressive shots with plenty of details.   But sometimes the images seem to lack dynamic range and color vibrancy. Under such scenario, turning on the HDR mode helps usually. While shooting in the night time or low-light scenario, the images suffer from noises and grains.   The selfie shooter is not disappointing either. One can pull out social media ready selfies from the front shooter. However, the beauty mode does not seem up to the mark.   With the beauty mode on the play, the skin is over smoothened in the name of making it beautiful. And the subject seems to lose their natural aura at times. Also the camera UI lacks manual or pro mode through which user could tweak the ISO, exposure, shutter speed, etc.  Performance  E4 Plus is powered by an average MediaTek MT6737 chipset aided by 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. The device runs smoothly on running light apps and games and multitasking with them. However, with heavy and graphics demanding apps and games, stutters and drop in frame rate are inevitable. The device also froze at times showing the inability to operate the tasks assigned.        1  of 3                                                Software  The device comes with Android Nougat out of the box. The User Interface on the device is close to the stock Android with just Dolby Atmos and Moto app as the additions. With the Moto app, the users can replace the on-screen buttons with gestures through the fingerprint sensor.   Moto app has bluelight filter option for eye-protection and also has a mode to shrink the screen size for the single-handed use. It also has the Moto display mode, which when turned on wakes the screen showing date, time and notifications just on lifting the device or shifting its position. On the other hand, the Dolby Atmos app lets the user tweak the equalizer so that the user can get the sound output matching their taste.  Battery  The massive 5000mAh battery is the USP of the phone. On the heavy use, the massive battery keeps the device alive untiringly for 8-9 hours. On the normal use, it provides two days backup. There is also an optimization mode through which the backup time can be pushed further. Although the device supports fast charging, it takes around 3 hours for the battery replenishment from 0-100% with the proprietary charger.   Verdict  If a long-life battery tops your list of phone needs, then E4 Plus would be a wise choice under Rs.20,000. It offers a big screen with scratch resistant and water repellent coating, decent camera, fast fingerprint sensor, dedicated SDcard slot and bloatware free OS as the additional benefits. However, the bulk body, low 720p resolution, sluggish processor and the absence of gyrosensor may turn you off a little.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Moto-E4-Plus-price-in-Nepal-Moto-E4-Plus-Review.jpg']
['Where is the Smart Cars industry headed to in 2017?'],['smart cars'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['November 16, 2017']",2017-11-16 10:34:13+00:00,"['Cars – some love them, some hate them. A cheesy way to start a story, I know. For a normal layman, there are basically three types of cars: one that runs on battery, another on fuel and a few of those hybrids. But the statement “this world will run out of fuel in the next 50 years” is where it gets a little scary.  Let’s talk about smart cars now. Smart cars are the cars that, in a simple sense, have a brain. There is a set of sensors, a smart & powerful CPU, and a few other goodies enabling it to do a set of functions on its own. Smart cars have been around for some time now, and right about now, we are finally in the transaction phase.  A bunch of huge car companies are on board to launch smart cars and the Government approval is really close,. The cars’ technology is almost complete and electric car batteries are getting better. More importantly, the general public seems to be on board and excited.\xa0In such a life-altering phase, let’s look at some of the most interesting stories in the field of smart cars.        Roborace  Firstly, Roborace car is “ the world’s first electric driverless racing car “. Looking at it through the eyes of a tech enthusiast, these cars don’t just drive, they rather race without the need of a human racer. Two Roborace can even race each other, one AI vs another.  But, is it something you want? Look at of it in this way: think of a reason you love the sport of racing. You probably like those vehicles, the race tracks, or the environment, but what makes it all tick are the racers. If you take the racer out of the equation it probably won’t\xa0be as fun or emotional as before. We love the spat, the connection with the racer, the friendship, the freedom of error and more importantly the love and hate they\xa0get. And that is the same reason I can’t see myself watching a race between AIs.  Leaving the ethics and wants aside, this is, however, a huge step forward in the field of smart cars. Also, Nvidia is a partner in the Roborace project. There is still a few years left for the completion of this project, but if you want to know more about Roborace, you can visit its  official website .  Toyota’s Self-Driving Car  Toyota’s new prototype of a self-driving car is complete. All Toyota need to wow, is to prove that it works. The company will surely put it through a series set of tests.  GoMentum\xa0Station, a dedicated car testing company is set to perform those tests. This technology is still in its early phases so don’t expect Toyota to start taking pre-orders anytime time soon.  Honda Sports EV concept  The Honda Sports EV is just a concept from Honda. Honda says that this car will bring the driver and the car even closer together. But for one, the production might start in 2019 or by 2021.      Credits: Top Gear                  A feeling of joy and emotional unity to the drive  The power and performance of this car aren’t revealed yet, all we know is it’s completely electric and looks great. The car will also feature its own version of AI that will react to its driver’s reactions and emotions. It will also support voice commands and a few assistive driving technologies.  UK’s guidelines for smart car cybersecurity  We know smart cars are cars with a software, so basically, it could and is vulnerable. If you don’t get why cars need cybersecurity, then you can think of an instance where your car is on auto mode and someone hijacks it from a computer and drives you out of a cliff. Not really an exact representation but at least you get it.  allow innovation to flourish and ensure the next wave of self-driving technology is invented, designed and operated safely in the UK  So why the UK? Well, they have one of the biggest numbers of smart cars on the road. The exact words were\xa0“all parties involved in the manufacturing and supply chain … with a consistent set of guidelines.” The guidelines consist of 8 basic principles   Organizations should ensure that security is a priority on a board level  Manufacturers should assess potential risks especially with third-party contractors  Vehicle security needs to last for the lifetime of the system in question  Organizations and subcontractors must work together to certify their security processes and products  Security systems should be made redundant  Manufactures should manage software over the expected life of the system  Data storage should be secure  The vehicle or systems should be able to withstand attacks and continue to function   We are sure the cars that are currently queued for production will follow these guidelines. The problem lies with the older smart cars, will they be left vulnerable?  Samsung’s $8 billion investment on smart cars  The high demand for advanced driver assistance systems [ADAS] has brought the smartphone maker Samsung into the field of smart cars. Samsung is known to bud in on almost every booming sector possible and it seems like smart cars are also a target for the company.  Samsung wants in on the action, and is happy to put its money where its mouth is  Samsung’s recently acquired Harman International for around $8 billion.\xa0Harman International Industries has been fiddling around in the smart car business. They basically design and engineer connected products for automakers, consumers, and enterprises worldwide, including connected car systems, audio and visual products, enterprise automation, and connected services. They will be working closely with Samsung to develop safer, smarter and connected vehicles.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SMART-CARS.jpg']

The Galaxy S9 mini accompanies its bigger brother, the regular Galaxy S9. And both of them are going to launch alongside the even bigger Galaxy S9+.  Remember the days when Samsung used to launch just one Galaxy S smartphone in a year? Well, next year it’s going to be three S-series smartphones. That’s probably because people want devices of different screen sizes and Samsung\xa0wants to make the best of this.  All three Galaxy S9 variants will feature an even better AMOLED displays. No doubts there. It seems like Samsung is sticking with their 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The new devices will also be the first to get Qualcomm’s latest and greatest for next year – the  Snapdragon 845  chipset.        People who like smaller displays will be happy to hear that the Samsung Galaxy S9 mini, will feature a 5-inch edge to edge display with the same 18.5:9 screen ratio. Let’s just hope that Samsung doesn’t compromise on the internals of this device.  The fingerprint will find it’s way to the back of the phone, below the camera sensors. There are also talks of a proper facial recognition like  face ID , and a dual camera setup as well. Sensibly, the RAM will be well over the 6GB mark, with the exception of the S9 mini (most probably 4GB). There is one claim that is too unreal to pan out – a 1000 fps slow-mo capable camera sensor. We will have to wait and see which of this rumor actually pans out.  All of these devices in question are set to launch together in March 2018. The pricing, on the other hand, will be tricky since a smaller version is launching as well. Without much of a design change, the prices will probably not be different from the current versions.

The state-owned telecommunication company has easily accumulated 59% of the total votes. This is the first time we have seen an option garner more than 50% of the votes. However, it only had a few competitors.         Ncell took the second spot, probably a result of its changing owners and the tax issues. Also, its high tariff\xa0rates don’t help much either. They really need to learn that Nepali people want cheaper rates on calls and texts rather than the features that no one uses.  The option “all of them suck” came third with a total of 16% votes. If we consider the number of people who hate the telecommunication service every now and then, this 16% is actually surprising.  The mere 4% that “others” got is a negative\xa0for the industry.

Previously only seen on flagships like the Samsung S8’s and Note 8, this feature is quickly shifting towards midrange devices.  Huawei Nova 2i  is the only mid-range phone apart from the  Oppo F5  in Nepal to sport this aspect ratio. Not only that, it is also the first phone in Nepal to sport 4 cameras.  Huawei Nova 2i comes with a 5.9-inch Full HD+ display with the new 18:9 aspect ratio and a staggering 83% body to screen ratio. With almost borderless design, Huawei calls it the FullView display. The tall form factor is the new standard in mobile displays and we’ll see it in newer devices to come. It will help to incorporate more contents on the display and with near bezel-less design, will create an immersive experience. Right now, there aren’t videos, apps and other contents that will fit well into this panel but in the coming days, most of them will adapt to it.         For performance, the Huawei Nova 2i is rocking the in-house Kirin 659 octa-core chipset clocked at a\xa0maximum frequency of 2.36Ghz with adaptive AI technology. With adaptive AI, the device will be able to track your usage patterns for optimizing those processes and also aids in intelligently boosting the performance of the device.  The Nova 2i comes coupled with 4GB of RAM. It has a single variant with 64GB memory onboard which can be expandable up to 256GB trading off the 2nd SIM. With no space up front, the fingerprint sensor is placed on the back. Huawei Nova 2i is running on Android 7.0 with EMUI 5.1 on top. The phone fails to incorporate the USB Type C port. The phone also lacks fast charging capability for its 3340mAh battery.  The feature highlight of the phone is its quad camera, two on the front and the rest on the back. The back houses dual cameras in a pair of 16+2MP sensors. On the front, it holds a pair of 13+2MP sensors. The dual cameras on both sides help to produce the bokeh effect with a blurred background which we all happen to love so much. It comes with 2-level brightness flash with 120degree lighting angle up front. Along with it, you get stickers and beauty mode if you’re in for it.   During the launch event, Mr. Joyas, Director of Huawei\xa0Technologies Nepal Co. Pvt. Ltd. said,   “We know what’s essential to today’s consumers, and we created a new device that packs powerful features to keep up. We’ve come up with Nepal’s first 4 camera smartphone, designed to help you engage with everyone, where there are in the world, the Huawei nova 2i sets a new standard in innovation with its incredible performance, stylish design, and advanced camera features.”    Mr. Pulkit Bhimsaria, director of Call Mobility (Huawei’s sole distributor for Nepal) said,   I have a strong believe this revolutionary 4 camera smartphone at this very best price should be number 1 in the market. For Huawei, quality always comes first, from the time it started in Nepal it never compromised on quality. Our records of after sales service center is a proof that we have the least failure rate in the global market. Nova phone will speak for itself, its a new beginning of Huawei revolution in Nepal.

The Oppo F5 launch ceremony had Nepal idols and few celebrities from the Nepali film industry. Having them as the witnesses and with the performances from the Nepal idols, the program unveiled the specs and the price of the Oppo F5.   Oppo came with the tagline “Camera Phones”, which revamped to “Selfie expert” last year. Now boasting themselves as the expert in taking selfies and leader in the business, they have now changed their tagline to “Selfie expert and leader”. The new  Oppo F5  features the most hyped AI-powered selfie camera and bezel-less display with 18:9 aspect ratio. But what more it has to offer? Let’s find out.

With three smartphones stacked together, the red variant looked vibrant and catchy, which also happens to be the premium variant among the bunch with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. So I picked the device and used it for a while.   The device was thin and light with a streamlined body, which made it easier to hold and to have a grip on. The 6-inch display with narrow bezels was the feature that takes all the credit for its elegance. The phone was powered by Helio P23 chipset aided by Mali-G71 MP2 for the graphics portion. On my quick play with the device, I could not test the phone’s performance with the heavy games. However, with the light apps and games in play and multitasking with them, the phone was quite fluent.  Since Oppo F5 is the camera-centric phone, I concentrated on testing its camera for most of the time. The rear 20MP camera takes decent photos at times but lacked the consistency on providing good images in every scenario. The photos were washed out sometimes and sometimes the images turn out to be over saturated. And in the low light scenario, the phone suffered highly. In addition, while I tried to record videos, the phone lacked the 4K recording option. A camera-centric smartphone with such blemishes, is it tolerable? I think no.  Similarly, to experience the Artificial Intelligence on the selfies from the self-proclaimed selfie expert and leader, I took few selfies. On taking selfies, my brown-colored skin tone was whitened, which looked natural most of the times. However, the shots taken with the Bokeh mode lacked sharped edges almost all the time. Also, the background was unevenly blurred at times, which made them unnatural and unrealistic. So to be frank, the selfie expert disappointed me a lot while taking selfies.   That was quick hands-on experience with the newly launched Oppo F5. We will come up with the full review of the device. So stay tuned to  GadgetByte Nepal  and get subscribed to our  YouTube channel .  Verdict on Oppo F5  Is the camera most important feature on a smartphone? Even if your answer is yes, Oppo F5, which happened to be a camera-centric phone struggled with taking good images at times. This is the most implausible and the most intolerable feature with the Oppo F5 and we have most features yet to overlook. So, in my personal opinion, the Oppo F5 does not deserve a price it is tagged with. So, I have short-listed few smartphones with the good cameras and overall performance that comes with a similar price tag and offers a great value for money.

['Apple will release three new iPhones Next Year'],['Apple'],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['November 14, 2017']",2017-11-14 13:43:07+00:00,"['2017 has been a good year for Apple, with their stocks reaching an all-time high after the  iPhone X  launch. It’s because people seem to really love the iPhone X, the first iPhone with a bezel-less\xa0AMOLED display. And Apple is trying to capitalize on their current success, with talks of three new iPhones in 2018.  2017 did see three iPhones, but the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus didn’t quite share the same success as it’s bezel-less sibling. So the three iPhones in 2018 will feature the same new bezel-less design with the controversial notch up top. With so much complains about the notch, I really hope Apple removes it and bring something innovative.  The 5.8-inch iPhone, the biggest screen real-estate on iPhone as of now, will be the smallest next year. There are plans for two more iPhones with even bigger displays. One with a 6.1-inch screen and the other with a 6.5-inch display.        The 5.8 and 6.5-inch screens will enjoy the OLED technology, whereas the 6.1-inch iPhone will come out with an LCD panel. This implies that, although a huge display, the 6.1-inch iPhone will likely be an entry-level smartphone from Apple for 2018. It will also have the lowest pixel\xa0density of around 330 PPI and will carry $650-$750 price tag. Other factors might also come into play for the low price of 6.1-inch iPhone.  The 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch iPhones will feature the same OLED panels with a pixel density of 458 PPI and 500 PPI respectively. All three of the iPhones will also incorporate the on-screen fingerprint sensor which was supposed to come with the current iPhone X. So, with the current pricing strategies, the 6.5 inch iPhone will comfortably cross the $1000 price tag.  None of this news has\xa0been confirmed by any official sources and it’s all based on the leaks that have surfaced on the internet. Some of this won’t actually pan out. But it will be exciting to see a cheaper and bigger iPhone. Making big waves will obviously be the larger 6.5-inch iPhone. So what do you think of a 6.5-inch iPhone with a notch(again) making it’s way to production?

['Is 120Hz Refresh Rate on display the future of Smartphone?'],['Opinion'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['November 14, 2017']",2017-11-14 07:30:29+00:00,"['Previously when the smartphone space was starting to feel unimaginative, we began to see few new changes, especially in the display domain. First came the edge to edge panels, and recently when tall 18:9 aspect ratio were taking over there’s a new buzz of the 120Hz refresh rate displays. So whats up with this high refresh rate? Is it the next big thing on a smartphone?  So what is 120Hz refresh rate?  120Hz refers to the number of times a display panel can refresh itself. So with a 120Hz panel, it can refresh the display 120 times in one second. This can also be measured in terms of frames per second. In general, it’s a display that can render contents at 120fps. Higher the refresh rate, smoother the video appears, meaning it can capture fast movements by\xa0removing motion blurs. But there’s a limit to how much smoothness a human eye can perceive and how natural the content might look at higher frame rates. If you switch from 30fps to 60fps then the difference is immense but any further from 60fps just feels gimmicky for daily usage.  How does it affect viewing content?  Although the display might be refreshing on 120Hz, it’s likely useless if the content you’re viewing is running at the lower refresh rate. Basically, if we talk about smartphones, most of the apps run at 24 or 30fps and few games at 60fps. A 60fps video\xa0will be no different on either a 120Hz or a 60Hz display. Any content above 60fps is going to look unnatural and may seem extremely fast compared to what we are used to. Watching videos which involve\xa0people and them talking, then higher refresh rate will make it seem really unnatural but if it’s nature documentary, sports or gaming, then you’re in for a treat. It’s just the smoothness of the video and doesn’t have anything to do with the details.        On handheld devices, we have seen the 120Hz panel on  Razer Blade Smartphone  and the  iPad Pro . Apart from videos, the high refresh rate will come in handy when you’re scrolling through contents, typing or switching apps.  Future of Smartphone Display  So in 2018, we might see few flagship phones with a 120Hz display as the craze for VR and AR contents are on the rise. The higher refresh rate will help to make the Augmented content appear more realistic with real-life motion. Obviously, it will need a faster processor to push the device which in turn will also be affecting the battery life. But these high refresh rate displays are usually adaptive as it will adapt refresh rate based on the content being displayed in turn saving the battery life. It’s almost certain that this feature won’t make it to most of the devices in 2018 and a better implementation may take some years. Instead, we will see bezel-less displays with fingerprint incorporated\xa0into the display, higher pixel density, new display panel maybe and even 3D displays which is in the making by the awesome camera manufacturer RED.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/120hz-smartphone-display.jpg']

It is a smart bracelet that helps you keep track of your health on a continuous basis, checking for physical indicators like sleep, number of steps you take and heart rate.  Apart from the other things this band offers, I was at the first sight, impressed by its looks. You can see for yourself, it looks very stylish on your wrists. You might want to take it off once you wear it.         It has a modestly large screen and the silicon straps give it a sleek finish. It is so light and comfortable that you don’t even feel you are wearing anything on your wrists. Initially, the buckle pins may be hard to get used to, but once you do, wearing it feels as easy as breathing.  Moving to the main features, the Lenovo HW02 offers you a personal fitness tracker aided by a pedometer, a sleep monitor, a heart rate monitor and a calorie burn meter. When you touch the screen, first, it shows time. Then, it shows you the number of steps you have taken on that particular day. You can reset it every day. Then when you touch again, it shows you how many calories you have burnt. Similarly, next shown is your heart rate, state of the battery and Bluetooth status.                The band coordinates with your smartphone via, the Lenovo healthy app connected through Bluetooth 4.2. The app is available in both app store and play store. The app once signed in needs to be bound with the band to get updates on your physical condition. The information is displayed on a 40×72 pixel OLED screen.   The app is in its latest version for now but, however, is not very smooth in running as it gets stuck many times.  The thing I like about it is that it has a smart reminder feature that lets you customize notifications and gives you vibrating sensations when you receive calls, texts, Facebook notifications, and the like. Second is the alarm feature that helps you wake up without having to listen to fussy alarm clocks.   You can set movement targets for every day on the app and it also notifies you if you are moving closer to achieving them. The band, I must say, interacts very well and the readings are pretty accurate too. The app also shows you the history of your physical conditions in a bar graph and lets you compare daily, weekly or monthly status. This includes data on movement, sleep and heart rate monitoring.  The band is waterproof so you can also choose to swim or take a shower while putting it on. It has a plastic and a\xa0silicon finish, so it may be prone to scratches but breakage seems unlikely. The battery lasts for 7-10 days depending on your usage pattern.   With all these, the Lenovo HW02 may seem like an upright daily driver. However, one major concern here is the brightness. Unless you have godly eyesight, in broad daylight, it impossible to read what’s there on the screen. The silicon straps are prone to scratches now and then.  Conclusion  The band is easy to use, good looking and pretty accurate. On the other side, the low brightness gives it a meltdown. But since I have been using it for days now, I think it is a good deal considering its features and is worth the money you keep aside for it.   Buy Here [20% off coupon code:20swad]']",[]

['Top phones in Nepal with stock-like Android software'],"['Android', 'Guides', 'Buy Guides']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['November 9, 2017']",2017-11-09 15:31:12+00:00,"['If you ask me, stock Android is the perfect form of the software. Although the perfect stock Android experience is yet unavailable in Nepal as of now, there are other devices that are somewhat near to that experience. But before getting to what phones in Nepal have a stock like android, for those who are unfamiliar with the term, let’s first get what stock Android actually is!  In simple words, stock android is the term used to describe the ‘purest’ or the ‘untouched’ form of android. We know that Google is the pioneer of Android; so, stock android is the form of Android that Google provides and has no modifications whatsoever. Smartphone companies add skin to the stock android with what they think their users would want to use and create ‘their’ own form of Android to provide a different experience. For example, Samsung devices come with TouchWiz, HTC offers Sense UI, etc.  Here is the list of top phones that provide stock-like Android experience in Nepal:        1. OnePlus series   Smartphones of the OnePlus series use Oxygen OS. It is not completely stock Android but is nearly stock like. All the phones in the OnePlus series feature Oxygen OS with minimal changes to the stock form.     Device  OnePlus 5  OnePlus 3/3T    Display  5.5-inch, full HD Optic AMOLED display  5.5-inch full HD Optic AMOLED display    Chipset  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835  Qualcomm Snapdragon 820/821    CPU  Octa-core processor  Quad-core processor    Software  Android v7.1.1 Nougat with\xa0Oxygen OS  Android v7.1.1 Nougat with Oxygen OS    GPU  Adreno 540  Adreno 530 GPU    RAM  6/8 GB  6 GB    Storage  64/128 GB  64 GB / 128 GB    SIM  Dual SIM  Dual SIM    Rear camera  Dual 16 MP + 20 MP with dual LED flash  16-megapixel with LED flash    Front camera  16 MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture  8 MP / 16 MP    Sensor(s)  Fingerprint sensor  Fingerprint sensor    Battery  3,300 mAh with Dash Charge  3,000 mAh / 3,400 mAh with Dash Charge    Price  Rs. 59,500 / Rs. 69,500  Rs. 39,900 / Rs. 49,000     2. Nokia Series   The Nokia series landed in Nepal few months ago. Not only do these smartphones provide high value for money, they feature stock Android software as well. Currently, Paramount Electronics is selling five different models of Nokia of different price range, namely Nokia 2, Nokia 3, Nokia 5, Nokia 6 and the newly launched  Nokia 8 which is available for  prebooking in the time of writing this article.  If you want to know all about the Nokia smartphones including their specifications and pricing, be sure to read our article on the light of  Nokia mobile phones available in Nepal right now .  3. Xiaomi Mi A1   Xiaomi’s latest  Mi A1  features Android One, which is indeed stock android for phones other than Google’s flagships. In addition to the stock form, it offers apps like Mi Store, Mi camera, Mi remote, etc.   Display:  5.5-inch full HD LTPS display, Gorilla Glass, 2.5D curved glass  Chipset:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC  CPU:  2.0 GHz Octa-core processor  Software:  Android v7.1.2 Nougat, upgradable to Android v8.0 Oreo and Android P  GPU:  Adreno 506 GPU  RAM:  4GB RAM  Storage:  64GB internal storage, expandable up to 128GB with microSD  SIM:  Dual Hybrid SIM  Rear Camera:  Dual 12 MP + 12 MP rear-facing cameras  Front Camera:  5MP front-facing camera  Sensors:  Fingerprint sensor, Infrared sensor  Connectivity:  USB Type-C, 4G connectivity  Battery:  3080mAh Li-ion battery  Price:  Rs. 29,999   4. General Mobile GM5 Plus   Similar is the  General Mobile GM5 5 Plus  which is Android One like that of Mi A1. Similar to the Mi A1, there are apps in GM5 plus like GM calculator, GM screen, GM alarm, etc. which are additional features it has added to its own.   Display:  5.5-inch IPS LTPS Full HD (1080×1920 pixels) display; Corning Gorilla Glass 4  Chipset:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 Octa-Core 64 Bit  RAM:  3GB LPDDR3  Storage:  32GB Storage (expandable up to 128GB)  Rear Camera:  13MP AF with Dual Led Flash  Selfie Camera:  13MP AF with Fron  t Flash  Connectivity:  Type-C connector, GM Turbo Charger  SIM:  Hybrid Dual SIM  Software:  Android v7.0 Nougat (upgradable to 7.1.1)  Battery:  Li-Po 3100mAh Battery  Price:  Rs. 19,999   5. Moto E4 plus   Motorola was once owned by Google itself, so this phone in its bucket having stock Android is not a shocker. In addition to what stock Android provides, Motorola features ‘Moto’, for phone customizations. The  Moto E4 Plus  was recently launched in Nepal along with 3 other smartphones.

Colors P85+ Selfie Pro   Another one in the list is the new Colors phone, the  Colors P85+ Selfie Pro , that is thought to be a decent choice below Rs. 15,000 in Nepal. It uses Android in a near stock form, without having adulterated the original version a lot. However, the company has not named their version of Android.   Display : 5.5-inch HD IPS LCD with 2.5D glass on the top; Dragontrail Glass Protection  Chipset : MediaTek MT6735  CPU : Quad-core 1.3GHz (ARM Cortex-A53)  GPU : Mali-T720  RAM : 2GB  Storage : 16GB internal storage, expandable up to 128GB via MicroSD  Front Camera : 8 MP (Hynix HI846 COB6 Sensor), f/2.2, LED flash  Rear Camera : 13 MP (Samsung’s 3L8 Sensor), f/2.0, 1.12µm pixel size, Auto Focus and LED Flash  Connectivity : Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, A-GPS, 3G, 4G LTE, OTG supported  Sensors : Fingerprint, Accelerometer, Proximity, Ambient Light sensor  Battery : 3000mAh (non-removable)  Colors : Golden White  Price : Rs. 14,999   Stock android certainly has abilities that customized Android skins cannot offer, below listed are a few:   Faster security patch and Android version updates:  Android has always been criticized for potential security threats and because customized Android software have to develop their brand-specific versions of updates, it takes them more time and users may be exposed to malware and threats. With stock android, you get updates as soon as Google rolls it out. So, patching flaws is faster. Same is with the Android versions. With stock Android, you won’t have to spend months and months waiting for the software update.  Less bloatware:  Stock android is exactly what Google intends their users to use and doesn’t bring along unnecessary extras. When smartphone companies add their layer of skin to Android, they also add additional applications. For example, while Google provides you with Chrome, others may provide you with a different browser. These apps, moreover, are very difficult to remove.  More storage and better battery life:  When you don’t have unnecessary apps taking up your storage, you can choose to download whatever you want. The extra load of apps may have an effect on battery performance, so with stock android, your battery life can be optimized.  Personalize to your liking:  Stock Android gives you the freedom to use whatever launcher you want, while there are very few things you would want to uninstall. Stock android has very few apps, so you can choose to add is up to you. Your device is yours to personalize!   Stock android is not, however, perfect! \xa0Stock android has a lack of customization features and so on. Whether you like a customized or a stock form of Android, it’s purely a matter of choice!

That’s the exact amount Broadcom is ready to pay to buy Qualcomm. If this deal pans out, it’s going to be one of the biggest tech acquisition\xa0ever. So why is Broadcom shelling out so much for Qualcomm, and is this transaction really worth it? Before answering that, let’s check the background of both of the companies  Broadcom  Broadcom is a global semiconductor leader, manufacturing anything from wired infrastructure to wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industries among others. Their products include\xa0data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and displays.  If you use an Apple smartphone user (iPhone), then you are definitely using Broadcom components, and that’s one of the simplest ways to explain it.        Qualcomm  “Qualcomm\xa0is an American multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company that designs and markets wireless telecommunications products and services. It derives most of its revenue from chip making and the bulk of its profit from patent licensing businesses.” – Wikipedia  And if you didn’t already know, Qualcomm is the maker of the Snapdragon line of processors. You are probably using a Qualcomm made processor on your smartphone right now.  Why is Broadcom paying $130 billion?  When we talk about deals that involve a huge much investment, there needs to be a long list of reasons. Broadcom surely has quite a few compelling reasons of its own. For starters, we can see that Broadcom wants to “create a one-stop shop for smartphone makers looking for everything from cutting-edge processors to wireless networking.”   “The thing about technology is that many skeptics just don’t understand how the industry has gotten so much bigger, which means these companies are a lot more valuable to each other than you might think.”  -mad money host   In the world of semiconductor revenue sales, Intel leads the bunch followed by Samsung Electronics. And if this deal in talks was to go through, Broadcom/Qualcomm partnership will see them take the third spot by a margin.  Lots of factors go into making these kinds of decisions. And when it’s one of the biggest potential deals, the stakes are even higher. We should also consider that this deal will most probably not go through.  “A deal would face antitrust scrutiny in markets where Broadcom and Qualcomm have leading positions, such as integrated circuits used in global navigation satellite systems,” says Erik Gordon, a professor at Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/broadcom-qualcomm.jpg']

The Vivo Y79 is a mid-range smartphone with some pretty interesting specifications.  Don’t Miss:  Vivo set to launch in Nepal  The Vivo Y79 is somewhat similar to the  Vivo V7+  which was launched in September. It has the same 5.99-inch HD IPS LCD FullView display – Vivo’s own name for the display with minimal bezels on the top and bottom. The display has an 18:9 aspect ratio. One major difference between these two devices is the processor on the inside. The Vivo Y79 is powered by an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor with 2 GHz of clock speed against the Snapdragon 450 of the V7+.         Now on to the optics side of the smartphone, Vivo has once again focused on the selfie shooter of its new smartphone. This Y79 is equipped with a huge 24-megapixel lens with f/2.0 aperture on the front which is accompanied by the Moonlight Glow LED flash. On the rear is a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture and dual LED flash.  The Vivo Y79 runs on Android v7.1 Nougat out of the box with Funtouch OS 3.2 on top. It has 4 GB of RAM and its graphics side is handled by Adreno 506 GPU. The Y79 features 64 GB of onboard storage which can be further expanded up to 256 GB via a microSD card.

So, Apple has a higher profit margin for the iPhone X, I should say it’s only fair. Nobody wants the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus and are readily happy to pay a little more premium for the fancier iPhone X.

However, Microsoft is completely shutting down the free campaign on 31st December 2017.  Right now, a copy of Windows 10 will run you about $119.99. And this is quite an expensive amount to pay for. So, if you haven’t upgraded already, now would be a really good time. But then again, if someone hasn’t taken an advantage of this free offer for over two years, they probably don’t care at all.

['What’s new in MIUI 9 for Xiaomi Devices'],['Xiaomi'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['November 4, 2017']",2017-11-04 09:56:57+00:00,"['Xiaomi phones are one of the most popular product in Nepal. It’s not just because of the great hardware experience you get at an affordable cost but its the software experience as well that we’ve all grown to love. Recently the official update for MIUI 9 has started rolling out for Xiaomi devices and your could be receiving it soon. But before that let’s find out what new changes the MiUI 9 brings to the table.  App Vault   App vault is like the Google Now screen from Google Now Launcher or the Shelf panel from OnePlus which you get when swiping right on the home screen. You can stick your frequently used apps, widgets, calendar events, sports update and more. This feature will help to keep your apps and widgets in an organized way and also get to them in a jiffy.        Animated Icons   MIUI 9 now comes with animated icons. Some of the system apps like Phone, Browser, Messaging, and other apps like Facebook, Messenger and Instagram have playful animations on their icon when you exit from those apps. This is certainly a neat feature that makes the UI look more lively, plus, XIaomi claims it doesn’t hamper the battery life as well.  Split Screen   Although split screen mode was introduced on Android Nougat, Mi Devices running Nougat didn’t have that feature. It was a bummer for a lot of users to not have such a handy component. The MIUI 9 has now brought the split screen mode for Xiaomi devices. You can even switch between the top and bottom app which is a nice touch.  Notifications   MIUI 9 now supports bundled notifications where all the notifications from a single app will be bundled as a single notification. This makes\x1b the notification area more clean and concise. Quick Reply from notifications has also been enabled. The notificaitons shade has also changed making it more close to stock Android.  Enhanced Silent Mode   Looking at the pattern of changes in the new MIUI 9, it seems like Xiaomi has added the core or basic features of Android Nougat that was missing from its ROM. One of such feature is the time-bound silent mode. While turning on the silent mode, you can now select how long to keep the phone at silent.  Mi Drop   Mi Drop is a built in app from Xiaomi which helps to transfer files among Xiaomi devices. It is simialr to Xender or ShareIt. The Mi Drop app has been optimized and the UI has been made minimal for ease of use.  Video and Gallery App   The stock Video and Gallery app have also gotten pretty impressive with the new update. Video app now can group simiar videos based on shows to have a consistent layout. It also has support for multiple subtitles and languages. The option to hide videos is present as well.   In the gallery app, the stock editor has introduced the “Smart Photo” feature to remove the unwanted objects on the background without affecting the integrity of the photo. Such editing could be achieved by an app called TouchRetouch which costs $2.12 on App Store.  Lock screen   The lock screen on MIUI 9 doesn’t feel that different unless you swipe right to get the new connected devices page. As Xiaomi now has a lot of smart home devices, for those who use them can now access from this page. This page also has an option for a flashlight on the bottom. Other than that, it also shows the remaining time to charge the phone.  New Icons and Animations   MIUI 9 has introduced new icon packs and animations which makes the UI look more fun and interactive. The icons are both colorful and minimal. There’s also new opening and closing animations which makes the phone feel even faster.  Optimization   Talking about being fast, MIUI has been optimized heavily to go head to head with stock Android. Even with the same hardware, MIUI now runs much faster and smoother which is a good news for those with old Xiaomi devices. App loads faster than before and few of the fixes have minimized the app crashes. Even on test videos, the MIUI 9 performed much better than other phones with similar specifications. The new update has also patched the KRACK vulnerability.  List of Xiaomi Phones Receiving the MIUI 9 Update  Unlike other Chinese manufacturers, Xiaomi is very consistent about updates. Most of its phone gets either Andorid or security udates from time to time. And this time around, a lot of phones have made it to the list to get the MIUI 9 update.  2017  Mi Mix 2 ,  Mi Note 3 ,  Mi 6 ,  Mi Max 2 ,  Redmi Note 4, Redmi Note 4X ,  Redmi Note 5A ,  Redmi 4X ,  Redmi Y1, Redmi Y1 Lite.  2016  Mi Mix ,  Mi Note 2 ,  Mi 5 ,  Mi 5s ,  Mi 5s Plus ,  Mi Max, Mi Max Prime ,  Redmi Note 3 ,  Redmi 3, Redmi 3s ,  Redmi 4A  2015  Mi Note,  Mi 4i ,  Redmi 2, Redmi 2 Prime , Redmi Note 4G Prime, and Redmi Note 2  2014  Mi 4 , Redmi Note 4G  2013  Mi 3  2012  Mi 2']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MIUI-9-Features.jpg']

['iPhone X facial recognition shows mixed results in identifying twins'],['Apple'],['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['November 2, 2017']",2017-11-02 12:28:26+00:00,"['The  iPhone X  is Apple’s most expensive smartphone till date.\xa0 Among the others, the face recognition feature of it has made a buzz around the world. While the company has always claimed that the feature may not give the best results for twins, triplets, and children under the age of 13, it has now been revealed that the system is not totally fruitless in that area.  Apple wasn’t hesitant in sharing that the probability of someone else unlocking your iPhone X with the face recognition feature is 1 in 1,000,000 compared to 1 in 50,000 with the touch ID.\xa0 Further, it added that the probability of a false match is different for twins and siblings that look like you as well as among children under the age of 13, because their distinct facial features may not have been fully developed.  Various companies have put the feature to test and have come up with different findings.  Mashable  ran the test for two sets of identical twins, both of whom suffered false matches. The Face ID failed to register the difference for them. Similarly, another test by the  Wall Street Journal  showed that once, Declan registered his face on the system, both his brothers were able to unlock the iPhone X without much effort.         However, the finding of the test done by  Business Insider  begs to differ from the others. When testing the phone with one set of twins, one of who tries on a hat, a scarf, then all three, the phone passed the tests. The phone unlocked for one of them but not the other.   Meanwhile, when put in tests in normal conditions, reviewers seem fairly positive about the iPhone X face recognition system. They say that it works in low light, with glasses on, sunglasses on; making it nearly accurate.  Whether twins or children under thirteen, if your phone gets unlocked by others, it is an alarm! Similarly, this certainly is a downside because touch ID works very well for issues as such. Meanwhile, another piece from Mashable article stated that Windows has already solved the setback with its Windows Hello Facial Recognition system! Whether Apple can set itself free from this concern, we are yet to see.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/iphone-X-facial-recognition.jpg']

The same service that used to cost you around Rs 2 every week is finally a free service now.  What is Ncell Missed Call Notification?  Missed Called Notification or as Ncell calls it MCN, is a service that enables you to not miss calls even when your phone is turned off or out of network coverage.  How does it work?  You will receive a detailed SMS notification of all the calls you missed as soon as you switch on your mobile phone or when you enter the network coverage area.        We understand your every call is important  How much do I have to pay?  It used to cost Rs 2.51, but this service is free as of today, November 1.  How do I subscribe to this service?  All you need to do is call  *9141#  and you will automatically be subscribed to the service.  Verdict on Ncell Missed Call Notification Service (MCN)  It is not always possible to stay on the same place forever. Even if it was possible, there is not a guarantee to receive the network signals of the phone every single time. And what happens if somebody calls at\xa0such times of signal/network unavailability? Needless to answer, we would miss the call. That’s only the case of signal unavailability. We would face the same problem if we are busy on another call (if call waiting is not activated) or if the phone is switched off. So in order to avoid such scenario, Ncell had brought the Missed Call Notification service a long time back. And even used to charge Rs. 2.51 (with tax included) per week for the service a few days back.  Now with the charges lifted, Ncell seems to value the customers’ calls and willing to buzz about the missed calls for free. With this service activated, the users who missed the calls will receive text messages with the missed calls info as soon as they are available (receive the signals or have their phones switched on). With the service being free, most of the users are going to activate for sure. This also results in boundless communications among the people. So, cheers!  So, do you think this step from Ncell was important? With the service being free, are you going to activate it?

In doing so, the company has launched an entry-level Nokia 2 today, and it comes at a price of €99 in the international market. The price tag it carries has made it the cheapest Nokia smartphone around since the company’s reincarnation last February.  The Nokia 2 is a 5-inch device with 720 x 1280 pixels resolution. The IPS LCD display is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Unlike the rumored Nokia 9, which will supposedly come with minimal bezels, this device has a traditional display with 16:9 aspect ratio and 67.4% of screen-to-body ratio. The new Nokia 2 is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 SoC and a Quad-core CPU with 1.3 GHz of clock speed. The performance of this device is further supported by 1 GB of RAM and Adreno 304 GPU.         The Nokia 2 runs on Android v7.1.1 Nougat right out of the box which will be upgraded to Android v8.0 Oreo in the near future.

As far as the cameras are concerned, the Nokia 2 has an 8-megapixel rear-facing shooter accompanied by a LED flash and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter.  The USP of the device is its 4,100 mAh battery which, according to HMD Global, will provide two or more days of battery life under minimal usage. With this huge battery, it can sure go up against some of the popular entry-level smartphones available right now. HMD Global has also boasted the inclusion of Google Assistant in the device, mentioning it to be the first of its kind in the entry-level smartphone category.  The Nokia 2 will go on sales starting mid-November in the international market. It is available in three color options, namely, Black, White, and Copper.

"['Colors P85+ Selfie Pro Review: How Good is this Rs. 15,000 smartphone?']","['Colors', 'Reviews']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['October 30, 2017']",2017-10-30 02:35:00+00:00,"['By launching a wide range of mobile phones catering to a varied demographic of customers, Colors Mobiles\xa0 Nepal has created a mark of itself in the Nepali smartphone market. Continuing their effort to provide excellent products to the customers at the best prices, Colors has launched its latest flagship phone: the  Colors P85+ Selfie Pro , priced at Rs. 14,995/-.  I got to use this phone for a couple of days and play around with its features and specifications. I tested out its marketed features during the 7 days and now, I am going to share my experiences with the phone to you. Leaving the judgment at your hands, for now, let’s walk through the highs and lows of the Colors’ flagship phone.\xa0         Build and Design  Speaking of the design and build of the phone, it looks almost the same as its predecessor: the Colors P85+. However, the phone includes commendable additional designs as well. Even if the build is actually plastic, the metallic finish on the phone is a wow. Hence, it would nit be\xa0wrong to say that the metallic chassis and unibody of the phone offer a premium feel on hold and on use.   Also, the phone falls on the lighter scale side and hence offers an easy usability.   Display  The P85+ Selfie Pro comes with a 5.5-inch IPS LCD screen, which is an upgrade to its predecessor: Colors P85+ which came with a 5.3-inch display.  The 720 x 1280 pixel resolution offered by the phone is okay. There is not much notable about it. Additionally, there\xa0were also some moments where I felt that the display could have been better in terms of color vibrancy and sharpness.   Moreover, the 2.5D glass topping adds to the elegance of the phone giving its an extra push. For someone like me, who can be as clumsy as one can be, the Dragontrail Glass protection over the display was an added assurance.\xa0   The presence of MiraVision engine in the phone is also an additional benefit. With the freedom of choice to select the picture quality based on your requirement, one can easily toggle between the available picture modes and basic color tuning.  Hardware  All the buttons are placed on the right side of the phone, which I often messed up while use. Though the power button is easily reachable, I had to stretch my finger to reach the volume buttons. \xa0   The phone features a 3.5mm slot for a headphone jack at the top right and has micro USB 2.0 port at the bottom. The phone comes with a powerful speaker at the back, which performed well. One thing that I noted was the volume during phone calls. It could have been better optimised.  The fingerprint sensor on the phone is just as quick as promised (0.2 seconds). Also, it allows users to store up to 5 fingerprints at maximum. Moreover, there are touch and motion enabled gestures linked with the fingerprints which is something I really enjoyed using.\xa0   The smart gestures and multi-tap features allowed me to easily to unlock the phone and also launch my immediate priority apps with simple gestures.  \xa0  Software  The phone runs on Android Nougat 7.0 and delivers an efficient performance. However, there is not much to share about the UI of the phone, it is the same old: Stock Android UI. Though it is very minimalistic and quick, I am not much of a fan of it. So, I am not going to lie to you: I downloaded a launcher app on the phone just as soon as I got the phone.   I also enjoyed the split screen feature of the phone. Because of that, I could easily go through my image gallery and also take notes simultaneously. Also, the app drawer feature allowed me to efficiently switch between two recent apps, saving me from the hassle of app switching.  Also, for  security purposes , special features have been designed in the phone like Emergency Rescue and Smart Lock. The Smart Lock feature allows you to keep your phone unlocked by the on body detection mode, through trusted devices, voice and even at trusted places. And the Emergency Rescue feature let’s you choose trusted contacts and send messages to them in case you are in any emergency. This feature was actually something I was impressed with. I didn’t really test to see if it performed just as it had promised, but it is better to be safe than sorry!  Like in all other Android phones with Nougat and higher versions, the phone also includes  quick reply  feature which performed swiftly saving me the hassle of launching the apps and from the wrath of being the “online but unavailable” person.  \xa0  Performance  The phone features a 2GB  RAM and comes with an internal storage of 16GB expandable up to 128GB. The Quad-core 1.3GHz processor  teamed with MediaTek MT6735 chipset gives the phone a performance boost. Running multiple apps and switching between them was very easy. The split window feature is also available here, which allowed me to make the most out of available screen space.   There was not much heating issue on the phone even while running multiple apps which was a plus point. Also, with a single touch, I could clear out the apps in use at once which was very helpful for me.  However, there were also certain issues which were a let down for me. Many times, there were pop-up messages stating that the app has crashed and had to be closed. This was quite inefficient as the apps crashed mid-performance.  Camera  Speaking of the camera of the smartphone, the phone comes with a 13 MP primary camera and an 8 MP front facing camera. It offers a range of photography modes such as Panorama, Voice Photo, QRCamera, Exposure, Night, HD and Square. The inbuilt camera also allows users to take pictures in Professional mode and play around with features like ISO, WB and ET, manually.\xa0   The 8 MP selfie  camera  did not seem to perform as promised. The pictures appeared to capture details finely and pretty close to true colors. \xa0Nonetheless, they did appear a bit grainy. Even if the phone has been promoted as a “Selfie Pro”, I don’t think this performance qualifies it to be called one.   The 13 MP back camera was good enough. I took more than a few pictures this Tihar with this phone and honestly, I was more than impressed most of the time. Viewing Kathmandu through the 13MP rear camera and taking pictures of lights and mandalas was a fun experience.   Both front and back cameras are backed with LED flash that did provide proper lighting for pictures. However, due to the slow shutter speed of the cameras, I had to retake pictures multiple times just to take a steady shot      P85+ Selfie Pro Day Light     P85+ Selfie Pro Low Light     P85+ Selfie Pro Front Camera   Connectivity  The Colors P85+ Selfie Pro comes with Bluetooth 4.1, A-GPS, 3G, 4G LTE and OTG support. With Proximity sensor, Ambient Light sensor and Accelerometer.\xa0 The hybrid SIM slot in the phone allowed me to use a nano-SIM and a micro-SIM simultaneously.\xa0\xa0  As the phone is 4G enabled, the browsing speed is very seamless. Communicating with friends and family while on the go was very easy.\xa0  The proximity sensor in the phone is also commendable as it worked absolutely fine with efficient screen timeout during calls. Also the smart lock in the system keeps the phone unlocked by the “on- body detection” mode when kept close to the body. Also, the phone features an ambient light sensor and A-GPS which helped enhance the performance.  Battery  I really appreciate the battery power and back up that the phone provided. The non-removable 3000mAh battery performed seamlessly. Though there was no quick charge functionality in the phone, the battery did provide me a good run time for 4.5 hours after one full charge.\xa0   Also, there is a “battery saver” mode inbuilt to the system which allows you to choose whether or not you want to save the battery life once you hit the 15% charge mark.   Verdict  To end with the final verdict of how I found the Colors P85+ Selfie Pro in the short time that I used it for, I must say that for a budget smartphone, this was a good one. The sleek and neat design of the phone and the feel of it itself was amazing. Additionally, the amazing battery backup helped me a lot with my continuous need of listening to music and working.  If you are looking for a budget-smartphone that keeps your wallet happy and fits well in your pocket (Yes, it fits!), this could be a good choice for you. Another quick information: this is the only phone within Rs.15,000 with 5.5-inch display.  However, the phone could probably have delivered much better in terms of the camera functionality. The performance it delivered in this department does not really seem to meet it’s marketed tag of “Selfie Pro”, which is a let down.  Pros: What I liked about the P85+ Selfie Pro   The remarkable 3000mAh battery.  The easy one-tap RAM cleaner.  The quick fingerprint scanner.\xa0  The budget.   Cons: What could have been better in the P85+ Selfie Pro?   Front Camera  The shutter speed.  A possible revamped UI.   What do you think about the Colors P85+ Selfie Pro? Would you give this a chance? Let us know in the comments below.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/colors-p85-selfie-pro-review.jpg']

It has only been a few days since the smartphone was launched in the international market but we have concrete news that it will launch in Nepal on November 14.  The Oppo F5 is, of course, a “selfie expert” that has Artificial Intelligence embedded into the software side of its optics.The front-facing selfie shooter measured 20-megapixels and has a relatively average f/2.0 aperture. As for the software side of this camera, artificial intelligence does its bit to beautify specific areas of a user’s face just to make the selfies come out better. And yes, just like the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, it also helps to capture images with a blurred background. The rear-facing camera is of 16-megapixels and has a comparatively wider f/1.8 aperture, and also an LED flash.         Now on to its display, the Oppo F5 has a 6.0-inch IPS LCD with narrower bezels giving it the proper ‘smartphone of 2017’ look. And yes, you guessed it right. This has resulted in the Chinese manufacturer placing a fingerprint scanner on the back of the device. The display has a resolution of 1080 x 2160 pixels and an 18:9 aspect ratio.  The Oppo F5 runs due to an Octa-core MediaTek MT6763T Helio P23 processor. This processor is further helped by 6 or 4 GB of RAM and Mali-G71 MP2 GPU. 6 GB of RAM is available in the 64 GB storage variant whereas 4 GB of RAM is available in a lower 32 GB version. On the software side, the Oppo F5 has Android v7.1 Nougat on the inside with ColorOS 3.2 on top.  Oppo F5 is expected to launch in Nepal in 4GB RAM and 32GB storage variant.  The Oppo F5 is powered up by a 3,200 mAh Li-Ion battery which lacks fast charging. The device supports Dual SIM and a dedicated microSD card slot. It is available in 3 color options in the international market, namely Black, Gold, and Red. The red color option is available only in the 6 GB RAM variant.  The device is expected to be priced at Rs. 35,000 which is closer to the international price tag of around $310.

It’s not as popular as NTC or Ncell but it is commendable that the mobile carrier is bringing something new to its users. Starting yesterday, 11th of Kartik, the company’s 4G service is officially up and running.  Smart Cell users in Kathmandu and Pokhara can instantly enjoy 4G network. The CAO of the company mentioned that service will be extending to other cities very soon. So, users from Chitwan, Birjung, and Nepaljung will be receiving the 4G treatment next.  Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA) gave Smart Cell the required permission to use frequencies of up to\xa012MHz of 1,800 MHz bands. As of now, Smart Cell is using 5Mhz frequency to deliver its 4G services.        NTA has asked Smart Cell to extend its 4G service all over Nepal. Also, the company needs to maintain the service’s quality according to NTA’s standards.  Ncell  and  NTC  have already started provided 4G services for a while now, with their expansion running at a steady pace.  Alongside the introduction of 4G, Smart Cell has introduced a few new data plans. New data rates remain the same with their volume doubled. This step puts their data rates on par with the likes of NTC and Ncell.  You can dial *141# for the complete list of Smart Packs for your Smart Cell network. If you are on the Smart Cell network, you can call 4242 for any inquiry you may have. If you happen to be on some other network, you can call 9611004242.  It’s good to see a carrier other than Ncell or NTC excelling in Nepal. If Smart Cell can capitalize on their current momentum, it might even prove to be one of the bigger competitors against the heavy hitters. Also, with the increase in competition, the users will surely benefit.  Comment below on what you think about the introduction of 4G by Smart Cell. Do you think more smartphone carriers should join the network carrier market or are you satisfied with the current telecommunication carrier situation of Nepal?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/smart-cell.jpg']
['Gionee X1S Review: A decent phone on a budget'],"['Android', 'Gionee', 'Reviews']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['October 28, 2017']",2017-10-28 12:18:13+00:00,"['Good phones are getting cheaper and cheap phones are getting better. This is all credits to the Chinese manufacturers who have made drastic leaps forward. Today we have another Chinese mid-range smartphone, the Gionee X1S, with us which is bound to prove itself as an example of how cheap phones are getting better. Lets find out if this Rs. 19,999 smartphone is worth your money.   Gionee X1S at a glance   Display:\xa0 5.2 inch IPS HD display with 2.5D glass and Gorilla Glass 3 protection  Processor:\xa0 1.5GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6737T CPU  Operating System : Android Nougat (v7.0) with Amigo UI 4.0 on the top  Some software features : App Cloning, Virus Detection, Power Manager, Split Screen  RAM : 3GB  Internal Storage : 16GB, expandable up to 256GB (dedicated slot)  Rear Camera : 13-megapixel with Autofocus and Dual-LED (Dual-tone) flash  Front-facing camera : 16MP, F/2.0 aperture, 1/3.1 inch sensor size with LED Flash  Special Camera Features : Face beauty (both on images and videos), Lambency Selfie, image+, etc  Connectivity : Dual-SIM, Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, Bluetooth, GPS, FM radio  Fingerprint Scanner : Yes, unlocks in 0.3 seconds  IR Blaster:\xa0 Yes  Other sensors:\xa0 Accelerometer, Gyro, Proximity, Compass  Battery : 4000mAh Li-ion battery  Colors : Black, Gold and Deep Blue  Price : Rs 19,999   Build:  The Gionee X1S features a full metal body design. However, considering a metal body, the build isn’t the best I have seen in a budget smartphone. The phone suffers from the usual squeaks and creeks, hinting at a not so good build quality.         However, with slightly smaller display (5.2-inch), it feels right in hand for single hand use.   Display:  The Gionee X1S comes with a 5.2″ IPS LCD display. The resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference. If you prefer battery life and performance, you will love it. But if you prefer a sharper and crispier display, this might disappoint you, especially when comparing it with other smartphones of the same price range.   The display of the Gionee X1S is by no means bad or dull. The colors are decent, the viewing angles are good, and the brightness is acceptable. However, the minimum brightness doesn’t really suit night time users. They will be better off using apps like twilight or screen dimmer. There is a built-in smart eye protection option in the settings menu but it doesn’t dim the screen. It, however, blocks  harmful blue light .  Performance:  The Gionee X1S rocks a Quad-core MediaTek MT6735 SoC with a clock speed of 1.44GHz. The bad part here is it’s based on a power hogging 28nm architecture, which doesn’t help its battery life or the heat. The device’s processor is supported by 3GB of RAM and 16GB of expandable storage.  The phone is decently snappy and fast.\xa0The HD display of the X1s also helps with the performance. All of the basic and social media apps run smoothly without hiccups. Even graphically demanding games run reasonably well. You will, however, end up with a really hot phone after gaming for some time. The 3GB of RAM helps with a little bit of multitasking and helps with a smooth experience altogether, although power users will end up with a salty experience.  Software:  I have never really been a fan of any Chinese smartphone’s UI. They are basically cluttered with their own set of half-baked apps and a lot of bloatware, and the Gionee X1S is no exception. But with a quick uninstallation of all the bloatware made me feel right at home. Again, if you happen to like the Chinese UI then you are all set to go, right out of the box.  The phone runs Android 7.0 Nougat with Amigo OS 4.0 on top. It comes with pre-installed apps like Gstore, theme park, mood wallpaper, mobile Anti-theft, child mode etc. which are pretty useless for me personally. The notification shade only shows you the notification. For quick shortcuts, you will have to swipe up to just like on the iPhones.      lock screen     home page     quick toggles   The lock screen is quite special as you get a set of 5 wallpapers that change every day. The fingerprint sensor on this phone is pretty fast but disappointingly enough, it doesn’t double as a multifunction button.  Hardware:  The front portion of the Gionee X1S is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 that ends with a 2.5D curve. There are three capacitive keys at the bottom. There is also an LED notification alongside the 16MP front-facing camera.             The headphone jack of the device is located at the top and there is a microUSB port at the bottom. The right side consists of volume controls and the power button. All of your SIM and Micro SD slots sit at the left. Finally, at the back, you get the rear camera, dual-tone flash, and a fingerprint sensor.  Camera:  Gionee claims its cameras to do wonders with the “super selfie” tagline and this device is no exception. The front camera of the Gionee X1S is a 16MP shooter which is accompanied by a front flash. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and a 1/3.1-inch sensor size to replicate plenty of details of the subject into the image. The primary camera takes some extraordinary pictures even in low light. The rear houses a 13MP camera placed right above the fingerprint sensor. It’s aided by dual tone LED flash. The secondary camera’s video recording caps out at 1080p.                The rear camera is okay-ish with good colors and details, and I have seen better camera lenses at the same price range. Low light images are a “meh” for me, with lots of noise and a loss in details.                      Connectivity:  The Gionee X1S comes with a dual SIM tray and a dedicated microSD expansion slot. It supports 4G along with other connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB OTG. Sensor wise, it has compass, light, accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope.  Battery:  The battery is probably Gionee X1S’ second best feature. This phone houses a huge 4,000 mAh battery which paired with a low 720p screen is a good combination for a better battery life. The downside here is the 28nm non-efficient SoC inside. The lack of optimization options has also hurt the battery. But all-in-all the battery life is still great.          The screen-on-time is around 5 hours under heavy usage. It takes me about 2 hours – 2 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. With the built-in battery saving modes, you will probably be able to gain more battery life. The standby time is, however, disappointing in this device. In some cases, the phone completely died on me overnight, even when I left it with 30% charge the night before  Verdict:  The Gionee X1S is priced at Rs 19,999, which makes it a budget-oriented smartphone. Considering the price, this device is one of the best I have used. The display, the camera, the battery, and the specifications of the device all together are decent considering the price. I have to say it offers a better selfie experience than what its competitors offer. The main downside is the build of the phone, although we have seen far worse in this price range.  Pros of Gionee X1S:   The front camera is one of the best in this price range  The battery backup is good  Fingerprint is snappy  The display quality is quite good   Cons of Gionee X1S:   Performance isn’t as good as its competitors  Build quality isn’t promising  Faces unexpected shutters some time  Connectivity could have been better  Screen resolution could have been higher   Alternatives of  Gionee  X1S  Samsung J7 Nxt    5.5-inch HD Super AMOLED display  1.6GHz Octa-Core 14nm Exynos 7870 processor with Mali T830 GPU  2GB RAM  16GB ROM, expandable up to 256GB with microSD  Android 7.0\xa0(Nougat)  13MP rear camera with LED flash, f/1.9 aperture  5MP front\xa0camera with LED flash, f/2.2 aperture  Dual SIM, 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS  3000mAh battery  Price of Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt in Nepal: Rs. 19,990   Sony Xperia XA Dual    5-inch (1280 x 720 pixels)\xa0 curved glass edge-to-edge display  Octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor with Mali T860MP2 GPU  2GB RAM, 16GB internal memory, expandable memory up to 200GB via microSD card  Android Marshmallow 6.0  Dual SIM (nano+nano)  13MP Primary Camera with 1/3” IMX258 Exmor RS sensor, 1080p video recording.  8MP front-facing camera with\xa0Sony IMX219 Exmor R sensor, 88-degree wide-angle lens  Dimensions: 143.6 x 66.8 x 7.9mm; Weight:\xa0137.4g  4G LTE, WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n , Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC  2300 mAh battery with\xa0Qnovo’s Adaptive Charging technology  Price: 19,000   Nokia 5    5.2-inch IPS LCD HD display with Gorilla Glass protection  Rear Camera: 13MP with f/2.0, PDAF Dual-LED (dual-tone) Flash  Front camera: 8MP with f/2.0  Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor  Android v7.1.1 Nougat  2GB of RAM  Internal Storage: 16GB  Expandable Storage: Up to 128GB  Sensors: Fingerprint (front-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  MicroUSB 2.0 (no USB Type-C), USB OTG compatible  Google Assistant  3000mAh Non-removable battery  Price: Rs. 20,000a']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gionnee-x1s-review.jpg']

We have seen it done in high-end cards before, and now we see it again. The already really powerful GTX 1070 is getting the “Ti” tag to its name, making it the Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti.  The new 1070 Ti is an upgrade to the existing 1070, but the question here is by how much? The 1070 currently goes for $399 and the 1080 goes for around $549.  The 1070 Ti has more Cuda Cores than the 1070, and has almost as much as on the 1080. The clock speed also has the same gradual increment, although with 1080 being more powerful has the same amount of power consumption, not that it matters a lot. Basically what you get here is an incremental upgrade over the 1070 but isn’t quite as good as the 1080.

The growing competition from AMD’s side might also have something to do with the 1070 Ti’s existence.   In conclusion, the 1070 was already a capable graphics card, and the 1070 Ti improves on it. The $150 price gap between the 1070 and 1080 has been closed down and now, for someone who needs more horsepower than the 1070 but doesn’t want to shell out the extra for the 1080 have somewhere to fall back on.  The 1070 Ti is already available for pre-orders and the shipping is expected to start from November 2nd. What do you think of the 1070 Ti, would you shell out the extra for the 1080 or just go for the cheaper 1070?

['Android 8.1 Developer Preview | Here’s Whats New!'],['Android'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['October 27, 2017']",2017-10-27 07:05:32+00:00,"['Google has always been open about its new software updates to the public eyes. \xa0Recently, even before Google I/O, the developer preview of Android Oreo was already out. Google has been providing early Developers Preview so that app developers can optimize their apps way before the new update roll out to masses. Today, Oreo 8.1, the latest version of Android has been rolled out for Developers. Here is what’s new from Android.  Visual changes on Android 8.1:  Wallpaper based System Themes:  Image: Android Police  We all hoped for the option to choose dark system theme on Android but that feature made into the Nougat built and got removed. Now, with the new WallpapersColor API, if your wallpaper is dark then system UI will have a dark accent. With bright wallpapers, you’ll get the system default UI. The dark theme will take effect on Quick Settings panel, folders, volume sliders, power menu, and app drawers.  Floating Power Menu  Image: 9to5Google  The power menu on Android 8.1 has got a new update that makes it look like the ones used on Pixel 2 and 2XL. The floating power menu now pops up on the right side where it provides an option for Power Off and Restart. The floating power menu is also affected by the Wallpaper based system themes.        Dimming Navigation Bar  Image: 9to5Google  The navigation has gotten some significant changes on the latest update. The icons are now more compact and closer making it easier for one-handed usage. Navigation bar now has auto-dimming feature. If your device stays idle then the opacity of navigation bar is decreased. Developers believe this will help prevent the screen burn issues on OLED panels like we’ve seen on  Google Pixel 2 .  New Oreo Easter Egg Logo   Android Oreo now has a proper Easter Egg Logo which is an Oreo Cookie with Android bugdroid. Previously Oreo had an Orange and Yellowish Logo with white in the middle which didn’t go well with the name of the release. The easter egg, however, has remained the same. If you tap on the Oreo Cookie 7 times, then an octopus will appear which you can drag around. The tentacle of the octopus also moves accordingly to then drag we use. That’s all, there’s no game like the flappy bird rip-off with Android bot.  Transparent Quick Settings Drawer  Image: 9to5Google  By now you must have the idea that most of the visual changes have\x1b been made to comply with the Pixel 2. Like in the Pixel 2, the Quick Settings Drawer is now semi-transparent. You can see what’s going on in the background when you have the drawer pulled down. This works with both Light UI and Dark UI.  Settings Menu Changes  Image: AndroidHeadlines  The Settings Menu got a big change with the Oreo update and it continues to evolve with the new one. The biggest change that you can notice right off the bat is the prominent search bar up top. As most of the settings are now grouped together, users may find it hard to find what they’re looking for so the new persistent search bar will surely catch the attention if you’re looking for something in the Settings Menu. Apart from that, the Gestures option has been brought up front inside the System tab which was hidden inside the Advanced tab.  Read more:   New Changes in Android Oreo  The internal changes inside the latest build are:  Neural Networks API  Use of AI on mobile devices is taking a leap and to support its developers Android has introduced the Neural Networks API. It is designed for running computationally intensive operations for machine learning on mobile devices. The API is created to provide support for the high-level machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and Caffe2. This makes tasks like image processing, pattern recognition and predicting user behavior much easier on Android.  Android Go Optimizations  With the launch of Oreo, Google has introduced the Android Go program that goes along with it. Android Go is a lightweight version of Android 8 which is meant to run on devices with low memory (1GB). The new update on Android Go allows developers to optimize their apps for devices with less memory running Android 8.1 and later.  Autofill Enhancements  Autofill feature allows password manager apps to fill up the passwords and bank details wherever required. The new update makes it possible to set the credit card expiry date to prevent users from using the card that has expired.  That sums up most of the new things that you get on the latest version of Android 8.1 Oreo. There are however more changes under the hood which is hard to explain in laymen terms. The official update of Android 8.1 Oreo will be rolling out on Pixel and Nexus devices in December.  Developer Preview is available for Download for the following devices:   Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Android-Oreo-8.1.jpg']

Early on, we saw some footage from Vivo demonstrating the  technology  but it didn’t seem to be that fast. The recent leaks point to Vivo again which shows a complete render of its new flagship, the Vivo Xplay 7.  So why fingerprint sensor under the screen? one might ask. The answer is plainly simple, we are moving towards the era of bezel-less displays. With no bezels, there is no place to stick that handy fingerprint sensor we all happen to love so much. It could be placed on the back or the sides, but it won’t\xa0 turn any heads, will it? Plus, having an on-screen fingerprint sensor seems more convenient and futuristic of course.         From the above image, we now know what the Vivo Xplay 7 looks like. Few internal slides from Vivo were leaked revealing the device from all sides. The phone sports a 100% bezel-less display which looks amazing. Instead of a notch for the camera, the phone seems to have screen cut-outs for the camera and sensors. The display will more likely sport a QHD Super AMOLED panel. Below the screen, we can find the indication of on-screen (ultrasonic) fingerprint sensor. Qualcomm and Vivo have worked on this tech together.   On the back, it comes with dual camera setup which is using the Sony’s IMX401 sensor. This will provide the phone with 4x Optical Zoom which is twice as much in comparison to today’s standard. Vivo Xplay 7 will sport the latest Snapdragon 845 chipset. It comes equipped with 8GB of RAM. Storage options include 128GB and 256GB with no support for microSD card. It comes with USB Type C and dual speakers at the bottom. The phone comes with unibody metal construct maintaining a slim form factor.  Vivo Xplay 7 is expected to launch during the first quarter of 2018. We’ll have to wait and see if it will be the first phone to house an on-screen fingerprint sensor and a 100% screen to body ratio.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vivo-Xplay-7-On-screen-fingerprint-bezel-less.jpg']

Microsoft does still have other game apps like solitaire and other classics if you wanna go all in on Microsoft apps.                   Microsoft Apps  Microsoft App is literally an app that has a catalog of all the apps Microsoft has created for Android. It has all of the apps categorized in seven different categories, so it’s easier for you to discover an app made by Microsoft.

They have been the idle phones with which every other flagship are being compared against. The Galaxy S8s are only 7 months old and rumors of the new Galaxy S9 has already started pouring in. Samsung will launch the S9 in April just like its predecessors. So, with 6months left for the launch, let’s see what’s cooking behind the doors of Samsung.  First and foremost an interesting rumor about the S9 is that it will sport the Exynos 9810. This new chipset from Samsung which will incorporate neural engine co-processors like the Apple’s A11 bionic chip used in the  iPhone 8s  and the Kirin 970 used in  Huawei’s Mate 10 . The Neural Processing Unit (NPU) will provide 25% more processing power with 50% more efficiency compared to Exynos 8895. Samsung has already invested more than $30million on a Chinese firm named DeePhi Tech for the AI chip.         The benefits of having an AI chip are faster processing capabilities and other fun AI stuffs like Image Recognition on the fly, better image processing, smoother Augmented Reality with the phone, and more personalized and readily accessible services. This chip can also enhance Bixby which is most often a looked down feature. Unlike Cloud AI which Google Assistant and Siri use, having an inbuilt AI chip can enable these services offline.  The second big thing about the Galaxy S9 is its fingerprint sensor. The placement of fingerprint sensor on the S8 and Note 8 has been a debatable for a while now. With 18:9 edgeless displays, phones are usually tall. There’s little to no space left to incorporate the fingerprint sensor up front. But a new leak suggests Samsung has patented a fingerprint technology that will be placed in front of a smartphone\x1b. With the existent edgeless display on the Galaxy S8s, a fingerprint sensor on the front bezel seems almost impossible. But this is the transition phase of the smartphone technology so it will be interesting to see how it will be implemented especially with the talks of fingerprint sensor under the screen. And in the next iteration, bezels will be even cut off further.   The display size and most of the form factor will likely remain the same. Both the S9 and S9+ could boast dual camera setup like in the  Galaxy Note 8 . To see what new the Galaxy S9’s will bring to the table, we’ll have to wait till MWC 2018.  Note:   We’ll be constantly updating this article with every new  leak  of the Galaxy S9.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Samsung-Galaxy-Galaxy-S9.jpg']

And keeping this in mind, Vatsal Impex, the official distributor of Xiaomi products in Nepal, has made it a lot easier for its customers to buy Xiaomi products with a new 0% EMI scheme.  According to the scheme, buyers can now purchase any of the Xiaomi products with 0% interest on EMI. Mi Nepal has paired up with Global IME Bank to bring the offer for the ones interested. But to buy a product on EMI, a consumer must go through different processes. First, they must make a credit card of Global IME Bank. For this, he/she must show their income source to the bank. The bank then deems whether the individual can afford the specific product on EMI or not.  While other banks take a few months to issue a credit card to an individual, Global IME Bank will issue the cards in an instant. But to get the credit card, one must pay Rs. 1,000 to the bank. Also, Global IME Bank charges Rs. 600 annually to their credit card holder. So, there is that. The Bank also gives a purchase order bill to the ones who are issued the credit card. This bill must be presented to Vatsal Impex’s office, so they can provide the product a consumer wants to buy.        This whole process is easier due to the “Easy Buy Easy Pay” scheme of Global IME Bank where a customer is issued a credit card in an instant.

Although it hasn’t shone at what it does, some of its smartphones, like the Leagoo M5, have made a name for themselves. So, to impress the Nepali smartphone users, Leagoo has launched the Leagoo P1 – a low-end budget smartphone that has some quite impressive specifications.  The Leagoo P1 is priced at Rs. 7,800. The device sports a 5.0-inch IPS display with the resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. It’s a bummer that only supports 3G connectivity, but we can’t expect a low-end device to come with 4G connectivity.  For selfie lovers, the Leagoo P1 has a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with f/2.2 aperture and a 77.9-degree viewing angle. On its rear is a dual camera set up. The smartphone has 8-megapixel and 5-megapixel rear-facing cameras. For night time photography, dual flash is equipped on the smartphone’s back.        This smartphone runs on Android v7.0 Nougat out of the box which is a welcome addition as we don’t usually see a low-end smartphone running on this operating system. It has Leagoo OS 3.0 Lite on top as a skin. Underneath the hood, the smartphone is powered by a 28nm Quad-core MediaTek MT6580A processor which is coupled with 1 GB of RAM and Mali-400 MP2. Storage wise, the device has 8 GB of memory on the inside which can be further expanded.  The Leagoo P1 will support some on-screen gestures like double-tap to wake. It has microUSB port on the bottom and a 3.5mm headphone jack as well. The device is backed up by a high capacity 4,000 mAh Li-Polymer battery.

We have been seeing edge to edge display and almost bezel-less displays for quite some time. But only cutting-off the bezels doesn’t seem to be the goal here. The recently launched Aquos R Compact sports a bezel-less display which also has the refresh rate of 120Hz.  Sharp is one of the first manufacturers to debut the concept of an edgeless display with the launch of Sharp Aquos Crystal back in 2014. And they also have been making phones with a 120Hz display for quite some time. Being limited in Japan only, sharp phones haven’t captured much attention of the international markets. The recent Aquos R Compact, however, resembles the trending phones right now like the Essential Phone and iPhone X with its notch for the camera. This notch seems to be the next big thing next to the edgeless panel.         The phone sounds cool with the edgeless panel but looks wise it’s not that welcoming. The side bezels seem huge compared to other phones and the bottom chin is just too big. Put this device in front\x1b of Mi Mix 2 or the Essential phone and it instantly looks clumsy. The notch holds an 8MP camera. On the back, it has 16.4MP Camera. The phone is powered by 14nm Snapdragon 660 processor clocked at 2.2GHz. It is equipped with 3GB of RAM and comes with 32GB of Internal Storage. The Sharp Aquos R Compact is running on Android 8.0 Oreo and is backed up by 2500mAh battery which is very low by today’s standard. On the bright side, it comes with Quick Charge 3.0.  What’s up\xa0with the 120Hz Refresh Rate?  The Sharp Aquos R Compact comes with a 4.9inch display. It doesn’t boast the new 18:9 standard, however. Most of our phones display is locked at 60Hz or lower and most of the apps also run within the same frame rate. Most of the processors today readily support higher refresh rate but for battery reasons and they are kept low. The higher refresh rate will ensure more smoothness while scrolling and zooming. But moreover, it will come in handy when you are viewing VR contents or AR contents which need faster refreshes to appear more real. Plus these are adaptive refresh rates, meaning, the phone will push higher refresh rate only when it’s needed. The same mechanism is also adopted by the newly launched iPad Pro. So, using higher refresh rate on smartphone displays right now is just an adoption of half-baked technology that is getting ready for the future.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sharp-Aquos-R-Compact-with-120hz-display.jpg']

So, we had to ask our readers which ISP they preferred the most. The results were quite a surprise, to be honest. Among the seven options that included “Others” and “All of them suck”, I personally choose the last option.  Although, without much surprise,  Vianet  got the highest number of votes, a total of 345, accounting for 30%. Well, that did make it a winner of some sort. Users were also pretty expressive on the post’s Facebook comments as well.  The one that surprised us was the number of votes ClassicTech got. With 27% or 311 votes to its name, you could say it took the second spot. However, some people had a very strong opinion about this particular ISP on our Facebook post.        Worldlink accumulated about 200 or 18% of the votes, which was something we didn’t expect to see. Worldlink likes to boast about their total number of internet subscribers, but only handful of people applauded its quality on our Facebook post.  There was an option with a quote “All of them suck”, and this tab managed to accumulate 13% of the total votes. A not so shocking result in any way. It just goes to show that Nepali ISPs need to treat their customers more seriously.  Finally, standing with 8% of the votes was NTC, which had one of the smallest and one of the most satisfied customers on our list. NTC’s users are particularly happy about the consistent internet connection, however, slow it may be. Delivering on your quoted low speeds seems far better than falling short on your big promises.  The tab that comprised of ISPs like Subisu, Otel, Web surfer, Board link and all the rest of the ISPs of Nepal managed a mere 3%. And finally, Ncell accumulated 1% of the votes, which probably had something to do with their extremely high prices.  Feel free to take part in our next poll this Monday.

Initiated as a winter-camp programme, Sroth Code basically was just a team of 4 individuals who came together. Inspired by Nepali art, culture and Hindu mythology, the developers have come up with mobile games like Haku Run, Tap Tap Turn, Tile Swap and their latest offering is Goatventure.  Read More:   Tap Tap Turn Game Review  Goatventure Gameplay  The protagonist of the game is a goat who runs past obstacles at times clearing them off the road and at times jumping over them. The controls of the game are also quite simple: you just need to tap to make the goat jump over or hit obstacles, while long presses allow you to make the goat high jump. Also, there are upgrades and special gifts available in the game that allow you to add special powers to the goat. Basically speaking, the game is all about making sure that the goat does not get caught by goons and that it does not hit any obstacles. As you run, you also need to collect through the course of the game which will allow you to extend and unlock various enchanting powers. Speaking of enchanting powers, there are magical power-ups available in the game, that either give you boosters and jetpacks or that evolve you into “SuperKhasi”, “BlackMetal Khasi” and other mystical beings.                         Currently available only on Android, the game is free and has a similar concept of the developers’ earlier release: Haku Run, where the protagonist also had to run and collect coins.   Also Read:  Haku Run: Game Review  Verdict  Honestly speaking, I did play the game more than a couple of times but all the while I felt like I was running in search of what I would enjoy in the game. Seeing the upgrades to the goat was a fun experience for me. And, as there were no indicators of when the upgrades would expire, I did lose more than a few games. There are also a few glitches and errors in the game, for instance: I had to download the game a few times to make it run, the music button does not function among others.

The company further envisions providing internet services that are 50% cheaper than what the cheapest internet service provider offers in Nepal on today’s date.  Currently, Hamro TV offers value to its consumers by providing them with 140 SD channels, 50 HD channels, and 3 4K ultra HD channels. With an aim to provide something extra for its consumers, the company asks for no installation charges. On top, it offers 50% discount in the monthly charges for its services for six months.  Hamro TV borrows its fiber and DTH equipment from the Chinese DTH equipment manufacturer, Gospell Digital Technology Co. Ltd. The company is known to specialize in the satellite TV equipment and provision of turnkey engineering services for Digital TV system.  The collaboration, thus, signifies that Nepal too is moving forward to provide global products.  “Communication and Information are pillars of a nation’s development and with the introduction of technologies as what Hamro TV is providing, it is certainly going to help Nepal climb the ladder and stand along with other nations of the world”, says Minister of Education, Sesh Nath Adhikari.

['ZTE Axon M with Dual Foldable Display Launched'],['ZTE'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['October 18, 2017']",2017-10-18 10:46:16+00:00,"['Innovation in smartphone space is moving at an alarming rate. Manufacturers are trying to incorporate the most unusual feature that might get mainstream. ZTE recently unveiled the latest phone in its arsenal, the ZTE Axon M. This is an unusual phone with a dual screen both on front and back, that might intrigue you with the way it looks and functions. So let’s discuss how much  practical\xa0 the phone really is.  ZTE Axon M comes with two screens both with almost similar dimensions. Both displays are of 5.2 inches boasting full HD resolution. Here’s nothing fancy like bezel-less display or the new 18:9 aspect ratio. The phone is powered by last year’s Snapdragon 821 Chipset coupled with 4GB of RAM. ZTE explains, because of the powerful processor and Android optimization they have been able to opt for dual displays.         The purpose of the dual display is purely usability. The display on the back can be brought up front by unfolding the hinge. When both the displays are up front\xa0it takes the form of 6.75 inches display, making it look almost like a tablet. ZTE provides four major options to make use of the Dual Display.  Uses of Dual Display on ZTE Axon M:   Dual Mode : Open two separate apps on both screens. Useful for multitasking.  Extended Mode : Use both screens as a single canvas. (Tablet Mode)  Mirror Mode : Project whatever is done in one screen to the next.  Normal Mode : Second display is off and folded back.    Dual Mode  is something I’d like to call  “true multitasking” .\xa0 You can use two different apps side by side in full view to use it without any hassles. It is even possible to play two different videos on individual screen at the same time but the audio will work only on one. You can also run two instances of the same app using gestures to push from one screen to the next. I wonder if we can split screen apps on both of the displays to use four apps at the same time.  Extended Mode  is something I’m really skeptical about. You can extend the screen to both of the display to get more screen real estate but the huge hinge in the middle looks just too disturbing for everyday use. It feels like your tablet has a giant line in the middle like when you damage your display.  Mirror Mode  might be useful when you have to explain something to people sitting up front or just watch a video more conveniently on either side.  In  Normal Mode , although both the displays incorporate Gorilla Glass 5, you have to be careful when you place the phone down as the second display will be facing towards the ground. It is very susceptible to scratches and damage.   One thing that’s bothering about the phone is that it is insanely thick at 12.1mm and weighs 230grams. Also carrying it in real life must feel really uncomfortable. The body holding the primary display is significantly thicker and heavy with all the ports and buttons. The phone comes with a single camera placed on top of the primary display. By default when you turn on the camera it will be facing towards you, to use it as a rear camera you have to flip the display to use the secondary display as camera’s viewfinder. In general, you have to keep track of which display you’re on which is again not convenient if you’re facing the phone on the wrong side.  Powering the ZTE Axon M is a 3,180 mAh battery which is a questionable size for a phone with the dual display but ZTE promises a full day of usage. It comes with fast charging 3.0 standard. The phone runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat. ZTE Axon M, in general, feels like a one step backward in usability rather than a foot forward. This device will be available in the US from next month priced at $725.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ZTE-Axon-M-Foldable-Display-2017.jpg']

The new descendent of the GoPro family is hailed as GoPro Hero6 Black, which is the successor to last year’s GoPro Hero5 Black. The Hero6 Black was introduced to the international market in the late September this year. Now in less than a month of time of its release, the device is available for purchase in the Nepali market.  Go Pro Hero 6 Black Overview  In terms of design and build, GoPro Hero6 Black seems to be cloned from its predecessor. The rugged and waterproof exterior on the Hero6 Black appears indistinguishable to the Hero5 Black. However, the presence of new processor is what makes the Hero6 superior. The Hero6 Black is favoured with a custom-designed ‘GP1’ processor, which is capable of delivering twice the performance of its predecessor.  The device features the same 2-inch touch screen, with the improvements being more vibrant display with punchy colours. The touchscreen is also more responsive than that of Hero5’s. Another major upgrade on the Hero6 will be its capability to shoot videos at higher frame rates. 4K videos can now be shot at 60fps, 2.7K videos at 120fps and Full-HD (1080p) videos at 240fps. With this feature, slow-motion videos can be shot and played without conspicuous stutters.         Transferring photos and video footages to the smartphone has also been made fast and seamless. The newbie uses 5GHz Wi-Fi because of which, the device is capable of transferring the data to the smartphones three times faster. To avoid shakes and blurs during the shots, Hero6 Black is provided with an improved Image Stabilization. However, the stabilization is through digital means (EIS) rather than the optical one (OIS).  The device inherits a 12MP camera, which takes RAW or JPG still images with High Dynamic Range and vibrant colours. The camera also takes nifty shots during low lights. Provided with a rugged and waterproof finish, Hero6 Black performs well on underwater too. However, the underwater depth has been limited to 10m (33 feet).  Hero6 Black also features QuickStories feature. With the information collected from different sensors, GPS, and accelerometer, QuickStories determines the most exhilarating parts of the footages. The GoPro’s custom app is also capable of editing the captured footages into exciting videos. In terms of pricing, Hero6 is the most expensive GoPro till date. As of its price in the Nepali market, the device has been seen on the shelf of SastoDeal embedded with a price tag of Rs. 46,500.  GoPro Hero6 Black Price in Nepal  The official price of GoPro Hero6 Black in Nepal is\xa0 Rs. 46,500.

It has the same 5″ HD display, the same exact Snapdragon 425 with 2GB of RAM and the 13MP back camera with f/2.2 aperture (video recording in 1080p at 30fps).  Talking about the difference, the 5A will feel a bit heavier, the dimensions, however, are almost exactly the same. The 32gb storage option isn’t an option anymore with the 5A only available with 16GB of internal storage. The battery capacity has also gone down by a hair with the only improvements being the front camera.        On the software side, the phone does run on a relatively newer Android\xa0Nougat with MIUI 9 on top. This is great because the Xiaomi Redmi 5A will most probably not receive any major software updates.  The addition of a fingerprint sensor would have been a welcome feature, but the need to omit features to keep the price down might have something to do with this.

The Huawei Mate 10, Mate 10 Pro, and Mate 10 Porsche Design shared the stage at an event in Munich today. The premium flagships from Huawei come at a time when  Samsung ,  Apple , and  Google  are all en route to claiming the title of the best smartphone in the market. And grabbing the opportunity, Huawei didn’t hold back to compare its new devices with the one from Apple and Samsung.  Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro Specifications   Huawei has completely redesigned its flagship smartphone. While the previous iteration of the Mate series had a more traditional look, the Huawei Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro come with what the Chinese company calls a “FullView” display, which basically is the near bezel-less design most Android flagship of 2017 feature.        The Huawei Mate 10 has a 5.9-inch 2560 x 1440 pixels display with 16:9 aspect ratio whereas its big brother, the Mate 10 Pro, sports a 6-inch 2160 x 1080 pixels display with a narrower 18:9 aspect ratio. Huawei has said that they opted for a full HD display in the Pro model for lesser power consumption. The normal variant, however, has an RGBW display which consumes less power.   On the back, both the devices are covered by a glossy glass back which comes in four different color options. There are two dual cameras at the top of both smartphones measuring 20-megapixel and 12-megapixel where the former acts as color sensor while the latter works as a monochrome lens. The dual cameras have world’s f/1.6 aperture which was previously seen on one of  LG V30 ‘s camera, and are accompanied by dual LED flash. There is also a laser autofocus technology engraved alongside the cameras.  As for their performance, both the Mate 10 and Mate 10 pro are powered by Huawei’s newest Kirin 970 chipset with neural-network processing unit (NPU). Each of the devices has a 4,000 mAh battery on the inside.  The Huawei Mate 10 has 64 GB of internal memory whereas the Mate 10 Pro comes in both 64 GB and 128 GB variant. In terms of RAM, the former version has 4 GB of RAM and the with the latter version, buyers get to choose between 4 GB and 6 GB of RAM.

Although most of its specifications are similar with the other two, it has a more premium build with an exclusive Diamond Black Glass on the back with Porsche accents. This device has 6 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. So, this device is solely meant for those who look for luxury in their handheld gadgets or more particularly smartphones.  What’s new on the Huawei Mate 10 series?  Artificial Intelligence  Well, even before the launch of the Mate 10 series, Huawei had already boasted about the series’ AI capabilities. And now that it’s out, I have to say, the computing world is already shifting from a mobile-first experience to AI first experience. The NPU on the devices’ chipset is adjusting the camera lens according to the object that is focused. Just like the  Google Pixel 2 , the Mate 10’s front-facing camera can also take selfies with blurred backgrounds.   Huawei Mate 10’s Desktop Mode  Another feature showcased about the Mate 10 series is how the device can be used as a desktop just by connecting a cable, rather than Samsung’s traditional dock system called Dex. This device can provide you more or less 3 hours of desktop experience all while using different applications.  Water Resistance   The Huawei Mate 10 Pro and Mate 10 Porsche Design now come with IP67 certification, i.e. the devices are now water and dust resistant for up to 1 meter and 30 minutes. It is really a bummer that the Mate 10 isn’t resistant against water and dust, but it does have an option to expand its storage up to 256 GB.  Android v8.0 Oreo  The new Huawei Mate 10 series are one of the first smartphones to run on the latest and greatest from Google – Android v8.0 Oreo. There is a new and improved EMUI 8.0 on top of the software.  Huawei Mate 10, Mate 10 Pro and Mate 10 Porsche Design Pricing  Huawei has priced the Mate 10 at €699 and the Mate 10 Pro at €799. The premium Mate 10 Porsche Design while comes with a staggering price of €1,395.

With Note 7 burning down in flames, we thought the days of Note series were over. But the new device comes with a bang en route to claim the title of the best Android smartphone right now. So what does the Note 8 hold that makes it so desirable and worth the exorbitant price of more than 1 lakh? We’ll talk about that in this review.  Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Specs Highlights   Display : 6.3 inches Super AMOLED Quad HD+ display with Gorilla Glass 5 protection  Resolution : 1440 x 2960 pixels (521 PPI pixel density)  OS : Android Nougat (7.1.1)  Chipset : Exynos 8895  CPU : 10nm Octa-core (4×2.3 GHz & 4×1.7 GHz)  GPU : Mali-G71 MP20  RAM : 6GB LPDDR4 RAM  Storage : 64GB internal storage, Expandable up to 256GB  Rear Camera : Dual 12MP (f/1.7, PDAF, 1/2.55″ sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size + f/2.4, AF, 1/3.6″ sensor size, 1.0 µm pixel size), autofocus, 2x optical zoom, dual-LED (dual tone) flash  Front Camera : 8 MP, f/1.7, 1/3.6″ sensor size, 1.22 µm pixel size  Connectivity : Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, A-GPS, NFC, 3G, 4G LTE, USB Type-C  Sensors : Iris scanner, fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, heart rate, SpO2  Other Features : Samsung Desktop Experience support, Bixby, HDR10 Compliant Display, IP68 Certified (Water and Dust resistant), Stylus, Wireless Charging  Battery : 3300mAh (non-removable) with Quick Charge 2.0  Price : Rs. 86,900   Design :   Galaxy Note 8 is the perfect mixture of metal and glass. The central metal frame acts as a bridge between two glass plates on the front and back giving it a seamless look. The glass body sure makes it look premium but it’s a fingerprint magnet. The phone is definitely tall with a 6.3inch display incorporating the elongated 18:9 aspect ratio. But unlike the S8’s, the phone has rectangular edges making it look boxier. But with a narrow width, the phone sure is easy to carry around even with a hefty weight of 195 grams.        Despite being a tall phone, the buttons are well placed but the dedicated Bixby button feels like a complete waste to me as it cannot be programmed for any other things. The baked-in one-handed mode proves to be of convenience on this tall display. The phone is unlike any other phones in the market and carrying it definitely feels a class apart. But you don’t always get to show the beauty of this phone in the wild, because, first it’s really slippery and second, if you drop it, the glass is very susceptible to cracks and scratches. So a cover is a must for this beauty.  Display   Samsung always has had the best display in their flagship and this time, it’s no different. It carries the best rated 6.3-inch Super AMOLED display which is HDR 10 compliant meaning, this is the sharpest display out there and viewing HDR content or anything on this display simply looks amazing. The infinity display pulls you right in for an immersive experience – if the video supports 18:9 aspect ratio. But the mono speakers don’t go well with the visual experience, I wished there were stereo speakers so I could enjoy the content even better. Also, there’s no audio DAC so the output from 3.5mm headphone jack is average.  The touch on this display is super responsive, so much so that everything feels like it’s floating. The display for battery reasons is tuned in to Full HD by default, to get the best display experience you have to switch onto the WQHD+ option. But this again is going to hit your battery life. Not to forget this is one of the brightest display out there with 1200 nits of brightness, so it can easily crush the direct sunlight. As an AMOLED display, Samsung has incorporated the always on display which allows you to peek on time, calendar and notifications. The display also holds a pressure sensitive home button which on hard press takes you to the home screen. And for protection, it comes with corning gorilla glass 5 which gets fewer scratches compared to the s7 edge in my experience.  S Pen   The only thing that makes Note a Note is the S Pen. Like the phone, S Pen is now IP68water and dust resistant so this expensive piece of hardware won’t get damaged easily. Talking about the S Pen features, the unlimited Off-screen memo is a great addition to jot down your notes on the go. It has very little latency so if painting and doodling is your thing, this might be the perfect pick. It can also translate text by selecting it. Samsung has also introduced Live Message feature with which you can doodle a GIF and share it with your friends. This feature is gimmicky and could have been better, plus it has very few colors to play around with.  There are conventional options for S Pen like Screen Write, Smart Select, and Create Note. S Pen, in my opinion, is very limited till now. This is already 8th iteration of the Note series and most of the S Pen features hasn’t evolved much and nor are there any 3rd party apps that utilize the S Pen that much. I wish it could do more than just write and draw.  Security   The Note 8 comes with few biometric security features. But first let’s start off with the basics, the phone offers a fingerprint scanner which is way up high on this tall device. It was really hard to reach first but with time I learned to juggle may hand just to reach the sensor perfectly. But still, this is the worst fingerprint placement on any smartphone.  Second, we have the facial recognition feature which is blazingly fast, and most often I turned on the phone even when I didn’t intend to so it was not a convenient feature for me. And lastly, we have the Iris scanner, which in my opinion is the perfect replacement for the awkwardly placed fingerprint sensor. It’s easy to register and unlocks your device in a jiffy. But for those wearing spectacles, this is again not convenient. Also, Iris scanner and face unlock allows only a single person to register which is great for security. You cannot enable face to unlock and iris scanner at the same time.  Battery   With a small 3300 mah battery, I was skeptical about the battery life of the device but on my test I found it to be above average. It’s not that great but you can make it till the end of the day. On my regular usage, I got around 4 hours of screen on time with the highest display setting(WQHD+). If you want more battery life, going all black on this AMOLED display sure helps. Note 8 comes with fast charging 2.0 which takes more than one and a half hour to fully charge the device.  With previous battery mishaps, Samsung has played safe with the slower charging standard. The device also comes with wireless fast charging. The previous generation of Notes was all about the battery but this time around it has failed to hit that mark properly.  Performance   Powering the Note 8 in Nepal is the Exynos 8895 octa-core chipset which is both powerful and power-efficient compared to Snapdragon 835. Normal navigation and the opening of apps are very fast. I never had issues of freezing and stuttering of apps or UI at all. Playing high-end games on this high-end crisp display with maxed out settings was simply amazing and for the device – well it was walk in the park. Gaming for a long time also didn’t result in any noticeable heating issues. Also with 6GB of RAM, I could switch between heavy titles without breaking a sweat. Also, you can use multi-window to use two heavy apps side-by-side. Galaxy Note 8 will live up to your expectations when it comes to performance.  Software                      Experience UI on the Note 8 is very minimalistic with not much going on. It feels light and swift without complexities like in the old Samsung phones. Everything is well organized in the settings menu so you easily find what you’re looking for. Notable software features of the phone include S Pen features and biometric security options which we’ve already talked about. But one unique feature for the Note 8 is the app pairing, this helps you to put together two apps you use side by side most often and for a phone that is made to multitask it’s a great feature. It comes with Galaxy Themes to customize the device to your liking by changing wallpapers, icon packs and so on.  The inbuilt Samsung notes prove to be a great app for doodling and sketching with loads of features to play around with. You also have the Secure Folder to secretly lock all of your important data from outside world. And the S Health app is something I look for in every device. I simply love this app. Not to forget we also get the edge panels with your quick contacts, apps, and tools which I found myself using the least. But the tragedy of app fragmentation still prevails, it has two apps for few things like two app stores, two browser apps and two email apps.  Camera   Note 8 is the first phone from Samsung to sport a dual camera setup. Both the camera sport 12MP sensor where the first sensor comes with f/1.7 aperture and the assisting telephoto lens offers f/2.4 aperture. Both the camera sports OIS so videos are smooth and the photos at night time are amazing. During daytime, typical of Samsung, the images are super saturated, details are well preserved and it has one of the best dynamic range. With the dual camera, you can now zoom into your subject without losing any quality. So either near or far from the subject, you’ll always get the best image possible. Also with dual camera, you can now take bokeh images with the live focus feature. You have to be 1.2 meters away from the subject to make it work, amount of blur can be adjusted right from the viewfinder or you can adjust it afterward from the gallery as well. The Live Focus Mode takes two pictures at once so you can zoom out of the bokeh mode to see the whole image as well. It’s a hit or miss feature and might not always give the best results but when it does work, the results are simply amazing.  The panorama stitching on the phone is super fast, once you complete taking panoramas, it is instantaneously available. You have manual controls but I like the default images the phone creates, apart from that, the phone offers slow motion, hyper-lapse, virtual shots and sticker camera filter like those of snapchat and Instagram. Note 8 can shoot full HD videos at 60fps which is my go-to mode or else it can also shoot 4k at 30fps. It can shoot Full HD at 60fps for only 10 minutes which might not be enough time to capture moments for everyone. Up front, it holds an 8MP camera which again is incredible. The selfies come out bright with high details and well-balanced colors. But mind this slippery phone while holding it with one hand for selfies. In short, this is the best smartphone camera I’ve used in a smartphone. Every image you take feels like images worth sharing which gets you clicking more images.  Connectivity   ON connectivity side of things, Note 8 offers hybrid sim slot where sim 2 is used for Micro SD expansion. It comes with dual-band wifi which supports gigabit speed. The wifi and network strength are strong so you’ll always have a reliable connection. On calls, the audio from the earpiece is loud and the clarity is maintained well. It also supports Bluetooth 5.0 so it can now be connected with more than one device at once. Samsung Pay feature is baked in but there’s no use for it here. For charging and data syncing, it comes with USB C port. And it offers all the sensors you could think of including, barometer, heart rate, and Spo2. But sadly there is no IR blaster which could have been a great addition.  Verdict   The Note 8 checks off all the boxes that make up a great smartphone. That raises the same question again, is it worth one lakh rupees? Well, it’s the premium built quality, the convenient S Pen features, and an awe-inspiring camera. There are very few things to complain about the Note 8 as you have to be very specific about its shortcomings based on your preference. For me, I think it wouldn’t be a compromise to opt for the S8 or the S8 plus would be a better purchase decision. Because for S Pen, if you are not a business professional or an artist, it’s hard to decide what you make use of the hardware, and for Dual Cameras, well it depends on deciding how often do you come with subjects that you need to zoom in. With S8’s you won’t be missing out on the great build quality and amazing camera, plus you would be saving 15% and 25% buying the S8 and S8 Plus respectively.

And helping Apple achieve this technical achievement is LG, who will create a foldable OLED panel for Apple. Now that LG showed us a working foldable prototype a few years ago, by 2020 this seems doable.  You might question Apple’s decision to choose  LG  over  Samsung . You would think that because they are working together now, but that’s just how businesses go, a very thin line of loyalty overshadowed by profit. Also, Apple says it’s “due to concerns over tech leaks” so let’s just go with that. Samsung will still continue to make OLED panels for Apple up until 2018. After that LG will take over, at least that is the plan for now.  The bigger question is, will 2020 be late for Apple to enter the foldable display market. Samsung already expects their first foldable smartphone to enter the market by next year. That a two-year head start over their arch-rivals. But we have seen Apple getting to the party a little later with a much better and improved technology, so high hopes for that.        We can come to a conclusion that Apple doesn’t want to collaborate with Samsung in any way. With Apple heavily invested on LG’s new plant that will fulfill all of Apple’s OLED need from 2019.

Ncell teaming up with the Malaysian VOD provider iFlix has introduced iFlix Service for its users.  iFlix is currently providing its services in more than 23 countries including Nepal. The company has teamed up with more than 150 studios to provide their TV Shows and Series. It even has a dedicated kids section with cartoon shows and movies.

Chatsim is world’s first SIM that lets its users connect to data connection anywhere in the world and use it for sending unlimited texts on selected internet messaging apps. It is currently operating in more than 160 countries through over 250 operators.  How Chatsim works:  Chatsim basically lets you send texts on Whatsapp, Messenger, BBM, Hike, WeChat, Telegram, Line, QQI and Kakao. The SIM users receive a phone number from Jersey – a British island. After popping in the SIM, customers will have to register their SIM number via Chatsim’s website. After registering, the SIM gets activated. Chatsim basically uses  Nepal Telecom’s  and  Ncell’s  network back and forth to provide their users a better network experience here in Nepal. So, you will never have to worry about it not working at a specific area.        Chatsim works with data roaming turned on.

As for sending multimedia contents, buyers will have to purchase extra credits just to make calls or send videos and photos through it.  It is, however, a bummer that Chatsim doesn’t support Viber – one of the most popular messaging platform in Nepal. But officials at Chatsim have confirmed that support for Viber is on the way.

Read what the CEO of Razer said back in June,  Right now I don’t see any mobile device or software platform that really fulfills the needs of the [mobile] gamer … there is a huge opportunity to disrupt the mobile market.  I fully agree with what he said. The last time someone launched a gaming-oriented smartphone was Sony with the Xperia Play. However good that phone was, it never got a sequel. There was also the Nvidia Shield, which was more like a tablet than a smartphone.        Razer announced the news with a tweeted quote “WATCH for our biggest unveiling… ” with a picture of a person using a handheld device which definitely isn’t another tablet since it looks a little too small to be a tablet.  On a side note, Razer did acquire the Nexbit System Inc – a smartphone company which had launched the popular  Nextbit Robin . We’ll have to see how much of an influence\xa0that will create for their\xa0new product.  The alleged\xa0smartphone will surely deliver a hardcore gaming experience its buyers.

With every newer generation of the Kindle, the price has also grown at a sizable pace. While the first Kindle cost $80, and the newest iteration is carrying a $250 price tag.  Kindle is also one of the first hardware that Amazon ever made, although that number has now that has grown to a few devices. The Creators of Kindle quote that they have already sold “tens of millions” of Kindle units, which isn’t a vague number at all.        Coming back to the new Kindle Oasis, it features a bigger 7-inch screen with a pixel density of 300ppi. Amazon claims that a few extra LEDs have been added to the screen which has made it much brighter than before.

You don’t? You think it is going to run the world in the coming years? Hold your thoughts for a while. The world has already found a true believer of Cryptocurrency and  Bitcoins  revolution in a 39 years old Netherlands native:\xa0 Didi Taihuttu.  Didi Taihuttu\xa0put everything that he owned up for sale- including his house, motorbike, electric bikes, children’s toys, clothes and shoes, \xa0his house up for sale; and went on to live in a campsite near Venlo in the Netherlands. What did he get in exchange of all this, you ask? Bitcoins and other crypto currencies is the answer. Yes, believing that bitcoins and blockchain technology are going to transform the role of money and banks in the society, Taihuttu took the leap. To quote him:  “People will say,’You’re crazy.’ But we are an adventurous family and are going to gamble for a moment to live minimalist lives. If you never take a risk, life is boring.”  But the step he took seems so much more than a risk, doesn’t it? Let’s delve more into how he has been living as of today.        Also Read: \xa0 Getting Started with Bitcoins: How to get Bitcoins?  Taihuttu and his wife shared that they had taken the decision to sell their possessions \xa0in the summer of 2017. He had been running his own company offering computer courses in Venlo for the past 11 years. Last year, after his father: John passed away, the family had a difficult time. Realizing that they had had enough, the family decided to go travelling. Hence, they sold the business and went on a nine-month world trip through Asia and Australia with their three daughters, from which they recently returned.  So, how did Didi Taihuttu come across crypto currency?   While he and his family were in the tour, they met a lot of people using digital coins. Didi added that in Bali, he had met a South African exchange trader who resigned after 17 years and went into crypto trading, and on the beach near Noosa in Queensland he spoke to someone from Dubai who was trading in bitcoins. Taihuttu said that he kept in touch with those people via Skype and analyzed the daily cryptomint trade. He added that these counterparts had a lot of experience in this sort of trading and also said that he himself had been aware of these coins since 2010, when it was worth less than one euro. In the current scenario, a single bitcoin is worth more than $4500 with the current valuation.  As he is an entrepreneur, he was encouraged to invest and work on bitcoins since the first time he learnt about them. He teamed up with a friend and set up a physical business to mint bitcoins after buying dozens of computers and video cards. And then, when the value of Bitcoins escalated to several hundred euros in 2013, he decided to sell the entire stock of coins. To this he says:  “If I had known then that four years later it would have been ten times more valuable, then of course I wouldn’t have sold everything. But then I thought: I have to make a profit.”  Afterwards, the value of Bitcoins plunged, his electricity and property rentals skyrocketed which prompted him to invest on\xa0Dogecoin, a smaller emerging currency. However, things became a bit different in the spring of 2017. Dogecoin’s value had soared to ten to twenty times its previous worth, Bitcoin’s value rose to $3,000, and other crypto currencies also followed suite. Also, the fact that he continued to meet so many Bitcoin traders on his family’s world trip was a sign for him to get back to minting crypto currencies.  Also Read:\xa0 What is Cryptocurrency? Money of the future?  Having to choose an entirely new lifestyle while pursuing his belief on crypto currency, the Taihuttu family had to get used to a chalet on a campsite instead of their luxury four-bedroom, 200-square-meter house. Taihuttu’s three daughters, who had a room each for themselves, now all bunk in together. The family says that they are still keeping other items on sale to buy as much Bitcoins as possible.  For how long will the Taihuttu family keep this going on?  The family will continue this way until 2020, at which point Taihuttu hopes Bitcoins and will be irreplaceable and his wealth will be worth three to four times as much.  But what if things go wrong?  To this, Didi Taihuttu says:  “Then we will be without money for a moment.

Although other devices were released in the keynote this is a big year for the iPhone and the Apple as it is already a decade since the release of the first iPhone. The new iPhones have stirred up speculations of the tech industry regarding the choice of a single iPhone between the three.  Don’t Miss:   Apple iPhone 8 and 8 Plus Price in Nepal  The design of iPhone has not changed since 2014 when Apple had launched the iPhone 6 with an aluminum unibody design. Apple now looks a lot less innovative with every release, all while Android devices are getting more innovative with software and hardware. We are living at a time where it is hard for any iPhone user to say that iPhone is the best smartphone there is. If it was any other time, the new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus would have been called the  iPhone 7s and 7s Plus  with a few upgraded specs and changes up its sleeve, as they share the same design with the previous iPhone. With the release of the hyped bezel-less iPhone X that will probably shadow the sale iPhone 8, it begs a question – why does iPhone 8 even exist?        Also Read:   Apple launches iPhone X   The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have glass bodies that feature wireless charging which looks like a fusion of the older iPhone 4 and iPhone 7. The new phones have what Apple calls the most durable glass in any smartphone with reinforced aerospace grade steel and aluminum frame. The iPhone 8 has 4.7-inch Retina HD display while the iPhone 8 Plus has 5.5-inch Retina HD display. Both the displays adopt true tone technology, which adapts the color temperature and intensity to ambient light. The devices feature the A11 Bionic chip, which is 20 – 70% faster than previous generation chipsets. The new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus have improved cameras that can take brighter and more vibrant photos than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The most noticeable change in iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus is the glass back to support wireless charging. Apple has chosen to go for Qi certified inductive wireless charging standard rather than for some proprietary standard charger.  Although the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus is considered as flagship devices by the Apple, the announcement of iPhone X with an edge to edge OLED display has cannibalized the sales and preorder of the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus. The display on the iPhone X has a resolution of 2436 x 1125 pixels on a 5.8-inch diagonal screen. The iPhone X also has HDR, 3D touch and True Tone Display like its brothers. The entire device is covered by the screen except for a notch that houses camera and sensors for the Face- ID among others.   To incorporate the entire screen, Apple had to make some sacrifices. It ditched Touch ID for Face ID. The company has put lots of interesting technology behind the notch for Face ID. Its sensors have TrueDepth system, which has an infrared camera that creates a 3D map of the face that, in turn, can even unlock your phone even in the dark. Face ID is powered by a dual-core neural engine that adapts to your face and prevents the phone to be unlocked by a photo of you. However, at the keynote, Apple failed to show the demonstration in their first try.  Don’t Miss:   iPhone Price in Nepal  Another problem that Apple fans have to deal with the new devices is their price. The price for the iPhone X is whopping $1000, around $300 more than the iPhone 8 and  Samsung Galaxy S8 . This price point has really confused customers whether to wait for the iPhone X that will be in store on November 3, go for cheaper variants of the iPhone or switch to android.  So, with the design that backs to 2014 and release of the more premium iPhone X, it is somewhat confusing. Why does iPhone 8 even exist and why should we buy iPhone 8 or 8 Plus rather than iPhone X?

Just like the money we use are pieces of paper, Bitcoins are just bits of data. \xa0Bitcoin system works based on people’s belief that it is worth something. Bitcoin is just a ledger with amount assigned to an address which goes up and down based on the transactions you do.  History:  Bitcoin came into existence in 2009 with the need for a secure and transparent transaction system. When people transacted money over the internet, they go through some centralized system like Banks and they used to take a fair amount of the money for the transaction. If the transaction was international it could take days and cost more. \xa0Also, you had to completely trust the bank for your security which stored all your transaction details.  How do Bitcoins work?         Bitcoin users peer-to-peer network which is same as how Bit-Torrents work. Bitcoin isn’t controlled by any central authority, it’s a community managed network. Trading Bitcoin, on the surface, is as simple as sending text over the internet, but the underlying crypto measures make it much safer, faster and efficient.  An individual’s Bitcoins are stored in Bitcoin wallet, and anyone having hold of the Bitcoin wallet has a private key which is kept secret. That key is used to sign/encrypt the transaction. For every transaction, the users have a unique public address which is just a random hash. One can have as many addresses as they want and it’s always a good thing to change addresses for different transactions to maintain anonymity.  When a transaction is initiated, the sender creates a packet of data which has the sender’s public address, amount sent and the receiver’s public address. The packet is encrypted by the sender’s private key which signs the packet with a digital signature(different every time and adds a mathematical problem to it.  When a packet is sent, it is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network is full of Miners who manages the Blockchain.  Blockchain: Public Ledger that keeps the record of all the bitcoin transactions.  Miners: People who verify the entry in the blockchain.  The package needs to be verified first by the Miners to get through the network to the receiving end. This includes checking of the  transaction standard  and solving mathematical problems attached to the packet. After the transaction is verified and done, then the transaction record is saved as a block of data in the block chain. It takes an average of 10 mins to verify the transaction.  The Blockchain doesn’t contain cumulative transaction record of a single public address. It just has the record of each transaction.  Bitcoin is divisible. You can divide a single bitcoin into multiple pieces and use them separately.  Example:  If you have one Bitcoin which is worth Rs.10,000 and you need to pay for a USB Drive that is Rs.3,000. Then you can break the single bitcoin and take Rs.3,000 out of it to pay for the USB Drive.  Bitcoin Mining  Source: Bitcoindaily  When users transact in Bitcoin, there’s mathematical problem attached to it and if someone can solve that problem, they are awarded Bitcoin. This is the basics of how Bitcoins are created. There cannot be more than 21 million Bitcoins and as of June 1st, 2017 there are already 16,366,275 BTC in existence. We’ll reach the 21 million mark by the year 2140.  Bitcoin mining ensures the authenticity of the transactions being carried out. More the Bitcoin miners, faster the transactions will take place. Mining requires powerful computers to solve the mathematical problems. Usually, high powered GPU’s were used for solving problems but they require a lot of electric power. And Power consumption is one of the major cost of mining bitcoin. If the cost of your power consumption is higher than the reward you get from mining bitcoins, then it’s a loss!  But now there are Application Specific Integrated Circuit(ASIC) which are made for solving these mathematical problems faster and they consume less energy.  CPU < GPU<ASIC  How to get Bitcoins?   You can get Bitcoins by:   Mining it  Accepting Bitcoins in your Business  Buying it   Future of Bitcoin:   Bitcoin in a technical sense is just an application running on top of Blockchain protocol. There are other currencies being generated that use the Blockchain protocol like the  LiteCoin ,  PeerCoin ,  NameCoin  and  much more . Even if the Bitcoins run out or become unpopular these coins will hold the legacy and thrive towards a digital finance system that is transparent, cheaper, secure and faster.  Bitcoin is changing finance in the same way the web has changed publishing. Bitcoins are being accepted by a lot of big businesses and even governments now, which is helping to make Bitcoin mainstream. Once they become mainstream, it’ll ensure its other derivatives get the shed of light they need. So, it is almost certain that the Digital Currency or Crypto Currency is the future of finance. And work is being done on the protocol to make it more secure and autonomous to prepare it for the future.  Also Read:\xa0 What is Cryptocurrency?

['Samsung has dibs on Snapdragon 845 chip for Galaxy S9'],"['Qualcomm', 'Samsung']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['October 11, 2017']",2017-10-11 12:23:47+00:00,"['The Samsung Galaxy S lineup has been one of the more successful smartphone series. In fact, the only other smartphone vendor that competes with Samsung is Apple. And here’s why it’s a bad thing.  The only manufacturer out the two\xa0that employes Qualcomm’s chips in their smartphones is Samsung. They also have their in-house Exynos processors to fall back on if Qualcomm ever fails to deliver. And we have seen it happen with the S6 and S6 edge series when the 810 SoCs failed on a few aspects of processing.  And when the Snapdragon SoCs actually worked, Samsung had dibs on the first batch of the 835 processors. It was for Samsung’s Galaxy S8 lineup for China and America. When this happened, all of the other manufacturers had to either fall back on their in-house\xa0SoCs (Huawei). For those that didn’t have an in-house SoC were forced to either wait (Sony) or use an older generation SoC (LG).        And the fact that it’s going to happen again with the Snapdragon 845 isn’t much of a motivation for others. Samsung will basically employ the new SoC in the USA and Chinese variants of the Galaxy S9. And the same thing will repeat with other manufacturers forcing them to find other alternatives.  Why is this bad? Because Samsung’s strategy to call dibs on SoCs even with their own set of in-house processors is disrupting the flagship release cycle for most manufacturers among other problems. This should needless to say stop but the galaxy phones are again one of the bigger clients for Qualcomm and if Samsung decides to tweak their SoCs and abandon Qualcomm, they will lose a lot of shipment\xa0volumes, which probably isn’t what Qualcomm wants either.  So what’s the conclusion to this? Nothing. As a consumer, we can do nothing and neither can the manufacturers. The options still remain for them to use other processor manufacturers like MediaTek\xa0but it would be too mediocre for expensive flagships. They can opt for in-house SoC production, but not all of them are equipped\xa0with enough resources to do so.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/s9.jpg']
['What is Cryptocurrency? Money of the future?'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['October 11, 2017']",2017-10-11 12:23:03+00:00,"['When people talk about cryptocurrencies, they usually refer to  Bitcoins . Bitcoins are one of the many forms of electronic currency. There are  Ethereum ,  Ripple ,  Litecoin ,  Monero \xa0and many other cryptocurrencies.\xa0Till date, there are about 700 Bitcoin-like currencies and they all hold\xa0different monetary values. So what exactly is a cryptocurrency? How can this reshape the future of our world economy?  Also Read:\xa0 Getting Started with Bitcoins: How to get Bitcoins?  How did cryptocurrencies originate?  In late 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown brain behind cryptocurrency, developed “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” also known as Bitcoin. A peer-to-peer network is a hub of computers for sharing files, videos or any other information (just like bit-torrent). Bitcoin was the first and also the most important cryptocurrency.         In previous years, digital cash took rapid economic growth since its evolution in the late 2000s. People started to use electronic card systems that provided more security than carrying paper currency. Banks, shopping malls, money exchange, and many other sectors use digital cash such as credit and debit cards for their daily transactions. But still, digital cash have their inadequacy.   Digital cash needs a payment network with account, balances, and transaction. A central authority like banks, take control over these transactions. The problem with this type of payment network is that customers had free will to double-spend. This means that one can spend the same amount twice or conduct any type of fraud. Therefore, a central server keeps the record of the balances and prevents the entities from double-spending.  But, a decentralized network does not allow exchanges or any other form of double spending. Thus, the network minimizes the threats of losing money and even fraud. Cryptocurrency allows money to transfer faster and costs much cheaper compared to other conventional methods. A decentralized network deploys a\xa0 blockchain technology  and\xa0does not have a central server or financial institutions. Instead, every account holder has a job to keep their records such as the date and time of a transaction, the number of participants involved and the amount. The history of transaction of a single user is stored in a block. These blocks share the records of financial transactions of every user and are mounted on a chain of other blocks.  What is a blockchain?  A blockchain contains all the accounting data\xa0of economic transactions, property and the record of every single trade that have occurred among users. It is a universal digital book or an online ledger. Users can also check whether a future transaction is valid or not through the blockchain. Since a blockchain\xa0technology does not have an imprint or physical validation of the transaction, the Internet stores this information. The information inside the block chain database is truly public and shared all over the internet. They exist as a shared and continually updated string of data, and these data are consistent with one another.\xa0Only the parties involving in the transactions can access and view the details. Consequently, duplicating or counterfeiting these data are impossible for some hackers.  A global network of computers that use blockchain technology manages the directory for each Bitcoin transaction and operates on a peer-to-peer basis, also known as a node. A node is a network of computers that create a blockchain. These networks use clients\xa0that perform the task of validation and record the transfer of coins from user-to-user. These nodes circulate the documentations throughout the Internet. Every computer in a node is an administrator of a blockchain that can join\xa0the network freely. Each of these administrators\xa0has a chance of winning Bitcoins.  What exactly is a cryptocurrency?  A form of digital money that use codes is a cryptocurrency. A universal ledger called a blockchain store the details of each transaction of these electronic coins. To hold access to the database, a user must realize some specific conditions called a private and a public key. Your bank account, money, and your transactions is a spreadsheet of a database on the internet. This data is stored in a ledger that has a network of servers called nodes, to keep track of your\xa0money.\xa0The blockchain preserves every transaction in the ledger and shares the details with several other users. It renders the Bitcoin users a form of proof-of-work or simply they trust their counterpart.  Who creates the cryptocurrencies?  A decentralized network does not have a central authority. Therefore, a cryptocurrency needs some mechanism to prevent anyone from using it. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use an SHA 256 Hash algorithm which stands for Secured Hash Algorithm 256-bit. A Hash is a string of strong cryptographic codes or functions (similar to binary 1’s and 0’s) that use hexadecimal codes.  Miners decrypt the SHA code using high-powered computers and strong mathematical calculations. The transaction adds to the blockchain after the miners decode the hash. C oinbase \xa0then provides the miners with a specific number of Bitcoin as a reward. This is how miners create valid Bitcoins. The number of people who use these coins for their daily administration set the value of Bitcoins. But for those who do not use these powerful processing chips, they can buy or sell Bitcoins through online exchanges like  Coinbase  or  LocalBitcoins . These bitcoins do not have an intrinsic value or any physical form. They just exist and possess a certain value.  Some famous cryptocurrencies in 2017 are:   Bitcoin   The first and the most famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin has a market cap that exceeds over $80 billion. A single bitcoin is worth more than $4500 with the current valuation. Its transaction volume has reached nearly 250,000 daily transactions. Some Cyber-crime agency like DarkNet uses Bitcoins as a global means of payment for illegal transactions.   Ethereum   Ethereum has ascended to the second position below Bitcoin in the hierarchy of cryptocurrencies. Other than Bitcoins, Ethereum not only allows transactions for existing accounts and balances but they also validate complex contracts and programs for corporate banks. Besides Ethereum, there is a host of cryptocurrencies like DigixDAO and Augur. They belong to a family of cryptocurrency of Ethereum. A single Ethereum coin is worth $300 in the current market.   Litecoin   Litecoin is one of the first cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin. They are faster than Bitcoins and take a larger amount of token with new mining algorithm. Users trade Litecoins excessively with one another. They use Litecoins as a backup for Bitcoins.   Monero   Monero uses a new type of algorithm (a cryptonite algorithm) that adds privacy features which were missing in Bitcoins. This type of algorithm introduced a concept of ring signatures. The ring signatures were able to pierce through the blockchain and secure the transactions. It was famous for the darknet marketers when the internet felons decided to use it as a currency.  Below you can find some of the best cryptocurrency apps that are free on Android Market:   Bitcoin Checker   Bitcoin Checker is the most popular app for users of cryptocurrencies and unveils the up-to-date prices on most cryptocurrencies.

['OnePlus is collecting user’s private data and here’s how you can disable it'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['October 11, 2017']",2017-10-11 04:46:49+00:00,"['OnePlus is somewhat a household name these days. The smartphone company is known for providing flagship devices for a budget price. With the motto of “Never Settle”, OnePlus has impressed its users with the devices in its arsenal. However, due to a lack of software support for its devices, the company came under huge criticism last year. That was again shunned by how the manufacturer cheated with the OnePlus 5 by manipulating benchmarks. This time OnePlus is back with another trouble as it looks like the company is collecting private data from their users without any permission.  This discovery was made by Chris Moore during a holiday hack challenge where he had used OWASP ZAP, a tool that can attack web applications. During the tests, he found an unfamiliar domain related to open.oneplus.net and decided to further investigate the matter He later discovered that this domain was collecting his private information related to his smartphone and sending it to Amazon Web Services, all without his knowledge and permission.  Here’s what the domain was circulating on Chris Moore’s OnePlus 2:         IMEI(s)  Mac Addresses  Phone numbers  Mobile networks names  Wireless network’s ESSID and BSSID  IMSI prefixes  OnePlus device’s serial number  Timestamp of when user locks and unlocks their device  Timestamp of when user opens and closes any application on their device  Timestamp when user turns his phone off and on   With these data, one can easily identify any user, and OnePlus is doing just that.  Chris Moore, in his article, says, “this kind of data collection, especially one containing information that can be directly tied back to me as an individual, should really be opt-in and/or have an easily accessible off switch.”  With series of tweets, Chris did report the issue to OnePlus Support but their response wasn’t encouraging.  Android Authority reached out to the company for comments and here’s how they responded:  ” We securely transmit analytics in two different streams over HTTPS to an Amazon server. The first stream is usage analytics, which we collect in order for us to more precisely fine tune our software according to user behavior. This transmission of usage activity can be turned off by navigating to ‘Settings’ -> ‘Advanced’ -> ‘Join user experience program’. The second stream is device information, which we collect to provide better after-sales support. “  Another representative has claimed that the company is doing this in order to provide a better after-sales service to its customers. Does providing after-sales service justify\xa0collecting a user’s private data without their permission?  It is really concerning that OnePlus isn’t taking this issue seriously enough. The company is already one of the big hitters in the smartphone world and issues like collecting unauthorized data can surely blemish its reputation. But what can you expect from a company which makes fake promises just to glorify its image?  Fortunately for us, there is a way this issue can be dealt with. An Android developer has brought forward a solution to disable this unauthorized data collection without even rooting your OnePlus device. Here’s is what you need to do:   Install ADB on your computer.  Click here for guide  After installing ADB and connecting it with your smartphone, open Command Prompt.  Type ADB Shell  Enter this command: pm uninstall -k –user 0 net.oneplus.odm  Success!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/oneplus-collecting-data-gbn.jpg']

They did share their good share of momentum, as well as a few dedicated fan following. We even thought that Windows Phone would finally pick up some pace when Microsoft bought Nokia’s smartphone division. But not much could fill the void of unsatisfactory app selection and a few other shortcomings.  Windows Phone has always had its own fan followings. The OS was also not that bad, with a smooth interface, regular updates, a clean UI and a bunch of features that their users loved. Microsoft even released one OS for all the platforms hoping for a better adoption rate. And the acquisition of Nokia and Lumia division wasn’t much less than a sold try from Microsoft’s point of view.  With the OS market share plummeting to less than 0.2% it was all but sure that Microsoft was going to take an action to kill their Windows Phone division. And they did, with a  tweet  from Joe Belfiore, VP of Microsoft OS confirmed Windows Phone OS’s death.        The tweet mentions clearly that no new features will make it’s way to the WP OS. Also, no new hardware will feature the Windows Phone OS either. He does mention that the platform will still get bug fixes and security updates, which we hope lasts as long as possible.  The biggest reason was clearly the fact that developers never backed up the platform. “We have tried very hard to incent app devs,” explains Belfiore. “Paid money.. wrote apps 4 them.. but volume of users is too low for most companies to invest.”  Even Bill Gates ditched Windows Phone for an Android, the Galaxy S8 if you were wondering. That’s also because, with the downfall of windows, Microsoft started to support Android OS a bunch of the Microsoft apps which enabled users to easily switch to the platform. YOu can basically find all of the apps from Microsoft available and well optimized for Android.  With Microsoft heavily invested in Android and iOS, the Windows Phone users won’t have much of a hard time adapting to other platforms.

Not just that, they have also earned the reputation of getting some of the best features of the Samsung flagship.   The Samsung Galaxy A5 is one of the most loved smartphones among the bunch. Maybe due to its smaller form factor on a premium packaging, people seem to love this one. This year Galaxy A5 2018 is getting the newer  Snapdragon 660 CPU  and the even newer unreleased Exynos 7885 (in Nepal/India). This processor improvement will be a huge one, seeing how the past A series SoCs barely ever got an upgrade.        For the even bigger news, looks like Samsung has finally found the answer to the most criticized part of their 2017 flagship lineup, the  fingerprint sensor  placement. Yes, its finally going to be located below the rear camera. And with the A series also getting the bezel-less treatment this year, looks like the fingerprint sensor is finally getting a more viable placement,\xa0below the camera. Until they find a way to put it inside the display of course!  The 2018 A series will also be getting the bezel-less treatment this year with  infinity Display . It’s only going to be a 1080p panel at 1080 x 2220 to be exact thanks to the 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The new 2018 series will have to wait on the dual camera setup that we saw on the Note 8, most probably reserved for the 2019 A series. And like always, the smallest of the bunch, Galaxy A3 might miss out on some of the new features.                Another feature the new A series will inherit is the  Bixby Virtual Assistant . Just like the flagships, the A series will also feature a dedicated Bixby button on the left, which will direct you straight to Bixby. You also have an option to disable the button altogether this time around.  So, what do you think of these upgrades to the A series smartphones from Samsung? With these newer devices getting a much needed SoC upgrade, the new bezel-less design, and a 18:9 display, has Samsung upped their game in the premium midrange segment?

['eSewa App Review: An Ultimate Online Payment Gateway in Nepal?'],"['Apps', 'Reviews']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 6, 2017']",2017-10-06 05:23:31+00:00,"['With the progression in technology, we can see lots of innovations designed and developed to facilitate the humans. Smartphones are one of such great inventions. Smartphones, the already prolific innovation is nowadays linked with the ingenious software approach to making its use even more versatile. And the concept of mobile wallets/digital wallets/E-wallets is one of them. And in the matter of digital wallets, eSewa is the most heard and most used digital wallet in Nepal, which has been uprising to develop itself as an ultimate online payment gateway in Nepal.  eSewa had been conceived by eSewa FonePay Private Limited in 2009 AD. Since then the company has been striving to lure people into a fast, safe, hassle-free and cashless transaction. And with the popularity and the services it has offered, it has now managed to garner hundreds of thousands of users. In addition, with the mobile money license provided by the Nepal Rastra Bank, it has been able to expand its horizon and has also managed to create an upsurge in users’ trust.  In this article, we will be reviewing eSewa, the most used and trusted digital wallet in Nepal along with the services it has offered to develop itself as an ultimate online payment gateway in Nepal.        User Interface (UI)  The user interface of e-Sewa is clean and easy. Users are offered an easy switching between SMS Mode and GPRS Mode. SMS Mode can be used to make transactions, where there is no prominent internet connections. And all the services offered are stacked on the whole screen in each mode so that users can find the services they seek at ease.  Responsiveness and Load Time  The app loads swiftly and each button on the app responds quickly as they are tapped. However, while performing some transactions, the app requires a strong internet connection to check scope and availability of the transaction and seems to be sluggish.  Usability  eSewa is offering a wide range of applications and seems to be expanding even more. They have a mobile app to offer convenience in transactions. However, transaction via an app is not mandatory. Users can also use the services via SMS. Furthermore, eSewa not only offers free services (except for khanepani bill payment) but also offer cash back on the transactions. And the rewards on every transaction has doubly lured the users to use eSewa.  Services Offered by eSewa     Fund Transfer:\xa0 With this service, the users will be able to send e-sewa money to other e-Sewa users  School Fee Payment:\xa0 e-Sewa has partnered with some schools and Montessori.

These companies accept payment via e-Sewa offering an online purchase of air tickets.  Buying Products Online in Nepal: \xa0 Stores and shopping malls have been accepting e-Sewa payments for online purchases. Some of the stores are also offering discounts on such purchases.  Recharges and Top Ups: \xa0Postpaid and prepaid NTC/Ncell/CDMA users can top up their balance via e-Sewa. DTH service providers like Dish Home and SimTv also accept payments via e-Sewa. Payment through e-Sewa is also accepted by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like NT ADSL, Worldlink, Vianet, Broadlink, Net Max, Hons, Subisu, Websurfer, and Itel.  Paying Utility Bills and Subscriptions:\xa0 This service includes payment of utility bills like telephone bills (NT Landline), Electricity Bills/NEA Payment (Currently limited to Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara), water bills/Khanepani Payment (currently limited to Lekhnath Small Town Water Supply, Pragatinagar Khanepani, Damauli Khanepani and Prithvi Narayan Khanepani), Newspaper Subscription, etc.  Send/Receive Remittance: \xa0e-Sewa has also been acting as a media to send and receive remittance. eSewa has also collaborated with the Western Union as an exclusive digital remittance partner.  Credit Card Payment: \xa0e-Sewa accepts credit card payments for the following banks: Nabil Bank, Global IME Bank, NMB Bank, Prabhu Bank, Laxmi Bank, Citizens Bank, NIC Asia Bank, Sanima Bank, Kumari Bank, Siddhartha Bank, Prime Commercial Bank.

Some Additional Services:\xa0 eSewa can also be used to recharge  Tootle  balance and Onver Smart Taxi. In addition, it has collaborated with different transport companies for online bus ticket booking. Furthermore, users can also make their Insurance Premium, EMI, Finance and Antivirus Payment via eSewa.  Service Cash Backs :  e-Sewa has been offering cash backs on various transactions. The cash back offered by e-Sewa on different services are tabulated below:        Type of Service  Cash Back Percentage (%)    Ncell Top-up  2.0    NT Postpaid Top-up  2.3    NT Prepaid Top-up  2.3    NT ADSL top-up – Volume Based  2.0    NT ADSL top-up – Unlimited  2.0    NT Landline Payment  2.3    Khanepani Bill Payment  Rs. 5  (Charge)     13.  eSewa Nepal Banks:\xa0 e-Sewa has partnered around 50 banks. These banks have facilitated the e-Sewa users to draw the bank money into an eSewa account and depositing the e-Sewa fund into the banks. Some of the banks are mentioned below.     Ace Development Bank Limited  Bank of Kathmandu Lumbini  Citizens Bank International  Everest Bank    Excel Development Bank  Gandaki development Bank  Garima Bikas Bank  Global IME Bank    Gurkhas Finance  Janata Bank  Jyoti Bikas Bank  Kailash Bikas Bank    Kamana Bikas Bank  Kanchan Development Bank  Kumari Bank  Laxmi Bank    Machhapuchchhre Bank  Mahalaxmi Bikas Bank  Manaslu Bikas Bank  Mega Bank Limited    Mission Development Bank  Muktinath Bikas Bank  Nabil Bank  NCC Bank    Nepal Bangladesh Bank  NIC Asia  OM Development Bank  Prabhu Bank    Prime Commercial Bank  Purnima Bikas Bank  Rastra Banijya Bank  Reliable development Bank    Sajha Bikas Bank  Sanima Bank  Sewa Bikas Bank  Shangrila Development Bank    Shine Resunga Development Bank  Siddhartha Development Bank  Sunrise Bank  Tinau Bikas Bank    Tourism Development Bank  Tribeni Bikas Bank  United Finance  Yeti Development Bank     Verdict  Carrying bulky wallets or purses not only bring inconvenience when carried but also acts as an invitation to the pickpockets. So going cashless and making payments through the eSewa not only offers fast and convenient transactions but also safety from the theft of wallets and purses. The users of eSewa are also privileged with offers, bonuses and discounts on the payments through eSewa. Since it has garnered a comparatively higher number of users (as compared to other Nepali mobile wallets), fund transfer among the eSewa users will not be at all difficult. So the use of eSewa seems to be a wise. However, the scope of eSewa is limited. All the banks and travel agencies have not entirely accepted eSewa as the payment gateway for their protocol. And outside Kathmandu Valley, the scope of eSewa is even constricted.  So it would be better if eSewa expands its scope with increased services and all the services widespread all over Nepal. If eSewa reaches that benchmark, eSewa will definitely be the ultimate online payment gateway in Nepal.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/esewa-nepal-review.jpg']
['Popular Smartphone Myths and the Facts Behind it'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['October 6, 2017']",2017-10-05 22:55:07+00:00,"['Smartphones myths are increasing day by day like every other tech gadgets. So in this article, we’ve tackled widespread smartphone myths existing right now and hopefully, you will be able to\xa0know the true facts that really matter.  Myths Regarding Camera  More megapixels means better camera   We usually think more megapixel will result in a better picture quality, but megapixel is not one the factor that determines the picture quality of a smartphone. Factors like what type of sensor, sensor size,\xa0Lens quality, Focal Length, image stabilization, etc play a bigger role in determining the quality of the camera. Megapixels only tell you the number of pixels the picture is made up of, and nothing more. For eg., Samsung Galaxy S7’s 12MP camera will take a way better picture than other midrange phones with a 13MP camera.        Learn more about  smartphone camera terms here .  Myths Regarding Performance  More cores mean better performance   More cores can never guarantee better performance. Although More cores will provide better multitasking experience, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will perform better single task operation. Other factors like CPU architecture, frequency at which the cores are operating, the processor manufacturer, nm process, Graphics processing unit, etc. determines the speed and performance of your smartphone. For instance, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core CPU performs better than most of the octa-cores Mediatek processors like MT6753 and MT7655.  Read more here.  Task killer apps help to speed up smartphones  There is a myth that the closing all the apps or employing a task killer to do so enhances the smartphone performance. And it has been convincingly advertised that removing the background apps from smartphone RAM would free up RAM space resulting in an upsurge in smartphone speed. But in reality, these apps (except  Facebook ,  Instagram  or downloads, which runs even in the background) freeze in the background when not in use and uses only a tiny bit of memory.  These apps are cached in RAM because of which they open faster next time. And closing these apps does not bring an upsurge in smartphone speed and enhancement in its performance. Removing apps that are not in use from RAM rather result in a slower process when reopened and consumes more battery for the process. If a particular app is consuming an excessive RAM space then the smartphone is capable of shutting down the processes by itself to avoid the drop in speed and performance.  More RAM is better   With this myth among the smartphone users, manufacturers have gained the audacity to generously stuff more RAM on their products. Let me clear this misconception. More RAM is not always the better and it is not the sole factor the performance of the smartphone depends on. The way RAM is used and RAM speed is another thing to be considered. Alongside, RAM optimization in the smartphone also comes into play for the performance. So, blindly running for the smartphones with more RAM is a mere consequence of digital superstition.  Myths Regarding Smartphone Battery   Bigger battery capacity means better battery life  This is necessarily not true. Battery life of a smartphone depends on other components like screen size, its resolution, what kind of processor, etc. For eg., Samsung Galaxy S6 features a Quad HD display and a high powering octa-core processor, and hence it’s battery life is not that great despite having a 2500mAh battery. On the contrary, Moto G3’s 2470mAh battery only has to power an HD display and a low powering quad-core processor, and hence, it’s battery life is better than the Galaxy S6.  Charging smartphone all night will destroy the phone   Battery and charging technologies have improved over the years, and charging your smartphone all night will not destroy your phone. Older batteries and charging technique were not smart enough to understand when they are full, and overcharging them consistently led to decreased battery life over time. Today’s charging mechanisms, however, are smarter. Once your phone is fully charged, it stops drawing electricity.  Only use the charger that came with the smartphone   It is one of the gimmicks used by smartphone OEMs to encourage to use only the products produced by them. As long as the charger is good in quality and if the capacity matches (rated voltage and current), there is no harm in using any other chargers. And using the chargers with lower voltage and current rating does not harm either. The only change will be the charging process gets slower as compared to the charging with original charger. However, the reverse is not true. Using a powerful charger (Quick or Dash charger) does not speed up the charging process. Smartphones are ‘smart’ enough to draw only the required amount of voltage and current during the process. However, because of the stress due to overvoltage and current, the battery may degrade over time.  Charging phones via data cables damages the battery in the long run  In the smartphone world, it is rumoured that charging phones via data cables to a laptop or a PC damages the smartphone battery. But in reality, charging via data cables does not do any harm on the smartphone batteries. Since the output of the laptop/PC is low, it charging process could be slow. But the harm on the batteries is entirely codswallop.  Automatic brightness saves battery  Smartphones these days come with a light sensor that helps the screen to adjust its brightness according to the surrounding. Auto brightness is definitely a useful feature since adjusting the display brightness every time is a bothersome task. However, this feature does not make a significant contribution in prolonging the battery backup. The reason is that, with this feature activated, the sensor consumes more power on communicating with the processor to adjust the display brightness.  Enabling Wi-Fi/Bluetooth uses a significant amount of battery power   Disabling the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth does not make a significant change in battery backup. Leaving the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth on does not drain the battery as long as there is no data transfer. The transmitter does need the power to function and make a search. However, the power required for such purposes is negligible resulting an insignificant change in battery life.  It does not matter when or how long you charge your smartphone battery  Taking light snacks time to time is better than starving and overeating. That goes true with the smartphone batteries. So discharging the battery to 0% and charging is to 100% cannot be considered good. Having smartphone battery below 20% and charging the battery over 80% creates stress on the battery. These stresses degrade the battery over time. So maintaining the smartphone battery within 20% to 80% is considered ideal.  Myths Regarding Smartphones’ Security  Android being an Open Source is prone to exploits   Although Open source software is open\xa0and giving access to the security layers of the OS could lead to exploits, but Android as an operating system is still remarkably secure. However, the apps that you download from unknown sources and outside of the Google store are more susceptible to malware exploits.  Any other myths you like to add? Don’t hesitate to comment below.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/myth-vs-fact-in-smartphones.jpg']
['Google Pixelbook convertible laptop with ChromeOS Launched'],"['Android', 'Google', 'Google Pixel']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['October 5, 2017']",2017-10-05 08:52:38+00:00,"['Google announced the Google Pixelbook yesterday. It is the first laptop from Google. With top of the line specs, lag-less performance, secure, and support for Android apps, this Chromebook promises a lot more.  Google Pixelbook:  The Google Pixelbook sports a 12.3-inch 1440p touch display with a 3:2 aspect and a pixel density of 235. The laptop will be available in three different versions:      Price    Processor    Storage    RAM     $999  Core i5 (7th gen)  128GB  8GB    $1,199  Core i5 (7th gen)  256GB  8GB    $1649  Core i7 (7th gen)  512GB  16GB     With the 8th generation of Intel processor out, we were expecting these specifications. The laptop features a 4 in 1 design, which basically means it has a 360-degree hinge that rotates all the way. Google says even the tablet mode feels comfortable in hand due to the small size, thin chassis, and a really lightweight build.        With a thickness of 10mm and a weight of less than 1 Kg, this laptop is definitely on point, not to mention the great build quality and an arguably a great looking design. The Google Pixelbook also features a backlit keyboard with 0.8mm travel distance and a glass trackpad.  Also read:   Google Pixel 2 Launched  Talking about its battery, the Pixelbook doesn’t disappoint. Google claims that their laptop is capable of delivering 2 hours of mixed usage from just 15mins of charge. And if you happen to fully charge the laptop, you can comfortably get up to\xa010 hours of battery life from the 41Whr battery. The laptop comes with a 45 Watt charger in the box.  The Chromebook was solely targeted at a small demographic of users at the start, which included students and budget buyers. But with the Pixelbook they are clearly targeting someone who would otherwise buy something like an XPS 13 or even a MacBook. Google expects a much larger subset of people to get excited about it.  So why buy an expensive Pixelbook instead of a Windows or a MacOS machine? We will leave that up to the potential buyers to decide but the new Pixelbook has a lot going for itself. For one, all your Android apps now run on the huge 12-inch screen, that includes everything from Asphalt 8 to Instagram. Basically, the laptop can run any Android app other than the ones that are in their beta phase.  The Pixelbook also supports Google Assistant. With either a dedicated Google assistant key or using the magic words “OK Google” you can quickly reach your digital assistant with ease. This might not mean much now but with every update to the Google assistant, it will definitely get much better and much more usable. Plus Google has added four microphones to the laptop which will definitely help with the Google Assistant’s hearing abilities.  If you own a pixel phone, the Pixelbook also supports direct automatic tethering and automatic unlock. Although the laptop doesn’t have a fingerprint sensor which could be a disappointment for most, we couldn’t care less.  Coming back to the build, port selection of the Google Pixelbook includes 2 USB-C and a headphone jack. It also houses a 720p camera, 2 speakers and Bluetooth 4.2  Also read:  Google Home Max and Mini launched  The Pixelbook will get automatic updates directly from Google. The app selection will also improve with Snapchat and Netflix joining the optimization train that already includes Adobe and Microsoft. Plus, thanks to the enormous spec bump, ChromeOS no longer needs a constant internet connection which is great.  Google Pixelbook Pen  The Pixelbook Pen is a stylus that you can use to draw or navigate on your Pixelbook. The pen weighs in at around 0.05lbs that is 22 grams and has a dimension of 5.79*0.42 inches. The Pen has a 2000 level pressure sensitive tip and a 60-degree angular awareness. Google also claims a latency of 10ms which is good. The Pixelbook and Pixelbook Pen work together with a few machine learning algorithms to reduce latency and increase palm rejection.   The Pixelbook Pen carries a price tag of $99 which seems reasonable seeing how the competition has priced their respective pens and pencils, although a lower price tag could have made it even better.  Conclusion  The Google Pixelbook is already up for  preorder  and shipping will start from 31st October. The dates are applicable for the US, UK, and Canada, so who knows how long it will take to finally reach Nepal, if ever. The more important question is this: is a laptop running\xa0ChromeOS worth as much as a high-end Windows machine or a slightly older MacBook?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pixelbook-feature.jpg']

This was a big change then as the company from California has had an unconditional love for software. Fast forward a year, Google launched a few products during an event yesterday. It unveiled the Pixelbook,  Google Home Max and Mini ,  Google Pixel Buds ,  Google Clips camera , and more importantly the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL.  https://youtu.be/zpLVsR8cSFo  The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL certainly managed to turn some heads as the search giants opted to talk about its software and Artificial Intelligence rather than the hardware side. Neat, right?        The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL come with Google’s latest and greatest offering, Android Oreo, right out of the box. It features with and redecorated Pixel launcher that now has a cleaner user interface. But the USP of both the devices, at least for me, is certainly the camera. Measuring 12.3-megapixel, the cameras on the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have a record high DxO Mark score of 98. Just recently the iPhone 8 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 scored 94 in that test.   The camera sensor on these devices works along with machine learning to capture pictures with field-of-depth like that in the flagship devices of today. Even the front-facing 8-megapixel camera can capture pictures in ‘portrait mode’. The camera has f/1.8 aperture and is engraved with the much necessary Optical Image Stabilization and Electronic Image Stabilization. It can shoot videos in 4K as well.  Display wise, the Google Pixel 2 shows off a 5.0-inch full HD display with some large bezels on the top and bottom. The higher variant, Pixel 2 XL, flaunts a near bezel-less display with 18:9 aspect ratio and quad HD quality. The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are both powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC coupled with 4GB of RAM.        1  of 2               Pixel 2         Pixel 2 XL                  The one thing I am disappointed by is the lack of headphone jack on the devices. Last year, during the launch of Pixel and Pixel XL, Google had mocked Apple’s decision to remove the beloved headphone jack from their smartphones.  Nonetheless, the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are the best devices for Android purists. It has the ‘Active Edge’ feature which triggers Google Assistant by a squeeze on the sides and a 3,520 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 functionality. The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are splash resistant and support unlimited storage on Google Photos. The smartphones’ camera supports AR stickers which were neatly demonstrated with Eleven from Stranger Things killing off the series’ Demogorgon. Both the devices feature dual front-firing speaker, a rarity on smartphones these days.  Source: Android Police  The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL come in three colors: black, kinda blue and white. The price of Pixel 2 starts at $649 while the Pixel XL comes in at $849 with prices reaching up to $949. Since there’s no distributor of Google Pixel devices in Nepal, we might not see its official launch here, however, the devices might be available unofficially with a slightly inflated price rate. Expect the Pixel 2 and 2 XL to cost around 25% more compared to the US pricing.

['Google Launches Home Mini and Home Max Speakers with Google Assistant'],"['AI', 'Android', 'Google', 'Google Pixel']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['October 5, 2017']",2017-10-05 06:50:52+00:00,"['Google’s #madebygoogle event was an exhilarating ride for us tech enthusiasts. While most of the companies are grasping the consumer’s attention with flashy and gimmicky features, Google is being more practical and looking ahead in the future. They are pushing AI first in everything and it is literally everything Google produces from now on. One of the most interesting things with AI incorporated were the Google Home Mini and Google Home Max smart speakers. Both are powered by the Google Assistant and will go head to head with the likes of Amazon Echo, Amazon Dot, and Apple Home Pod.  Google Home Mini:   Google Home Mini is one of the most affordable product from Google’s event with the price tag of just US$49. It is utmost minimal and small and can be placed in any corner of your home. More of these can be used in multiple rooms as you can broadcast messages to other speakers from a speaker.        It is covered in fabric to go well with the homely environment. The aesthetics are pleasing with a circular design and subtle colors. There are four lights on the top to indicate the Google Home Mini is listening or thinking. You can adjust the volume by tapping on the sides of the speaker and there’s a mute switch on the back. You can play and pause music by tapping on the center of the speaker. With its circular design, it is capable of producing 360degree sound.   According to Google, Google Home Mini sounds better than the Amazon Echo Dot and it’s loud as well. Google Home Mini uses MicroUSB and it doesn’t seem to tick the innovation Google is aiming for, but then again, it’s cheap.  Google Home Max:   Google Home Max is where the real AI comes into play. Along with Google Assistant, it comes with Google’s Machine Learning called Smart Sound. It basically adapts the sound from the speaker based on your environment. With its intelligent equalizer, the speaker identifies the type of audio you’re listening to, like songs, news or podcast and provides the best audio possible for those content. Wherever you place the speakers, either in the corner or the center of the room, it identifies those areas and provides an unadulterated sound experience. It listens to itself and adjusts accordingly to your settings. As an example, the Google Home Max lowers the audio in the morning and whenever you’re running a motor or your dog is barking in the background it automatically loudens the audio. And even with loudest of sound, your faintest “ok google” will be detected by the Google Home Max.   It comes in a rectangular form factor with minimal design. It can be placed either vertically or horizontally with the use of its magnetic base plate. It comes with two 4.5-inch-high excursion woofers and custom tweeters that can easily cover a large living area. You can connect it with Bluetooth or use a direct aux cable. Google Home Max is 20 times powerful than last year’s Google Home in terms of audio. It luckily comes with USB C. But the Google Home with all its futuristic features isn’t that cheap. The feel of sci-fi in your home comes with the price of US$399 and with that, you get YouTube Music Ad Free for 12 months.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Google-Home-Mini-and-Google-Home-Max-features-price-specs.jpg']
['Google Clips Launched: A smart hands-free camera that takes pictures all by itself'],['Google'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 5, 2017']",2017-10-05 05:12:28+00:00,"['We all want our precious moments to be framed forever inside photographs and videos, which helps us to relive such moments whenever wanted. But all that need is a good photographer/videographer. In addition, some of such special moments are so abrupt making it impossible to grab a camera and shoot the moment. But, no worries, Google has brought the solution for such scenarios in the form of Google Clips.  Google Clips is a smart hands-free camera that is capable of taking pictures all by itself. In its miniature size of 2 square inches, is the lens, sensor and clever sets of algorithms to define exact moment to capture, simply making it smart. Furthermore, Google Clips is quite unlike the digital cameras or action cameras as it lacks a viewfinder. The device also lacked shutter button when conceived, which, however, can be found in its final state.  “We used to not have a button”, Eva Snee, the user experience lead for the camera explained. “And then we put a button in because we learned from real users- outside of Google- that a camera needs to have that agency.”  A smart-camera named Clips, the nomenclature sounded confusing. But contrary to the other cameras, which capture photos or videos, Google Clips records snippet or motion pictures. As such snippets lack sound (since the Google Clips lacks microphone), such snippets are termed as clips. The clips are several seconds long, which can be exported as Motion Photos, GIFs, JPEGs or movie files. Since the device captures such snippets in 15fps frame rate, a high resolution still image can even be extracted from the snippet.        The device features machine learning and it gets acquainted with the faces that come frequently on the frame. The device gets gravitated to such people and takes their shots more often. The device is designed especially to work on kids and pets (cats and dogs). And according to the Google Clips team, the device worked seamlessly with the designated demographics and also worked well with goats.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXh1yyvXpwo  In terms of specs, Google Clips inherit 12MP sensor with a 130-degrees field of view. It also with silicone clips so that one can place it somewhere wanted to define the field of view. It also comes with 16GB of inbuilt storage and an inbuilt battery to power the device.  The device is priced $249 and is currently flagged as “coming soon”.

['Google Pixel Buds headphone with Real Time Language Translation Announced'],"['AI', 'Android', 'Google', 'Google Pixel']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['October 5, 2017']",2017-10-05 04:46:42+00:00,"['At its annual event held yesterday (October 4th, 2017), Google launched an array of other products besides the flagships: Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Among those products,  Google Pixel Buds  are also one. What exactly has Google put forward as Pixel Buds? Here’s more below:  These trademarked set of wireless headphones from Google are connected by a rope-like cord that goes around your head or neck and can be used for more than just listening. These ear-buds can be monitored using a touch-sensitive control on the right bud that allows users to tap to play/pause music, swipe forward and back to change volume and also offers a connection to Google Assistant on long press.         Now why connect to Google Assistant, you ask? This connection will offer users a communication channel through which the Google Assistant can read out notifications and messages to you. Moreover, this will also allow users to activate their own personal Google on-the-go by communicating their needs to the Google Assistant. The connection is also pretty simple. All the user needs to do is open the case and a Pixel Smartphone or any other Android phone with version 7.0 Nougat software and Google Assistant will connect them automatically.   Also, these Pixel Buds are worn in a unique way. As these are ear-buds, not in-ear headphones, they don’t fit into your ear canal and instead nestle into your outer ear and stay anchored in place by a small loop formed by the cord. In the event yesterday, Product Manager: Adam Champy explained how Google did not like the way in-ear headphones force users to handle the sizing of the buds. He further went on to add how users are asked to either take the headphone apart or put something in their ears that didn’t fit. Coming back to what he had to say about the Pixel Buds: “The loop here fits into a non-sensitive part of the ear and the whole system is stable enough to go running with.”  The most intriguing feature of the Pixel Buds is the integrated Google Translate feature. This feature was demoed on stage yesterday at the launch event where two Pixel Bud wearers: a native English speaker and a native Swedish speaker held a conversation with one another in their native language by translating communications in real time. There was barely any lag time between the speaker saying the words, the Buds’ hearing them and translating them into the appropriate language. Using the existing Google Translate data and infrastructure, the Pixel Buds are able to comprehend conversations in over 40 different languages.   Now speaking in terms of battery power and charging, the Buds come with a 120mAh battery and the cloth-covered charging case is of 620mAh. Google says that they should last about five hours on a charge. The company claims that the case will beam up to 24 hours of listening time on the Buds. Available in Just Black, Clearly White and Kinda Blue color variants, these Pixel Buds are available now for pre-orders in the USA priced at $159.  This is Google’s attempt at letting people get more done and stay connected without having the need to look at their Android smartphones. Also, needless to say, multilingual! What is your say about Pixel Buds? Do let us know in the comments below. We will keep you posted on these once they are available in the country.

['Understanding Camera Terms'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['October 4, 2017']",2017-10-04 09:45:43+00:00,"['With the passage of time, memories are faded and beautiful moments tarnish from our mind palace. To archive such memories, the cameras were introduced. However, the photos taken by cameras are photographer dependent. Photographer, lacking the knowledge or skills of photography will capture shaky, blur and less vibrant images.  There are many devices available that can take photos; be it a smartphone, digital camera or high-end DSLRs. However, without a general knowledge of photography, these devices are merely a lump of digital burden. Hence, with a sole purpose to help you excel your photography skills, we have collected few photography terms. After the end of this article, you will gain a general knowledge to take good photos and will gain a conscience to buy a new camera device that matches your photography interests.  Megapixels  It determines how big the image will practically be. Megapixel only reckons the maximum size of the image while zooming or printing without getting pixelated. Megapixel determining the quality of photos is just codswallop. Evidently, Samsung Galaxy S7 (12 MP) captures great photos as compared to OnePlus 3 (16 MP).        PC: Photography Life  Sensor size  The size is always written in a fraction with 1 divided by a number, 1/2.3” and 1/2.6” for an instance. Smaller the denominator, greater will be the size of the sensor and vice versa. With a greater sensor, greater will be the size of a pixel and greater pixel size ensures better quality photos.  The aperture  Aperture sizes  This is the hole within the lens, through which light enters the camera body. Evidently, larger the hole, more amount of light enters through the lens into the sensor. The aperture is measured in terms of ‘f-number’, which is a focal ratio. ‘f-number’ is the ratio of the diameter of lens aperture to the length of the lens. Larger the f-number, smaller is the aperture (smaller hole). It is written as f divided by a certain number, for example, f/1.8. Smaller the denominator, larger will be the hole and vice versa.  Images with varying aperture  Aperture not only controls the amount of light in the sensor but also controls the ‘depth of the field’. In the case of landscape photography, greater depth of field is required, so larger f-number is required. Larger f-number (smaller aperture) ensures more of the picture in focus. However, for the subjective focus like ‘bokeh effect’, smaller f-number ensures perfection. Smaller f-number provides shallow depth of field keeping less of the picture in focus.  ISO  It is the measure of how much sensitive the camera is to light. The sensitivity of the camera increases with the increase in ISO value. A higher value of ISO is set to capture images in the dark and low values in the daylight.  Images with varying ISO  It is good to have a camera device that has the capability to capture images with higher ISOs. However, capturing the images with higher ISO will induce noise/grain in the photos. They are unnoticeable while printing in small sizes. However, on printing in large size or on zooming, the grain will be conspicuous.  Shutter speed  The shutter in the camera is like a curtain, which opens for a while and closes. For the time of shutter being open, the sensor of the camera is exposed to the scene it sees through the lens and the detail is captured and is saved as a photo. The time of shutter being open is called shutter speed and is normally expressed in fraction of a second.  photos with varying shutter speed  Shutter speed in a camera is used to control the movement of a subject in a photograph. While shooting a photo, if the subjects in focus are in motion then the captured images would be blurry. In the photography, this is referred as ‘camera shake’. So, for capturing motion subjects, you should set a faster shutter speed. For an instance, if you wish to shoot a race of Formula 1, then you should keep a fast shutter speed of around 1/2000. However, for the stationary subjects like mountains or any natural scenario, even a low shutter speed of 1/4 would suffice.  Image stabilization (IS)  It happens most of the time that our handshakes while pressing the capture button. This results in a blurry image, making us disappointed. IS on your phone ignores gentle shakes while taking the photos and gives a clear image despite shakes. There are two types of image stabilization technique, optical image stabilization (OIS) and electronic image stabilization (EIS).   In this technique, the image stabilization is done by varying the optical path of the sensor. This is real time compensation and hence no alteration or image degradation takes place. With the gentle shake of the device, the OIS mechanism makes the lens rotate in opposite direction. Due to which, the lens assembly always remains parallel to the image plane. And at the end, a clear and sharp image is obtained. In addition, OIS guarantees a better quality image even in the low light. However, EIS works on a completely different principle and in this technique the problem is solved at programming level after the optical signal has been converted to a digital signal. If your phone is equipped with Image Stabilization, you are in benefit.  Focus  After all the photography, all we need is a sharp subject. Focusing is the technique of giving extra attention to the subject, ensuring the sharpness in the designated subject. However, there are different types of focusing techniques installed in camera devices. Some of them are discussed here.   LASER Autofocus: – The device supporting LASER autofocus inherits a LASER sensor, which is used to adjust the focus of the subject pointed. Near the device camera, there lies a LASER transmitter, which fires out LASER light burst towards the subject selected. After the strike of LASER beam, they are reflected. With the time taken to travel towards the subject and to return, the actual distance of the subject is calculated. That is how the subject is focused. Laser Autofocus  Phase detection Autofocus (PDAF):- In the PDAF, the sensor detects the phase of the light coming from the subject and tries to keep the light in phase with its movement. At the end, the subject is locked within the focus area.     Dual- Pixel Autofocus (DPAF):- In DPAF method, the principle involved is same as that of PDAF. In the cameras with PDAF, only 5-10% of the sensor pixels are phase detection enabled. However, on the DPAF enabled cameras, all the sensor pixels are phase detection enabled, so a lightning fast focusing can be obtained. Similarly, on the DPAF enabled cameras, two separate light-sensitive photodiodes are provided for each pixel. These photodiodes convert light energy into electrical signals. During AF detection, two such signals are analyzed for focus information, which merges intro one when the images are captured. Hence, a sharp image is obtained.  Contrast Detection Autofocus (CDAF):- Contrast Detection Autofocus is another method of automatic focusing. The basic principle behind the CDAF is that the system involved analyses the contrast of the image sensor for different focal positions and thereby focuses on the point at which there is maximum contrast. When the point of maximum contrast is found, the optical system is adjusted accordingly. Hence, a sharper image is captured. CDAF offers a greater accuracy over PDAF, however, the speed is quite slow.  Hybrid Autofocus (HAF):- In the HAF, multiple autofocusing techniques are employed to offer greater accuracy and speed. This autofocusing technique produces more sharp images as the disadvantage on one autofocus technique is fixed with the addition of other. Generally, the combination of CDAF and PDAF are used on HAF.   Flash  With the sole intention to let you capture quality images even in a poor –lighting-condition, the flash was included in the camera. And out there in the market, there are multitudes of devices carrying a different type of flashing technology. Some of them are discussed here.    Single LED flash:- In the devices with single LED flash, the single LED embedded to it flashes, whenever the shots are taken.  Dual LED flash:- In the devices with dual LED flash, both the LEDs embedded to it flashes, whenever the shots are taken. The shots taken by these devices are brighter than that of devices with single LED flash.  Dual tone flash:- In the devices supporting dual tone flash, there are two LEDs, both having a different shade/color. One of LED will be a cool type or bluish and another will be a warm type or yellowish. According to the subject, the intensity of both the lights is varied. The lights produced by both the LEDs are mixed ensuring a more natural image.   With the knowledge of above terms and making a proper exposure, you surely can take great photos. So, grab your device out and expose your photography skills.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/understanding-smartphone-camera-terms-beginners-guide-to-photography-.jpg']

The company will unveil its latest midrange phone on October 11 as the latest teaser suggests. The Honor 6x was one of the most successful midrange phones and Huawei wants to continue that trend with the upcoming release.  Huawei Honor 7X Rumored Specs:  As per the leaked info, the Honor 7x is going to feature the infinity display with an aspect ratio of 18:9. With bezel-less like the design, the phone is going to be a little bit bigger at 6-inches. It is going to be powered by the Huawei’s in-house Kirin 659 chipset which is an upgrade from Kirin 650 used on the Honor 6x. The Kirin 659 SoC has an octa-core processor (4x A53 at 2.36GHz + 4x A53 at 1.7GHz) with MaliT830-MP2. It is equivalent to Snapdragon 625 ( Xiaomi MiA1 ) and Exynos 7870 ( Samsung J7 Pro ) in terms of performance.  Huawei is lately known for its incredible dual cameras on its high-end phones like Mate 9 and P10 Plus.

We all know that light is made up of electromagnetic particles that travel in waves. These waves emit energy and range in length and strength. The interrelation between wavelength and energy can be described as – shorter the wavelength; higher the energy. Light can be grouped according to wavelength into an electromagnetic spectrum that consists of gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet (UV) rays, visible light, infrared light, and radio waves.     However, the human eye is sensitive to only one part of this spectrum: visible light, which is seen as colours: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.\xa0 Blue light has a very short wavelength, and thus it produces a higher amount of energy.  The sources of blue light include- the Sun, and it’s artificial sources include electronic devices such as cell phones and laptop computers, as well as energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs and LED lights.        In this present tech-savvy world, it would be irrelevant to say that our exposure to blue light has not been increasing.\xa0Most of us spend the majority of our waking hours staring at the digital screen, whether it’s the computer at work, our personal cell phone, playing a video game, or just relaxing and watching TV. However, it is essential to understand what this exposure is doing to us.  Blue light has both pros and cons. In its natural form, your body uses blue light from the sun to regulate your natural sleep and wake cycles.\xa0 This is known as your circadian rhythm. It also helps boost alertness, heighten reaction times, elevate moods, and increase the feeling of well-being. However, prolonged exposure to artificial blue light or blue light after sundown may cause retinal damage and contribute to age-related macular degeneration, which can lead to loss of vision;\xa0several types of cancer (breast, prostate), diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Similarly, brain imaging researchers have found brain changes to be very similar in those addicted to their smartphones and other digital devices as those who are addicted to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, meth and other drugs.\xa0Many studies have also shown that screen use increases depression, anxiety, and aggression, and can even lead to psychotic-like behaviour and a loss of touch with reality.   Effects of exposure to blue light after sundown   Affects\xa0your natural circadian rhythm  Triggers memory problems and trouble learning, anxiety  Disrupts hormones: raises insulin and cortisol, suppresses melatonin, lowers leptin and testosterone, destroys dopamine,  a neurotransmitter that helps regulate movement and emotional responses.\xa0  Developmental process in children is greatly affected: social interaction, creativity, compassion, engagement and communication skills  Causes eye strain, dry eyes, blurry vision, damages the retina and increases risk of macular degeneration  Reduces muscle strength  Increases risk of diabetes, depression, obesity, heart disease, gastrointestinal problems, breast and prostate cancer, and other diseases   Ways to be safe from Blue light   Avoid looking at bright screens two to three hours before bed  If you work a night shift or use a lot of electronic devices at night, consider wearing blue-blocking glasses (orange tinted glasses) or installing apps like – the  F.lux ,  Twilight app  or any other blue light filter app onto your wireless devices  Expose yourself to lots of bright light during the day, which will boost your ability to sleep at night, as well as your mood and alertness during daylight  Dim the lights in your home when the sun goes down so your body can produce melatonin naturally. Turn on salt lamps or light some candles  Implement digital detox   It is better to be safe than sorry! Rather than risking oneself to all those health hazards, it is highly smart that we implement these ideas to keep ourselves safe and healthy.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Blue-light-from-smartphone-displays-How-to-be-safe-bluelight-filters-.jpg']

['Samsung Galaxy J7 Max Review: The New Goto Midrange Smartphone?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['September 27, 2017']",2017-09-27 14:28:47+00:00,"['Samsung is among the raining smartphones in the Nepali market, and everybody well knows about it. Among the variety of j7 lineups, the all-new  Samsung Galaxy J7 Max  is, without a doubt one of the new launches that people are talking about. The’ Max’ in its name gives a clear idea that the phone has something large in it, which unquestionably is the size.  Labeled with a price of  Rs. 28,290 , this smartphone, other than its massive 5.7- inch display enjoys a 4 GB RAM that is quite an impression in a Samsung phone under the price bracket of Rs. 30,000.  Latest Price: Rs. 26,290 [Last updated on: December 6, 2018]         Handset Highlights:   Dimension: 156.7 x 78.8 x 8.1 mm  Weight: 179g  5.7-inch Full HD PLS Display  Android v7.0 Nougat  4 GB RAM; 32 GB ROM; Dedicated SDcard slot for memory expansion up to\xa0256 GB  Octa-Core MediaTek MT6757 Helio P20 Processor  13 MP Rear Camera with f/1.7 aperture, LED Flash  13 MP Front Facing Camera with f/1.9 aperture and LED Flash  Dual SIM (Nano + Nano)  4G connectivity, WiFi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, A-GPS, USB OTG  Front-mounted Fingerprint Sensor  Gyro sensor  3300 mAh Battery  Color(s) available: Gold, Black  Samsung Galaxy J7 Max Price in Nepal: Rs. 28,290   Display and design  First things first, what’s striking about this phone is the massive 5.7-inch display that makes it look like a phone cum phablet. It sports a PLS display and not the usual celebrated Samsung AMOLED display panel, which can be a bit of a setback to most. However, that does not stop it from providing a crisp and vivid display as J7 Max is equipped with an FHD screen.   I have thoroughly enjoyed watching movies in it, all thanks to its display. The display is bright enough and has good viewing angles. Only under extreme sunlight, the visibility gets a little tough.   Needless to say, the phone does not fit in my pocket. Ladies’ jeans have small pockets of themselves. So, I asked one of my friends to put it in his pocket and again it resulted in the edges of the phone popping out slightly.   The Galaxy J7 Max sports a metallic build, except for the top and bottom portion on the rear side. The bezels on this device are less and on hands; it is not too slippery which append up to the positives. Nevertheless, the phone looks like any other conventional Samsung smartphones, so overall, there is nothing ‘wow’ in it in terms of appearance.   Battery   The J7 MAX is powered by a 3,300mAh battery which is one of the driving forces behind the phone’s performance. Though I don’t play heavy games, I am into activities like streaming videos and listening to music most of my time. Once fully charged, this device gave me an entire day of continuous usage, noting the fact that the battery was not fully dead for 3 hours of normal usage the next day. To make things better, the presence of various power saving modes helps you optimize your battery life. The phone, however, does not support fast charging, so be prepared to put this phone on charge for about 2 and a half hours to get it full on power.  Camera  To all the mobile photographers out there, this phone brings good news. The device flaunts a 13 MP f/1.7 primary camera and a 13 MP f/1.9 selfie camera. What’s even better is, both the cameras are equipped with led flash, so no more shady selfies and dark images in low light! However, on my usage of the camera, even the slightest of movements resulted in shaky images (same goes with the videos), so make sure you have a firm hand while clicking pictures and shooting videos. Also, there’s a noticeable lag while taking pictures. Both the front & back can capture video in 1080p@30fps and there is no video stabilization. Overall, in this budget range, the phone’s camera does more than justice to the price.     Performance  Samsung Galaxy J7 Max runs on Android 7.0 (Nougat) operating system with Experience UI and is powered by 1.69GHz octa-core MT Helio P20 processor.\xa0 The absence of Samsung’s renowned Exynos processor is a little disappointing here. \xa0It has a vertical swiping interface in place of a separate apps button, so by swiping up or down, you can navigate to your desired apps spontaneously.   The phone offers 4GB of RAM in total and an expandable 32 GB of internal storage. App switching is an ease in this device. I tried running multiple apps at once to check for any difficulties in app switching but amazingly there was none. The fingerprint sensor in this phone resides on the home button and is swift and responds well to touch. The maximum number of fingerprints you can add is three. On the J7 Max’s use, I have not encountered any lags in the performance side, although, at one instance, it froze when I tried opening a game. But that was only once, and it never happened again! For heavy gamers old there, it’s not an ideal phone since the\xa0Mali-T880MP2 suffers a lot and there’s noticeable heat while gaming for more than 15 minutes.  An important spec I found majorly missing in it was NFC. NFC is a cool feature and including it, the phone could have been better.   The J7 MAX attributes a smart glow feature where a LED ring around the rear camera glows for notifications. You can customize this feature for particular app or contact in four different customizable colors in accordance to your choice. However, for people who don’t keep their phones upside down, this feature may not appeal much, but for those who do, this can be fun and useful.  In terms of connectivity, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Max supports 4G network. The phone exhibits a dual SIM card slot on the right side and also a slot for micro SD card. Well, with this you don’t have to sacrifice one of your SIM card slots to a memory card slot.  Even on continuous use, J7 MAX does not heat much, so that portion is commendable. I am not saying it does not heat at all but having used other phones, this one showed quite a performance in this area. But you really got to watch for the absence of gorilla glass protection.  Conclusion  On my say about this phone, I would state that for this price, the phone is a decent pick. It has an excellent battery life and display. If I weren’t to go for the looks, the mediocre processor, and absence of fast charging, the phone is not a bad deal. Nonetheless, in the similar price bracket, other phones may give this one a fight. On the plus side, the camera performs really well and the 4 GB RAM is something to look after.      Pros  Cons    Good battery life  No Gorilla Glass Protection    Good cameras  Lack of AMOLED display    Smart Glow feature  No fast charging    Good for day to day use  Average Gaming Performance']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/4T3A9894.jpg']

['What is SAR value in Smartphone and Why Should You Care?'],['Guides'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['September 27, 2017']",2017-09-27 08:30:41+00:00,"['SAR stands for  Specific Absorption Rate.  It is the measure of the rate at which energy (in Watts) is absorbed by the human body when exposed to\xa0radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field, per unit kg of the human body weight. It can also be referred to as the absorption of other forms of energy by tissue, including ultrasound. In the case of smartphones, the SAR is measured by keeping the phone in the talking position and then calculating the amount of radiation absorbed by the part of your head which is closest to the antennas of the smartphone.  Primarily, while buying a smartphone, users are usually concerned about the camera, display, processor or battery but it is also equally essential to keep note of the SAR value of the smartphone before considering it as an option. The Federation Communications Commission (FCC) and EU have stringent safety standards regarding cellphone radiation levels. And according to it, \xa0every country has a regulatory threshold value of SAR. In the US, the regulatory unit is 1.6W/kg; in Europe, it is 2W/kg and in India, it is\xa01.6 W/kg. The SAR rating of each individual phone model has been displayed on all mobile phone packaging done in both the US and the UK. This makes the users make informed choices while purchasing a smartphone. Generally, the SAR values of smartphones are mentioned at the bottom of the packaging.  Several types of research conducted over the effects of smartphone use and their potential health hazards have concluded that\xa0the exposure to RF radiation, even at levels below national guidelines, are not completely without potential health risks. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US has announced- “The cellular industry should design mobile phones in a way that minimizes any RF exposure to the user that is not necessary for the device to function.” This indeed is an essential precautionary step towards reducing the potential health hazards. Not only on human beings, these radiations also effect wildlife and vegetation. Unlike smoke, these radiations are not visible to the naked eye and long time exposures to them have been linked to prolonged complications.        However, it is necessary that the users understand that the SAR values mentioned, have been calculated when the phone is in its finest condition. And this value may vary as per the usage of the device. The older a device gets its SAR value keeps on surging. We can say that the SAR Value largely depends upon the circumstances under which the smartphone is being used and how frequently it is being used. It is imperative that the users keep in mind that a smartphone with a lower SAR Value can emit more radiations than a smartphone with higher SAR value if the smartphone with higher SAR is being used under normal conditions and the one with lower SAR is being under poor signal strength areas.  Precaution is obligatory in order to prevent the possible health hazards due to RF. The following steps have been suggested by researchers to minimize the effects –   Try to use headsets all the time, avoid putting your phone in your ears. This is the best way to stay away from radiations of your smartphones.  Try to use texts more instead of calling every now and then, Call only when it is really important. Tests are usually short and to the point, so it saves lots of your time too.  Switch off your phone when you go to bed or put your phone on the airplane mode and then turn ON the WiFi if you want anyone to reach out to you via the internet (incase it’s a matter of emergency).  You can use various cases available out in the market which claims to shield this radiation, but we are not sure whether those cases are reliable or not.  Avoid using your phone in those areas where the signal strength is poor because while searching for the network your antennas keep on producing the radiations to their maximum limit.  Lastly, after following all these measures if you still feel threatened due to some symptoms mentioned above, then you should go ahead and replace your smartphone.   Irrespective of the low SAR value of your smartphone mentioned in the manufacturing box, it is highly advised that you follow the aforementioned steps to keep yourself safe from the potential hazards.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SAR-value-in-smartphone.jpg']

Whenever you are on-the-go and outside the reach of wi-fi, using data has become a go-to solution. However, data connectivity is not top-notch in everyone’s phone.   To test how data connectivity works on smartphones in the Philippines, BASS PH ( Bandwidth and Signal Strength) mobile app has been  specifically monitoring the strength of the cellular signal and the speed of the mobile internet in the Philippines by collecting test results made by users. The BASS PH app was  designed by volunteers for volunteers in order to accumulate data related to signal strengths and location-based bandwidth to improve the state of local internet quality in the Philippines.  According to data gathered by the BASS app, Huawei smartphones registered the fastest mobile internet speeds among all devices running the BASS app.        The chart published by the app clearly shows the device MHA-AL000 (Huawei Mate9) at the highest scale in terms of the highest average speed among all devices used in measuring mobile internet in the Philippines. The chart features phones from Asus, Apple, Sony, Jiayu, Oppo, One Plus and Samsung among others on lower co-ordinates in the graph. Other Huawei devices like the P10, P10 Plus and the Nexus 6P also showed strong results.  The Chinese multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is a leading global ICT solutions provider that has been innovating customer-centric technologies and ideas. The fact that the company has been establishing end-to-end capabilities and strengths to raise benchmarks in terms of ICT solutions and services. And, in the Philippines, Huawei has a good foothold as they  run almost 100% of Globe’s network and around 50% of Smart’s network. As Huawei has set up cellular radio towers with the support of their expertise in engineering, it has helped them maximize the mobile internet speed.  The chart released by the BASS app might let the customers make a good pick if they are looking for the best option in terms of mobile internet. And as the performance and other features of the smartphones from Huawei are satisfactory, this speed test might actually be a boon for the market outreach of the company.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Huawei-phones-best-internet-speed.jpg']

['Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro Review: The Flagship Midrange?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['September 24, 2017']",2017-09-24 15:47:14+00:00,"['The distinction between a mid-range and few flagships is marginal these days. Most of the mid-range phones are getting the flagship treatment with unibody metal construct, great display, and other well-curated features. Today we have the Galaxy J7 Pro which by its looks and feel, is no less than a flagship. In this review, we’ll see how the J7 Pro stacks up against a flagship as a midrange device.  Specifications of Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro   5.5-inch full HD (1080p) Super AMOLED 2.5D curved glass\xa0display with 401ppi  Exynos 7870 System on a chip  1.6 GHz Octa-core CPU (14nm, Cortex A53)  3GB RAM, 64GB Internal memory, expandable memory up to 128GB with micro SD  Android 7.0 (Nougat) with\xa0Samsung’s custom UI on top  Dual SIM  Water-resistant  13MP rear camera with LED flash,\xa0f/1.9 aperture, and 1080p video recording capability  13MP front-facing camera with LED flash, f/1.9 aperture.  Augmented Reality (AR), Social Camera, Samsung Pay  Metal unibody  4G Cat 6 connectivity, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS  3600mAh battery  Color variants: Black and Gold  Latest Price: Rs. 25,900 [Last updated on: December 6, 2018]   Build and Design:  Samsung has left no room to spare when it comes to build and design of the phone. J7 Pro comes with a metal clad unibody which has a minimalist approach. The back of the phone is kept clean with unique antenna lines which gives an alienating vibe to the phone.         With a curved body and metal finish, it sure is slippery on the hand but the feel is nothing short from a flagship. The curved rounded edges also contribute to better handling of the device.   Display:  The attempt to carry the flagship specs continues with its 5.5inch full HD super AMOLED display. For me, the best thing about the phone is the display itself. The display stretches from side to side almost making it bezel-less which also contributes to its handy form factor. As an AMOLED display, there are deep blacks and the icons look as if they’re floating when you apply a dark wallpaper. In addition to that, utilizing the AMOLED panel is the always on display which I wish every phone had. It is so much easier to check the time and basic notifications without unlocking the device.   In general, the screen is bright and vibrant, contents are presented with high details and sharpness. Viewing angles from almost anywhere is good and the sunlight visibility is on point. Watching movies and playing games is a joy on this display. For a mid-range phone, the display experience of the J7 Pro is exceptional.  Hardware:  Continuing the trend of awkward speaker placement, the J7 Pro comes with a loudspeaker on the right side along with the power button. The volume rocker rests on the left side. This side also comprises of Hybrid SIM tray (SIM 2+Micro SD card) and a single SIM tray (SIM 1). Samsung still hasn’t opted for USB Type C port, the J7 Pro comes with micro USB 2.0 port for charging and data syncing.   Talking about sensors, the phone comes with fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, and compass. Up front, the phone holds a fingerprint sensor which acts as a home button. It is really fast to set up and unlocks the device in no time. With a sharp display and gyro sensor, you can use the device for VR experience.   Software/UI:  Galaxy J7 Pro is running on Android 7.1 with Experience UI 8.0 on top. Unlike in the past, Samsung’s UI has evolved and now takes a more functional and minimal approach. I like how swift and smooth the UI is. ON the surface, it might look pretty basic but once you dig deep enough, there are a plethora of functionalities. To start with, we have the standard double tap on the home button to launch the camera app, which I found myself using the most. For someone who spends a lot of time looking at a display, the inbuilt blue light filter is a bliss. And if you are an audiophile, the inbuilt equalizer does justice to your ears. For privacy, you can lock and mask apps and along with that, there’s secure folder, where all your private photos, videos, and other information gets securely locked. For customization, there’s theme store for a variety of themes, icon packs, and wallpaper. You’ve also got device maintenance, which shows a complete overview of how the device is functioning. It provides options to optimize phone by cleaning cache, freeing up storage and lets you choose power saving modes.

And Samsung still walks on the trail of default apps conflict, you’ve got two apps for email, cloud storage, browser and so on. But fortunately, the ones you don’t need can be disabled.  Performance:   Galaxy J7 Pro hasn’t upgraded much in terms of performance power. Powering the device is the 14nm based Exynos 7870 octa-core chipset clocked at 1.6Ghz which we saw on last year’s J7 Prime. As most of the devices at similar price range still haven’t boarded the 14nm wagon, the last year’s chipset still has an upper hand this year. The performance is similar to that of the J7 Prime. General navigation around the UI, the opening of apps, scrolling and everything is effortless.  When it comes to gaming, the processor can handle high-end games at medium settings and there is little to no frame drops while gaming for hours. Sporting a metal body, the device obviously heats to some extent, but it is bearable and won’t bother you much. The J7 Pro comes with 3GB of RAM and is good enough to cycle between few apps with ease. The performance overall is not that bad, but I wished for a more upgraded and powerful chipset that could go head to head with Snapdragon 625 chipset.  Also Read:  Samsung Phones Price in Nepal  Camera:  Samsung phones mark the standard when it comes to mobile cameras and it is true even for the mid-range series. \xa0The Galaxy J7 Pro comes with the 13MP camera both on the front and the back.   Let’s talk about the primary camera first. It comes with a larger f/1.7 aperture which takes in more light into its sensors capturing images with higher details. Photos come out sharp and colors are finely saturated which is typical of Samsung. The dynamic range is adequately met. The camera is snappy and offers a manual mode for exposure, white balance, and ISO control.   On extreme low light conditions, the image quality suffers a lot but with enough light, the camera can do wonders with its wider aperture. \xa0The full HD video recording at 30fps is also good. Videos maintain the sharpness and colors like in the photos and there are no constant exposure shifts.   Now coming onto the front camera, the selfie flash remains in the J7 series. Images from selfie camera are well lit, colors are close to natural and the details are fine. This camera will be a good companion for those who adore taking selfie except for in the low light conditions as its front-facing flash doesn’t contribute well in those situations.   Overall, the camera experience on this phone is really amazing.  Connectivity and Storage:  J7 Pro is a dual SIM phone and comes with a dedicated microSD card slot. Phone calls and internet connectivity is great on the device. It supports dual-band ac Wi-Fi so the stability and performance of wireless networks are fast and reliable. J7 also makes use of the NFC with Samsung Pay which to our disadvantage cannot be utilized.  For storage, the phone comes with 64GB memory which I managed to utilize up to 21 GB till the time of this review and there’s still much more room left. If it’s inadequate you can slide in a microSD card up to 256GB.  Battery:  J7 Pro comes with a 3600mAh battery which gives around 6 hours of screen on time. For my day to day usage, the battery would last easily for a day and sometimes even till midday the day after. With different power saving modes, the battery life can be further elongated. J7 Pro, on the contrary, doesn’t offer any fast charging, so you have to stick your charger up to 2 and a half hours to fully get it charged.  Conclusion:  Galaxy J7 Pro is one of the few phones in the market which holds the premium standard as a midrange device. The device looks and feels up class and has left no room to spare when it comes to its build.  What do I like about the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro?   The Super AMOLED display makes the consuming contents more enjoyable.  The camera obviously is a great joy to play around with, which delivers awesome quality.   What I disliked about the Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro?   The 14nm chipset delivers good performance and ensures great battery life but other phones at similar price range have better performance.  It takes 2 and a half hour to fully charge the device.

Pair that with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, that’s a configuration most high-end flagships hold.

The phone will be known as Huawei Mate 10 Lite outside of Asian market. We also recently saw the launch of  vivo X20 and x20+  in China which featured the similar 18:9 display. The Maimang 6 is a mid-range phone which also has 4 cameras as its feature focus.  It is equipped with 5.9 inches full HD display with 2.5D glass offering a seamless look. As conventional, the side bezels are really minimal making it easier for proper grip. The protection used on the display is not mentioned.

We assume the back offers bokeh effect while the front comprises of wide angle lens.  On the downside, it is running on Android 7.0 Nougat with EMUI 5.1 on top. Huawei phones usually don’t get updates. The phone is stuck with what it comes out with. Backing up the phone is a decent 3,340mAh battery.

['Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt Review: Old but Gold'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['September 22, 2017']",2017-09-22 10:42:39+00:00,"['Rebranding the  Galaxy J7 (2015) ,  Samsung  has come up with a budget smartphone —  Galaxy J7 Nxt . Priced at Rs. 20,000, the smartphone is the least expensive one from Samsung to run on Android 7.0 Nougat. After using the smartphone for over a week, I have had a chance to explore most of its marketed specifications and features. Now, I would like to walk you through the highs and lows.  Key Specification of Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt:\xa0   Dimensions:\xa0152.4 x 78.6 x 7.6 mm (6.00 x 3.09 x 0.30 in)  5.5 inch Super AMOLED Display (720 x 1280 pixels ~267ppi pixel density)  Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box  Octa-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53 processor,\xa0Exynos 7870 chipset with\xa0Mali-T830 MP1 GPU  3GB RAM, 32GB Internal Storage:\xa0Expandable up to 256GB via MicroSD card  Rear Camera:\xa013 MP, f/1.9, 28mm, autofocus, LED flash  Front Camera:\xa05 MP, f/2.2, 23mm, LED flash  3.5mm audio jack  Connectivity: Dual-SIM (nano+nano), G LTE, microUSB, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, FM Radio\xa0and\xa0A-GPS, GLONASS.  Sensors: Accelerometer, Proximity  Plastic build, removable back  3000 mAh removable battery  Latest Price: Rs. 18,990 [Last updated on: December 6, 2018]   Build and Design  The first thing that I noticed as soon as I took hold of the J7 Nxt is the feel of the patterned back which also made it a lot easier to prevent the phone from slipping out of hands. Alos, the device did not heat up much on use which was a given plus-point.         The placement of the buttons on the phone is an ultimate wow. The phone falls on the lighter scale side and hence is really efficient. Though it does not have much to offer with respect to the previous J7, there is not really much to complain.   Display  The J7 Nxt comes with a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display.\xa0As compared with other budget phones, the incredible details and true colors that this phone offers is really commendable.   The Super AMOLED display (720 x 1280 pixels) with 267 PPI Pixel density display was never a let down for me. However, as the phone lacks an ambient light sensor, there is no auto-brightness feature in the phone which was a turndown. I had to make sure I turned on the “Outdoor Mode” on before heading out somewhere.  Hardware  The phone features volume button on the left and the power button on the right with the home button at the bottom. The phone features a 3.5mm slot for a headphone jack at the bottom. For charging, the device has micro USB 2.0 port at the bottom and features a speaker at the back side which did not really perform as well as I had expected it to.   One let down in terms of the hardware of the phone is that it lacked a fingerprint sensor! The whole time that I spent with the phone, the lack of the sensor was felt almost every time I had to unlock the phone.  Software  On the software side, the J7 Nxt features the Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. I really loved the UI and the design that the phone offered. While being minimalist, the design and the UI both were equally amazing and attractive.   Performance  The smartphone is powered by an octa-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53 processor and comes with an Exynos 7870 chipset and a Mali-T830 MP1 GPU.  To see how the phone actually performed, I had tried running multiple heavy games and apps simultaneously.\xa0During the earlier days, however, certain apps crashed often and raised disappointment by displaying the message: “The app has stopped working.”. But with time, these messages were minimized. All in all, though, it was a really nice experience to play games and watch videos with amazing vibrancy and smoothness.  Camera  To speak of the 13MP rear and the 5MP front cameras, the pictures taken came out decent enough. However, most of them felt pretty washed out losing the actual essence of the scenario. I personally took a lot of pictures on various settings with the 13MP rear camera\xa0at various settings such as a birthday party, a rainy afternoon, a late night street view among others. For most of these occasions, I used the “double press the home button to open the camera” feature to take the pictures and hence I found that feature really useful.   Moreover, most of the pictures I took were during the afternoon and the evening hours and all of the pictures had utmost vibrancy, making the experience more memorable.       Connectivity  The Galaxy J7 Nxt comes with Dual-SIM (nano+nano), G LTE, microUSB, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, FM Radio\xa0and\xa0A-GPS, GLONASS. During the ten days that I used the phone, I had to travel to a lot of places within the city. For this, I had utilized the A-GPS feature which helped me reach places on time and hence I personally really liked this feature of the phone.  Battery  The major plus point about the phone is its 3000mAh battery which did not only perform fully to its power but also charged pretty quick. As I continuously used the phone throughout the day, I also carried my charger with me. But, thankfully, I did not have to use it as much because the battery did not run out of juice as quickly as I thought it would.   Also, even though the phone has no quick charge functionality, the lack was not felt at all. The battery charged pretty quickly on its own and also provided a really good backup under regular usage.  Verdict  Finally, to speak of what I felt about the Galaxy J7 Nxt, I must say that I had a really good experience with the phone. It did not let me get lost in the alleys and corners of Kathmandu and also helped me capture moments with its quick functioning camera. Carrying the light phone and going to places while testing the new fonts and having a good time playing multiple games on the phone will always be my favorite experiences.   The phone is an example in terms of budget smartphones within Rs.20,000. And a possible heart-winner Samsung budget phone. If you are low on budget and are looking forward to get yourself or gift someone else a Samsung smartphone, that provides good battery backup and camera performance, your search might end here!  Pros: What I liked\xa0about the J7 Nxt?   The Super AMOLED display (720 x 1280 pixels)  The 14nm processor.  The remarkable 3000mAh battery.  The low-light camera performance.  The split-window feature.   Cons: What could have been better in the J7 Nxt?   No fingerprint sensor, gyro-sensor, and auto-brightness feature.  The outdated design and plastic body.  The speaker']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nxt-j7.jpg']

The Plus model obligatorily carries a bigger display and larger battery capacity. Aside from that, most of the internal specifications are practically the same.  To start with, both phone embraces Super AMOLED display with 18:9 aspect ratio which is the new standard for smartphone displays. With this aspect ratio, the display is elongated top to bottom and the sides are relatively smaller, making the device easier to grip on hand. Vivo x20 shoulders a 6.01-inch display while the bigger Vivo x20 Plus has a 6.43-inch display sharing the common 1080*2160 resolution. With Super AMOLED display, you will be getting high contrast, better sharpness and deeper blacks for an exceptional viewing experience. However, no protection is mentioned for the display.         Under the hood, vivo x20 and x20 Plus are powered by Snapdragon 660 chipset with Octa-core 2.2GHz CPU. The Snapdragon 660 is based on 14nm process technology making the phone both power efficient and enables faster processing. Both phones come with 4GB of RAM for multitasking. It offers 64GB onboard storage which can be further expanded up to 256GB using the micro SD card.  Vivo x20’s are running on FunTouch OS 3.0 based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The phone offers few notable features like Face Wake, which like Face ID on new  iPhone X , uses face to unlock the device. It identifies up to 128 different facial details before unlocking the device within 0.1sec as claimed by the company. It also offers its own AI assistant which detects your usage patterns and devotes more processing power to those tasks. Vivo has also incorporated a similar feature to Game Mode offered by Samsung called Vivo Game Engine. It enhances gameplay for high-end titles and blocks incoming notifications and calls that hinder your gaming. The phones even offer Hi-Fi audio for a quality audio experience.   On the camera department, x20’s offer dual camera in a pair of 12MP and 5MP shooters. The 12MP camera comes with f/1.8 aperture. Optical Image Stabilization, however, is offered only on the x20 Plus. The dual Camera helps the phone to calculate depth and add bokeh to the photos. It can shoot full HD videos at 30fps. For selfies, it offers 12MP dual pixel camera with f/2.0 aperture.  On connectivity side of things, vivo x20’s offer dual-SIM support, Bluetooth 5.0, Dual Band ac Wi-Fi, and out of all the great things, micro USB port instead of USB C. The port does support OTG however. Vivo X20 is backed by 3,250mAh battery and the X20 Plus by 3,900mAh battery.

Google will get a non-exclusive license for HTC’s intellectual property meaning all the design and manufacturing patents of HTC will belong to Google as well.  With this deal, around 2000 researchers and engineers who have been working on Pixel lineup will be joining Google. That’s almost half the workforce of HTC’s smartphone division. This agreement seems to be beneficial for both the parties. HTC needs Google’s money to keep its boat floating and Google needs HTC to take its hardware forward.  HTC is currently in financial crisis as it’s failing in smartphone space against giants with deep pockets like Samsung. HTC’s market share has dropped from 8.8% in 2011 to 0.9 percent today. Google on the other hand for years has been dependent upon other manufacturers to build their smartphone lineup(Nexus). Google and HTC have a pretty long history.

They are also working on the  2 nd  iteration of Pixel devices which will be unveiled on October 4 th .        Source: TechCrunch  Google’s intention on striking this deal is straightforward. They want to create their own smartphone that can compete with\x1b Apple both in terms of build and software consistency through updates. Google also bought Motorola in the past but once they realized it couldn’t compete with Apple with the resources at hand it sold the company to Lenovo.

We may see a lot of Google manufactured smartphone in 2018!  HTC will also continue to manufacture their smartphones. But most importantly it will be investing more on the HTC VIVE virtual reality headset which is gaining a lot of popularity and could be “the VR headset” in the future.  “This agreement is a brilliant next step in our longstanding partnership, enabling Google to supercharge their hardware business while ensuring continued innovation within our HTC smartphone and VIVE virtual reality businesses,” HTC CEO Cher Wang']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Google-HTC-Billion-Dollar-Deal.jpg']

Another major ISP in Nepal, NTC has also joined the IPTV market with their own WOW Time app.  Synopsis of Wow Time App:   Only for NTC GSM and CDMA users  Available both on   iOS  and  Android  Free for the first month (until Dashain)  Live TV Data Packs (after Dashain)   All you need to do is download the WOW time app, fire it up, insert your NTC phone number and enter the validation code you get through SMS.

Google Chrome is certainly one of the most used\xa0browsers on a computer. \xa0Here we have compiled a list of some of the best chrome add-ons which are going to supercharge your browsing experience. Prev Next 1 Grammarly\xa0         If you are someone who spends a lot of time typing emails and documents online then you certainly don’t want any grammatical mistakes on those. Grammarly is a grammar check tool for the contents you type online. It makes sure that everything you write on the web is clear, effective and mistake-free.

You don’t always get to read the whole article every time you see them. Pocket helps you to accumulate all of them in a database and access them whenever you have time to read it. Pocket also has a companion mobile app where you can save articles offline and access them whenever or wherever you want. \xa0Pages you save with browser extension will also be synced in the  mobile app  which is a great feature. 3 Iorad – the tutorial builder         Have you ever had to teach someone, especially your parent to follow steps on the web to do a certain thing? Have you not wished there was a way to instructing them with an easier method. Well, this the right tool for the cause!

At the end, iorad gives you a link that you can send to the targeted friend or family that needs help online. 4 Google Input Tool         You may not always be familiar with different language setup for the keyboard. While using the web, we for sure use the English qwerty keyboard and are very much familiar with the keyboard layout. So for every language to learn their respective layout would be a painstaking process. The Google Input Tools extension provides virtual keyboards for over 90 languages, full IMEs or direct transliteration for over 30 different scripts, and handwriting input for over 40 languages. 5 Mercury Reader         If you read a lot of content online then Mercury Reader is a blessing straight out of the Chrome store. Usually, when we read an article online, there are a lot of ads and other distraction that diverts our focus from the main content. Mercury Reader provides clean and consistent view for articles to give you a great reading experience. Once the Mercury Reader is activated, you can change the text size, font and switch theme to either light or dark. 6 Wappalyzer         If you’ve ever wondered what’s powering some of your favorite websites then wappalyzer is a chrome extension to show you just that. \xa0Wappalyzer shows you: Server, the programming language used, Analytics, JS Framework, CDN, Advertising Network and so much more. This tool will certainly come handy for developers. 7 The Great Suspender         If you use Google Chrome then you have probably faced memory management issues. For computers with low-end processors and less RAM, opening too many tabs on chrome is a serious issue. This is where the Great Suspender comes into play to save you some memory. You can assign time period within which if a tab stays idle it’ll be suspended. Like this, you can have hundreds of tabs open without stressing on the memory. You can also whitelist website which you do not want to suspend. You can get the site back to normal, simply by reloading or clicking anywhere on the site. 8 Mail Track.io         If you ever wonder what it would be like if the email had the same sent, received and seen features as that of all common chat messengers, look no further. Mailtrack.io is an email tracking extension for Gmail and Inbox that lets you know if your emails have been read or not. Mailtrack.io extension adds the double check marks in your email. It also shows you how long ago your email was last seen and how many times it was opened. \xa0So people who don’t reply after reading the email, be aware we are watching you! 9 Pushbullet         Pushbullet is a simple tool that creates a bridge between your computer and smartphone. To get the best out of this extension you need to have a companion app on your smartphone or any other device you are using. You can get your smartphone notification and reply to it. With the chrome extension, you can easily push the links of the current websites you’re on to connected devices. You can also directly open links on your browser pushed from different devices as well. It also allows you to add friends on your network to whom you can directly share links and messages. 10 HTTPS Everywhere         HTTPS Everywhere is a security plugin that ensures you’re connecting with a HTTPS connection rather than an HTTP connection if the website supports it. HTTPS connection ensures the protection of your private details with strong encryption. It offers confidentiality and integrity of your identity. So watch out for that extra ‘S’ for security. 11 Privacy Badger         Privacy Badger is a security add-on that disables invisible trackers and spying ads that secretly tracks your movement online to sell your data. A lot of things can be predicted by your browsing activities which can put the user in a vulnerable position. There are a lot of websites that have enabled these invisible trackers and ads which directly affect your online presence. Privacy Badger learns tracking and ads of different sites as you visit them and becomes more powerful in stopping them intelligently. 12 uBlock Origin         Ads are certainly helpful for content creators like us but there are sites that have annoying ads which can contain spying tools. Out of countless ad blockers out there, uBlock origin has the least impact on memory. Ad blockers with usually large host files tend to slow down the browser but this add-on has been optimized to run smoothly without hampering the performance of chrome. But do disable on the sites you love because we content creators cannot survive without ads.

To be precise, it was October 4 when Google unveiled the smartphone. And following that, Google is all set to launch the second version of the Pixel on October 4 again.  How do we know this? Well, there are two answers to that question. The first is a billboard from google with the sentence “Ask more of your phone”. Obviously, that doesn’t specifically say the new Pixel 2 launch event, but that’s the best conclusion one would think of.  If you aren’t\xa0really convinced by the huge billboard, then take a look at the 35 sec youtube video posted by Google. That’s as clear of a hint as we can expect from Google. So, we can safely expect the  Pixel 2 and the XL 2  to be unveiled on the 4th of October.         But what can you expect from them? A full-fledged edge-to-edge\xa0screen, with Android Oreo inside. Likely the Snapdragon 835 inside, with around 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The screen of the Pixel 2 will probably remain at 5″ and the XL 2 with a huge 6 inches. There are even talks of waterproof capabilities for both phones.  Also taking a hint from Google themselves, the new phones will be some really good competitors to the newly announced  iPhone trio  and the  Galaxy Note 8 . The current generation of pixels already offer the best cameras on a smartphone, and we will definitely see an even better camera implementation on the newer generations.  The pixel devices aren’t\xa0officially available in Nepal yet. And don’t expect the newer versions of the devices to be available either.

And the eager note fans will definitely be waiting for this iteration for about two years now. Seeing what happened to the Note 7, and even the Note Fan Edition that didn’t make it to Nepal.  Samsung Nepal has started sending out invites to the tech bloggers and media for the event that is scheduled for this Monday, September 18.  {Update: The Note 8 is available in Nepal  for the price of Rs. 102990 .}         Jumping to the specs the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 features a huge 6.3″ SuperAMOLED display with a resolution of 1440×2960 pixels. That accounts to a sizable 521 pixels per inch. It has a screen to body ratio of 83.2% which makes it one of the best-looking devices out there. It also features the same 18.5:9 aspect ratio as the Galaxy S8 duo. The display is protected by the Gorilla Glass 5 and is HDR 10 compliant.  The phone comes in two flavors, one with the snapdragon and the other with the Exynos SoC variant. Nepali buyers will be enjoying the Exynos variant, although both offer the same level of performance. The internal storage goes up to\xa0a staggering 256GB with 64GB and 128GB as the other two options. Samsung has boosted the RAM to 6GB, and a 3300mAh battery to keep everything running.  The Note 8 also features one of the first dual camera setups from Samsung. Both the sensors support OIS, with one of them capable of 2x optical zoom. The video recording caps out on 4k@30fps. The front houses an 8MP sensor with a f/1.7 aperture lens. Needless to say, the cameras are some of the best in class.   The Note 8 runs on Android\xa07.1.1 Nougat with Android Oreo under development. The phone also flaunts one of the best connectivity options, including the Bluetooth\xa05.0, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 type-c connector and even an option for dual SIM support. And lastly, the phone is waterproof as well.  The phone will be priced\xa0at around Rs 96,000. Looking at the estimated price tag, if you aren’t a hard core Note fan and don’t need the S-pen, you can go for the cheaper S8 plus as well. The S8 plus sports a 0.1 inch smaller screen compared to the Note 8, has 2GB of less RAM and one less camera. So if those features don’t matter much to you, the S8 or the S8 plus might be a better deal for you.  So what do you think of the  Samsung\xa0Galaxy Note 8 ?

Tele Talk Pvt. Ltd., the authorized distributor of Gionee in Nepal, has recently released a budget smartphone:  Gionee X1 , priced at Rs. 13,999. In its previous productions, Gionee has been prioritizing in the camera and the battery because of which it has sustained its presence in the Nepali market. Will the Gionee X1 be able to uphold the same legacy?  I used the phone for a week and tested its marketed features and specifications. Now, I would like to walk you through its detailed review:  Key Specification of Gionee X1:   Dimensions:\xa0144.3 x 72.2 x 8.8 mm (5.68 x 2.84 x 0.35 in)  5 inch HD IPS LCD Display (720 x 1280 pixels and 294 PPI Pixel density), no protection  Android 7.0 Nougat with Amigo UI 4.0 on top  MediaTek (MT6737) SoC with 1.3GHz quad-core, 64-bit processor  2GB DDR3 RAM, 16GB Internal Storage: Expandable up to 128GB via MicroSD card  Rear Camera: 8MP, f/2.2 aperture and LED flash  8MP, f/2.4 aperture Front-Facing Camera  3.5mm audio jack  Connectivity: Dual-SIM (nano+nano), 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, FM Radio, USB OTG  Sensors: Fingerprint (Rear Mounted), compass, gyro, proximity, ambient light  Plastic build, removable back  3000 mAh removable battery  Gionee X1 Price in Nepal: Rs. 13,999   Build and Design  The Gionee X1 has a faux-metal design, that has been designed very convincingly and cleverly.\xa0The device felt really premium while holding but during continuous usage, it kept getting heated up. Hence, at times, it felt really uncomfortable.         The buttons have been placed efficiently on the lateral side of the phone. And as the phone was light, it offered an easy one-hand usability. All in all, the phone felt really smooth and premium besides the occasional warming-up.  Display  The X1 comes with a 5-inch IPS display but lacks a screen protector. More often than not, I have been very prone to accidents, so yes, using the phone without any screen protection was a very cautious experience for me.   The HD (720 x 1280 pixels) with 294 PPI Pixel density display felt a bit too lacking for me. Smartphones within this budget range from brands like\xa0Samsung\xa0have a slightly better display quality. Nonetheless, the display is still decent for its price tag.  Hardware  The phone features power and volume buttons on the lateral side to the right and a 3.5mm slot for a headphone jack at the top. For charging, the device has micro USB 2.0 port at the bottom and features speakers at the back side. The output sound quality is also loud and clear.   The X1 features a really smart fingerprint sensor at the back. The fingerprint sensor is one of the few things I really loved about the phone, as it was really quick and smart enough to keep the contents hidden and unlock the phone whenever necessary.  Software  On the software side, the Gionee X1 features Amigo UI 4.0 paired with Android Nougat. I really liked the UI and the design that it offered, just for its simplicity. Other than that, there is not anything that specific about the phone.  Performance  The smartphone is powered by a MediaTek (MT6737) quad-core processor which is clocked at 1.3GHz speed and comes with a 64-bit processor.  During my use, I had tried testing the limits of the processor of the phone by running multiple heavy apps and games at the same time. And I must say that I was not disappointed. Not once did the device crashed and lit up with a dialogue box pop-up saying “Unfortunately, the app has stopped.”. But, as I said earlier about the display capacity of the phone, my gaming experience was not as good as it could have been with this satisfying processor performance. Also, as the phone kept getting heated u pretty quickly, I had to keep the usage minimalist.  Camera  To speak of the cameras that the phone featured i.e. both 8MP (at the front and at the back), \xa0the pictures taken were good enough with sufficient details to replicate the natural color tone.   The phone features a lot of photography modes like\xa0Night Mode, Professional Mode, Card Scanner, Code Reader, Note Taking and HDR among others. As I have to leave\xa0home early every morning for college, travel during the day for work and return home late in the afternoon travel, I must say I had a good time checking out these features during bus-rides, lunch hours and classroom breaks. With all these inbuilt features in the camera for a smartphone of this budget range, it was certainly a big WOW factor.  Connectivity  The Gionee X1 comes with\xa0Dual-SIM (nano+nano), 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, FM Radio and USB OTG regarding connectivity. As the device is OTG compatible, it can be used to transfer battery juice and files to another device.  Battery  The 3000mAh battery is more than enough to back up and support the phone! The company had said that the phone will provide 209 hours of standby on 4G network, 27 hours of talk time on the 2G network, 18.5 hours of music, and 5 hours of video playback. And, just as promised, the phone provides a decent amount of backup. The device backed me up for a day and a half on normal usage with a couple of games and online applications.   However, as the phone did not contain a quick charge functionality, it felt bothersome to wait for the phone to charge fully.  Verdict  All in all, I must say that I had a really nice time experiencing all the features that the phone has up for offer. I also asked opinions of a few of my friends and acquaintances at work about what their first thought of the phone was. Most of them had good things to say about the phone and all of them had a shocked expression (none could believe that a phone that felt that premium could be priced at Ra. 13,999) painted on their faces once I told them the price of the phone.  What I liked about the Gionee X1?   The smooth and premium design and UI.  The smart and swift fingerprint sensor.  The remarkable 3000mAh battery.  The available modes of photography: card scanner, code reader and many more.  The price-range.   What could have been better in the Gionee X1?   The HD IPS LCD Display (720 x 1280 pixels\xa0HD (720p) is unsatisfying for this price range.  The battery which provides a good backup could have come with some sort of quick charging technology.  The device heated up a lot even on normal usage, which could have been prevented.']",[]

The major purpose of owning a tablet is for multi media consumption which includes watching movies, reading, and gaming. But Apple has reimagined the tablet as a workhorse, made to replace your laptop. Apples 10.5 inch iPad Pro is a prime example of that and now it is officially available in Nepal via GenNext, the official distributor of Apple Products in Nepal.  Like the name suggests, the device comes with a 10.5-inch  retina display  with a resolution of 2224*1668 which measures at 264 ppi. \xa0The most innovative piece of hardware of the device is the display itself as Apple has equipped it with numerous features. To start with, the iPad Pro 10.5 comes with  True Tone Display  which ambiently detects the color temperature of the room and changes the display colors to match it. The display also comes with an  oleophobic coating  which prevents fingerprints on the screen. The display supports  P3 color gamut  for a wide range of colors. The most highlighted feature of the panel is the  Pro Motion Technolgy.  With Pro Motion Technology, the new iPad Pro has a refresh rate of  120Hz . Higher refresh rate makes scrolling on the UI smoother and precise. It also results in low latency(20ms) when using the Apple Pencil for drawing. \xa0The tablet also has  anti-glare protection.  The device is a beast when it comes to performance. Powering the tablet is the Apple’s  A10x fusion chip  with  12-core GPU  which crunches through everything you throw at it. The iPad Pro was made to replace a laptop so its performance is on par with the Apple’s MacBook Pro on benchmarks. It comes with  4GB of RAM.        On the optics side of things, the iPad Pro sports a  12MP  camera with a f/1.8 aperture which is the same sensor found on the iPhone 7. So, it has hands down the best camera on a tablet. The camera also comes with OIS so shooting 4K videos is smooth. It has a  7MP  camera up front with Retina Flash. The tablet comes with 4way stereo speakers so if you want to use it for multimedia consumption you’re going to get the best audio experience. Backing up the device is a  30.4‐watt‐hour battery  which gives backup of up to  10 hours . But on the contrary, it doesn’t support quick charge so it’s going to take a while to get it juiced up.   With iOS 11, the iPad Pro is a productivity machine for those who intend to use it as one. But will it able to replace a working laptop? Well if the price is considered it’s almost close to a high-end windows laptop but when it comes to practicality the tablet still has more things to cover to replace a laptop.

While yesterday and day before yesterday were a quiet day for the market, Lalitpur Mobile Hub’s officials expect the buyer number to increase starting today.         The  previous version of Lalitpur Mobile Expo  saw different schemes and prizes along with some discounts on most of the smartphones and their accessories. But this time around, mobile phone companies are apparently focusing more on discounts rather than gifts. Taking about discounts, over 30 mobile brands are offering 5% to a whopping 70% price deduction on feature phones, smartphones, and different accessories.  The ongoing Lalitpur Mobile Expo 2074 is targeted towards Dashain festival and Lalitpur Mobile Complex’s 4th year anniversary. It features smartphones from international brands such as  Apple ,  Samsung ,  Huawei ,  Gionee ,  HTC ,  Microsoft ,  Lava , etc. The Expo will also see an exclusive launch of some new smartphone brands. Lalitpur Mobile Complex is currently offering smartphones with a price tag ranging from Rs. 900 to Rs. 125,000. While this expo is set to end on 11th September, the Complex is looking forward to a different promotional offer in regards to the upcoming Dashain and Tihar festivals.

['An overview of innovative auto-tech at NADA!'],['NADA'],['By Pratima Adhikari -  '],"['September 3, 2017']",2017-09-03 16:32:24+00:00,"['With NADA happening in the city, it seemed there is nothing else more interesting to talk about. At NADA, we saw passionate automobile companies showcasing their best offerings to automobile enthusiasts, who had their eyes glittering with sparkles of cars and bikes. The offerings presented were so seamlessly speaking for themselves that we couldn’t help but visit every stall and devour what the auto companies had in plate for us. The showstopper was of course the Ford Mustang GT. However, rather than just looking for automobiles with outstanding specs and design, we went hunting for new and smart technologies that came along with normal automobile offerings. Even in the midst of such variety, we were able to handpick new technologies we thought were most innovative.  Ford Mustang | Price: 2,50,00,000  If there is something called impression at first sight, the  Ford Mustang GT  was the same for  us. There was hardly anyone who wasn’t turning heads to spot that monster and why not, it was so extremely satisfactory just to look at it! Well, nobody was allowed to touch the car, which made it beyond desirable. The car was so stylish and sleek in design that it would make anyone drool for it. The Ford Mustang GT is equipped with a 5.0-litre V8 under the hood that unleash a jaw dropping 395.5 bhp and 515 Nm of torque. To tame this power Ford Mustang GT offers driving modes – Norman, Sport+, Track, and Snow/Wet modes. Each mode delivers power output as per the mode’s requirement. This enormous power propels this monster to a top Speed of 250km/hr. The muscle car features an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Ford SYNK2, dual-zone HVAC system, adaptive cruise control, reversing camera, rear diffuser, rain-sensing wipers, and dual front airbags. We are hopeful to here this monster of a car on the streets of Kathmandu as this car goes on sale this year.  TATA Tiago | Price: 22,55,000  The list becomes cooler with the  TATA Tiago  next on it. It’s a regular hatchback powered by 1.2 Litre inline 3-cylinder engine made for the city. If you are a music lover inside out, this is the vehicle for you!\xa0 This car is similar to other cars in the same price bracket, but has managed to outshine with its 8 speaker sound system. Yes, this car is the only auto that has 4 speakers and 4 tweeter sound system developed by Harman. Companies like Jaguar and Landrover also use speakers by Harman and the fact that you are getting the same technology in this car makes it sound even more appealing.\xa0 If I had to describe these speakers, I would say ‘super duper fantastico’ at the least. The car also comes with a ‘Juke Car’ app that allows each passenger to add songs from their device to the car’s playlist which is paired with the car’s audio player. Pairing the speakers with recommended woofers can give the drivers a car theater experience. The rivals in the segment do not stand a chance in bid for this segment- topping multimedia system.         \xa0  KTM Duke 390 |\xa0Price: Rs. 7,09,900  The all new Duke 390 reserves all the stunning features from its predecessor including ride by wire, adjustable brake, and clutch levels and split LED headlights. However, what awed us most was the 5.5 inch TFT display screen that came embedded with a spectacular Bluetooth connectivity. With this feature, your ride can show you who’s calling so you can decide on whether to accept or reject your call. The inconvenience of having to stop and check your calls is now totally out of the equation. It’s not all just tech you get with the new Duke 390, as the beast can unleash 43.5 PS power and 37 NM of torque at a twist of the throttle. To stop this beast you do get the disc on both the wheels equipped with dual channel ABS by BOSCH.    NIU scooters | Price: Rs. 2,65,000  The NIU scooters  are subsequent in the list. \xa0Launched recently in Nepal, this line of fabulous e- scooters is ready to set the pace amongst the queen scooters. These smart scooters are powered by Bosch +FOC power train system that allows you to optimize power consumption, meaning every time you are braking, you are recharging and recycling power back into the system. Once fully charged, these can run for a distance of 80 km range.\xa0 A full charge requires a time of 6 hours and you are ready to explore the city. The stand out feature of this newbie is its smart technology. These scooters have a computer onboard that can be accessed through the NIU app and constantly communicates with the cloud enabling you to get real time information like, Anti-theft alarm, power consumption, navigation to the nearest charge station, etc. With these two-wheelers, you are not just on the environment’s side but you’re on the smart side!    \xa0  MAHINDRA Gusto 125 | Price:1,79,000\xa0  MAHINDRA Gusto 125  shines bright next in the countdown. This scooter with its remote flip key and buzzer has impressed us to limits. Pressing the button on the key makes it flip open like a switch blade and adding more to it, it buzzes to let you spot your ride instantly. The remote flip key comes with a led panel that illuminates the keyhole at night. The find me lamps and remote flip key captivated and awed us for quite some time. Other notable features include, the find me lamps and height adjustable seats. Powering the Gusto 125 is a 124.6cc engine which makes 8.6 bhp of power and 10 Nm of torque mated to a variable roller track CVT transmission.    KIA Soul EV |\xa0Price:58,00,000  Next, on the list we have for you another one of the environment-friendly autos, the  KIA Soul EV . This four wheeler is an all electric five door subcompact crossover SUV manufactured by Kia Motors. This funky vehicle appeals to the eco- friendly as it is a zero emission car and blows away people with its 109-hp motor. The EV powerful motor can accelerate the car from 0 to 100 km/hr in just 11.4 seconds. Powered by lithium- ion battery regenerative braking yield a range of 180 km. The car gets fully charged in 4 hours by fast charging and has impressive heated and cooled leather front seats and a touch screen infotainment system. Now, this is one eco- friendly performer.   So, these were the automobile technologies that we found were on the high grounds. If you have missed visiting NADA, reading this should have made you feel better as this list brings to you a quick and fabulous re- visit to new technologies released this year at NADA. This is just a short synopsis of what caught our tech eyes this year. Next year, we promise to be back with a more detailed auto review of NADA, 2018.

The XZ1 has a nicely refined slim, metal body while the Compact features glass fiber and plastic construction which feels a bit thick and clumsy. International models of the smartphones will be featuring fingerprint scanners too, however, those manufactured in the US won’t have one.

The phone houses a  5.2-inch Full HD display  and is protected with an unspecified version of Gorilla Glass. The phone has 68.2% screen to body ratio due to which it has minimal side bezels but the top and bottom chin are thick. The bottom chin also houses the fingerprint sensor which has support for gestures.         Powering the Moto X4 is a  14nm  based  Snapdragon 630  octa-core chipset clocked at 2.2GHz. The phone comes in 2 variants:\xa03GB of RAM with 32GB ROM and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of RAM. The major highlight of the device is its Dual Camera setup with a dial design on the camera bump.

Another praiseworthy feature of Moto X4 is, it comes with  IP68  water and dust resistant. This is better than the splash protection provided on the flagship,  Moto Z2 . Moto X series was renowned for its hands-free usability and it is back in X4 with the use of  Amazon Alexa . However, this service is only available for European countries. You do have the Google Assistant baked inside the Android. Motorola staying true to its value provides stock Android on Moto X4. The phone will also be getting regular updates for 2 years.  Moto X4 incorporates  Bluetooth 5.0  which enables it to connect to multiple Bluetooth devices. The phone is backed up by a  3,000mAh battery .

['LG V30 Launched: Everything You Need to Know'],"['IFA', 'LG']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['August 31, 2017']",2017-08-31 10:04:27+00:00,"['LG initiated the trend of bezel-less display for 2017 with the launch of  LG G6 . And today at IFA, LG announced its second flagship for the year, the long awaited LG V30 which has a similar aesthetics to the  LG V20  but with a much minimal approach. The phone has removed the gimmicky second display and now stands tall with a bezel-less 6-inch display with 18:9 aspect ratio.  With LG V30, the V-Series has finally dropped the metal body and opted for more premium glass black. The glass back used here is protected by Gorilla Glass 5. The series has also dropped the secondary display up top, which was controversial as it proved to have no principle use. And more importantly, it has opted for OLED panel instead of an IPS panel. So now, LG V30 goes head to head with the Galaxy S8 with a  6-inch Quad HD P-OLED  panel. The phone also somewhat resembles the  Galaxy S8  from the front with round bezels but it doesn’t have an edge display. LG has definitely stepped up its display game this time around.         Like any other flagship, the V30 is powered by the latest  Snapdragon 835  chipset coupled with  4GB of RAM . The performance of this device should be on par with any other flagships. The phone comes in two variants, one with 64GB storage and another with 128GB storage. The phone fortunately still has the option for expansion up to 256GB. The V30 has now addressed few of the essential features like IP68 water and dust resistant, wireless charging, Quad DAC for hi-fi audio and much improvement in the visual aspect. The phone is running on  Android 7.1.2 Nougat  with LG’s own UI on top which, still, is pretty crappy. The phone will be receiving the treat of  Oreo  soon.   LG V-Series is all about its camera performance. The new V30 comes with  Dual Camera  setup, the primary one carries a  16MP  sensor with  f/1.6  aperture and the secondary camera is of  13MP  with  f/1.9  aperture. Both of this camera is covered with  Corning Gorilla Glass 4 . The wide aperture of the camera will certainly help during low-light conditions. The secondary camera is a  wide angle lens  which gives  120 degrees field of view .\xa0The V20 introduced the manual settings while recording video which was first of its kind. In the new V30, it still offers the manual control in videos but it has something more to offer this time. With “Cine Video” mode, the V30 provides  12 Color Grade  options which will step up the video game for more cinematic experience. This mode also enables to tap on something in the frame and zoom on it. While filming, the phone records lossless audio which is a niche feature. The LG V30 is the perfect phone for home grown movie makers and photography enthusiasts. And up front, it comes with a 5MP camera, which doesn’t seem to be compelling in the numbers game.  Also Read:  Best Smartphones of 2017 to buy in Nepal   The LG V30 is backed up by an iffy  3300 mAh battery .

Higher storage is in demand because we have superior cameras on our phones with which we capture thousands of images and videos. The primary storage for these content has been our phone as it’s easier to carry it everywhere we go. With that, Vatsal Impex, the official distributor of  Xiaomi phones in Nepal   has launched the highest variant of Xiaomi MI 6 with  128GB UFS 2.1  storage for the price of  Rs.58,000.  Xiaomi Mi 6  comes in a manageable form factor with a  5.15-inch display . It is a Full HD IPS panel with 428 pixels per inch. The phone is running on  Android 7.1.1 Nougat  with MIUI 8.2 on top. This phone will also be receiving the  Oreo update   in the future. Powering the device is the latest  Snapdragon 835  Chipset coupled with  6GB of RAM . So, when it comes to performance, it is similar to its competitor  OnePlus 5 .         Coming down to the camera, the phone carries a  Dual 12MP Camera  setup where the secondary camera is a telephoto lens which provides  2x optical zoom . It works on the same principle as the  iPhone 7 Plus . With optical zoom, you can zoom without losing any quality and details. This setup also provides shooting  Portrait Photos \xa0with Bokeh effect. It can shoot  4K videos at 30fps  and has Optical Image Stabilization(OIS). The phone is also somewhat  Splash\xa0Resistant  which enables you to use this phone in the rain. And up front, it has  8MP Selfie Camera,  but, without a selfie flash as it has become a norm in smartphones.  For those who think 128GB storage of Xiaomi Mi 6 is overkill; the phone doesn’t come with expansion option. So when you have a Dual Camera setup that can shoot high-resolution images and 4K videos, you’ll soon be running out of storage. So this high-end version of  Xiaomi MI 6  is basically for those who do a lot of shooting with this device or use it primarily as a multimedia tool. Also, the 128GB variant comes with  ceramic body  giving it a more premium appeal.  The Xiaomi Mi 6 also doesn’t\xa0carry a headphone jack.

With the mid-range phone being launched every other day, this phone packs nothing remarkable in terms of specs. And the Note tag in its name suggests it comes with a bigger 5.5-inch display. The primary focus of the device is on its Dual Camera setup. Let’s see what else the phone has to offer.  The Meizu M6 Note comes with  Full HD 5.5-inch display  (1080 x 1920 pixels) @401 ppi. Protection used for the display hasn’t been mentioned. It is running Flyme OS 6.0 on top of\xa0 Android\xa07.1.2 Nougat , however, Meizu phones do not have good track record for updates, so  Android Oreo  may be just a name of a treat for its users. The phone comes with an unibody metal construct with a minimal design approach. The front houses a fingerprint sensor which can also be used for gestures for navigation. The back houses a Dual Camera along with Dual LED flash.         Meizu M6 Note is powered by a 14nm\xa0 Snapdragon 625  Octa Core Chipset clocked at 2GHz. The 14nm size of the chip makes the processor energy efficient and also delivers power when required as seen on the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 . For graphical performance, it comes with  Adreno 506 GPU . The phone comes in 3 variants: 3GB RAM – 16GB Storage, \xa03GB RAM – 32GB Storage and 4GB RAM – 64GB Storage.  Let’s talk about the feature highlight of the phone. The Dual Camera setup comes in  12MP+5MP  arrangement with f/1.9 aperture. The Dual Camera assists in adding bokeh to the photo. The rear also sports dual pixel sensor for faster focus. Up front, the phone houses a  16MP  camera with f/.2.0 aperture but it doesn’t have a selfie flash.   It has Dual SIM capability along with support for Micro SD card expansion up to 256GB. The M6 Note also comes with  USB Type-C  which is good to see on a mid-range device. It also comes with all the necessary sensors including the  Gyroscope  if you want to enjoy VR content with your device. Backing up the M6 Note is a  4,000mAh  battery along with  mCharge\xa0(Meizu’s Fast Charging).  With a power efficient\xa0processor, decent specs, and massive battery, you’ll supposedly get a battery life from the device.

Yes, I am talking about the  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 , the phone which was earning accolades until its battery started to give up. In response to the numerous fire incidents, Samsung discontinued the device and recalled each one of them as well.   While many had expected Samsung to stay put with its flagship of 2017 –  the Galaxy S8 and S8+ , the company has unveiled a new member of the Note-series – the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The  Note 8 is priced at Rs. 10,2990  and will be available from Oct 10 in Nepal. Samsung Nepal is also offering 8 months breakage insurance, 2GB Ncell data per month for 6 months, and a free wireless charger on the purchase of the phone.        Don’t Miss:  Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ Full Review  Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Specifications:  The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 looks much like the Galaxy S8 with sharp edges. It has a 6.3-inch quad HD Super AMOLED Infinity display with the resolution of 1440 x 2960 pixels. It has 83.2% of screen-to-body ratio and an 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The device, like its siblings, is powered by Exynos 8895 in the market except for the USA, and by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in the USA. This processor is aided by 6 GB of RAM – something we don’t really see in high-end smartphones from Samsung.   Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be available in three storage options – 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB. This can be further expanded up to 256 GB from the microSD card slot. The device runs on Android v7.1.1 Nougat right out of the box and will receive the Oreo update sometime in the near future.  Most of its specifications are similar to that of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+. It even shares the fingerprint sensor’s placement. So, what features make this smartphone different from its siblings? Well, there is a major change starting with the Galaxy Note 8. Samsung has officially registered itself as another company to have dual camera lenses on the back. Both the cameras measure 12-megapixel and are capable of taking wide-angle photographs and a somewhat iPhone-like portrait mode pictures.   Like all other Note devices, the Note 8 too comes with a stylus. The stylus helps users take notes on the go and also to run through the device’s interface. Users will now be able to share animated texts and pictures in the form of GIFs using the stylus. The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 also has Bixby assistant installed. Like the Galaxy S8, Bixby has a different hardware button on the side.   One thing I am not satisfied with in the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is the battery. A 3,300 mAh battery powers the device with 6.3-inch of quad HD display.  Samsung Galaxy Note 8: Price and Initial Impressions  The Galaxy Note 8 is Samsung’s most expensive phone ever. In the United States of America, the smartphone will be available for around $930 at T-Mobile while the Sprint and Verizon ones could run for $960, and that’s all just for the baseline 64 GB model.   So how much is it going to cost in Nepal? Well, we could see the prices go above Rs. 100,000. This will indeed make the Note 8 Samsung’s most expensive device anywhere.  Samsung Galaxy Note 8: Availability in Nepal  In the international market, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will start shipping on 15th September. Regarding its availability in Nepal, you can preorder the phone for Rs. 102990 from the nearest Samsung outlets.

And like always, a new mid-ranger from Huawei, dubbed with  Huawei Y7 Prime  brought a similar feeling among us. Tagged with the price of Rs.24,900 Huawei Y7 Prime comes with the primary focus on the battery. Huawei is renowned for the decent specs and superior performance even on low and mid-range phones providing a proper value for money and for this reason, the brand has a stronghold on Nepali smartphone market. But will this newbie help the Huawei to continue the trend? Will this device provide the promised specs and performance? Let’s find out in this review.  Huawei Y7 Prime Specs   Dimensions: 153.6 x 76.4 x 8.4 mm; Weight: 165 grams  5.5-inch HD IPS LCD Display with 2.5D curved glass (@267 PPI Pixel density)  Android 7.0 Nougat with EMUI 5.1 on the top  Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 (1.4GHz Octa-core)\xa0CPU  3GB RAM, 32GB Internal Storage  Memory Expandable up to 128GB (uses SIM2 Slot)  Rear Camera: 12MP, f/2.2 aperture, 1/2.9″ sensor size, 1.25 µm pixel size with\xa0Phase Detection Autofocus and LED flash  8MP Front-Facing Camera  Connectivity: Dual-SIM (micro+nano), 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.1, A-GPS, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, FM Radio, USB OTG  Sensors: Fingerprint (Rear Mounted), accelerometer, ambient light, proximity, compass  Li-Ion 4000 mAh battery  Huawei Y7 Prime Price in Nepal: Rs. 24,900   Design and Build  Huawei Y7 Prime has a plastic back enclosed inside a metallic frame. However, the device has been cleverly and convincingly designed and colored to give the looks and feel of a metallic body.         The device felt premium on the hold but because of the metallic edges, the device frequently slipped through my hands on the use. The design also includes a generous amount of bezel on the chin, which is so unconvincing for the phone with on-screen buttons.   Display  Y7 Prime carries a 5.5-inch IPS display with 2.5D curved glass toppings. The display lacks protection and I opted to use a screen protector so I could not go to feel the curvy edges on the phone. Gaming and multimedia is not quite enjoyable on the phone with a huge screen and lower resolution and Y7 Prime has not been an exception. So the 720p resolution has been the major disappointment on the phone.   Hardware  The phone has power and volume rockers on the right and SIM+SDcard slot on the left. There is a place for the 3.5mm headphone jack dwelling on the top edge of the phone. For the charging, the device has micro USB 2.0 port on the bottom edge with speaker grills on the left and right. However, sound output only comes from the right grill. The output sound quality is decent and loud. On the top, there is a tiny LED, which blinks alerting about the notifications.   Talking about the sensors, Huawei Y7 Prime inherits Fingerprint, accelerometer, ambient light, proximity and compass sensors. The fingerprint sensor is the most impressive piece of hardware on the phone, which resides on the back. The Fingerprint on the phone is accurate and unlocks the device without a hitch. In addition, it can be used to snap photos, read notifications and swipe files in the gallery. And the presence of ambient light sensor saves the trouble of readjusting the brightness under different lighting conditions. However, gyro sensor is missing on the phone, whose absence will be duly felt on the use.  Software  On the software side, Huawei Y7 Prime comes with EMUI 5.1 based on the latest Android Nougat. The UI offers an option to select an app drawer or to leave the apps scattered on the home screen. For the rest of the features, the UI is nothing out of ordinary and does inherit some unnecessary bloatware.      Huawei Y7 Prime Review - Software Screenshots   1  of 5                                                                    Performance  Powering the Huawei Y7 Prime is mediocre Snapdragon 435 chipset. Clocked at 1.4GHz speed, Snapdragon 435 is an underpowered chipset and the performance on this device is not the best you will get in this price bracket.   On my use, the device performed well with low-end games and multitasking with light apps. However, on the high-end games, there were stutters and drop in frame rates usurping my fun in the most cases. The experience on low-end games was not good either with the phone heating up frequently. While playing low-end games, the phone heated up as early as 15 minutes of use. Even with the apps like Facebook and Instagram, the device heated up in half an hour or earlier. Though the phone has 3GB of RAM, with the RAM usage of 2GB or more, the device froze most of the time.  Camera  Moving on to the camera, Huawei Y7 Prime embraces 12MP camera on the back. The shots taken from the rear camera packs a sufficient amount of details and replicates a natural color tone. However, I felt shutter lags while taking photos. In addition, there were no impressive changes with the images taken with HDR on and off. The images from the selfie shooter were not bad either. Bringing out most of the details, the 8MP front camera produces social media ready images and the beautify mode built in with the camera app provides a stronger assist. Even on the low lights, the camera performs well with minimal noises and grains. On the videography side, the phone is capable of shooting Full-HD (1080p) at 30fps frame rate. The phone also has inbuilt Slo-mo and Time-lapse features on the videography side.        1  of 5                                    hdr                                  Connectivity  For the connectivity, Huawei Y7 Prime packs 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, A-GPS, FM Radio, Bluetooth v4.1 and micro USB 2.0. The device is also OTG compatible, which can be used to transfer the battery juice to another device in addition to transferring data and files. Though the device is capable of running Dual-SIM on standby, the phone comes with an internal storage of 32GB with one fourth of the space devoured by the system firmware. So in the case of insufficiency, microSD card will be the option with the expandable capability up to 256GB. But since the MicroSD card uses the SIM2 slot for this purpose, which cuts you from the privilege to use dual-SIM on the standby.  Battery  The battery is the USP of the phone with the capacity of 4000mAh. As promised, the phone provides a decent amount of backup. Even while playing high-end games rigorously with full brightness and Wi-Fi on, the phone lasted for around six hours. The device backed me up for a day and a half on the normal usage. Yet there were, even more, options to prolong backup and optimize battery life. However, the phone is sluggish in the matter of charging. The phone lacks quick charging and takes a little more than 3 hours to get the charging fully done.        1  of 3                                                Verdict  To sum it up, with a little potential on the camera, Huawei Y7 Prime has nothing best to offer except for its massive battery. And in the similar price bracket, there are many other smartphones, which supersedes the Huawei Y7 Prime in every possible aspect including the battery. So I see nothing remarkable to suggest our followers go for Huawei Y7 Prime.  What do I like about the\xa0Huawei Y7 Prime?   The massive 4000mAh is remarkable on the phone, which provides a prolonged backup.  The fingerprint on the device is snappy suited with the capability to unlock almost instantaneously.   What I disliked about the\xa0Huawei Y7 Prime?   The device display is of HD (720p) resolution offering a poor pixel density for the price.  The Snapdragon 435 chipset equipped on the phone is an average performer.  To charge the massive battery it does not come with quick charge technology.  The device heats up a lot even on the normal usage.  The device lacks gyro sensor, which cuts the privilege to play VR games and watch 360-degree videos.

['Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Review: Large Screen monster'],"['Android', 'Reviews', 'Xiaomi']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['August 22, 2017']",2017-08-22 09:37:21+00:00,"['Over the years, a smartphone’s display size has increased exponentially. It had previously started with the bar phones, which later changed into a 4-inch smartphone. The average display size of smartphones these days is around 5.5-inch but manufacturers are pushing limits. A certain group of smartphone users has opted for multimedia experience in their device. This multimedia experience has taken over one-handed usability for some of them. So, companies like  Xiaomi  launch bigger phablets for this specific purpose. The  Xiaomi Mi Max 2  is a prime example of that. With a bigger display, this device is here in Nepal. But does this device perform well in real life? Let’s find out in this review.  Xiaomi Mi Max 2 in a nutshell:   6.44-inch Full HD IPS 2.5D curved glass display  2GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 625 SoC with Adreno 506 GPU  4GB RAM with 64GB; expandable memory with microSD  MIUI 8\xa0based on Android 7.1.1 (Nougat)  Hybrid Dual SIM (micro+nano/microSD)  12MP rear camera with dual-tone LED Flash,\xa0PDAF, f/2.2 aperture,\xa0Sony IMX386 sensor, 1.25μm pixel size  5MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture  3.5mm audio jack, dual stereo speakers  Fingerprint sensor, infrared sensor  Dimensions: 174.1×88.7×7.6mm  Weight: 211gms  4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS,\xa0USB Type-C  5300mAh battery with\xa0Quick Charge 3.0   Design and Display    The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is a tall device, like really, really tall. Its standout feature is the humongous 6.44-inch display. Out of all the devices, I have reviews, only the Mi Max 2 didn’t fit in my pocket. It has a tall display which is accompanied by two large bezels. But I really enjoyed using this phablet as my primary driver since I am inclined towards bigger displays.        At the back, the Mi Max 2 has a minimalistic design. It has two antenna bands like that in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. There is a fingerprint scanner on the back which, even with the large footprint of the device, is easy to use. A rear-facing camera sits on the top-corner of the device.   However, I still have a hard time using the device properly. The bigger display means that I always must extend my hand awkwardly and the fact that the device’s aluminum back is slippery means that the device tends to drop down from my hands. So, even though the metallic body of the Xiaomi Mi Max is premium, I suggest you cover it with a casing.  The multimedia experience on this device is top-notch. If you like gaming or watching videos on your smartphone, this could be the device for you. I could be nitpicking here, but I really hate black bands around any smartphone’s display and the Mi Max features the band. Come on, Xiaomi, a company like you should discard this completely.  Nonetheless, the display is nothing short of amazing. Even though bigger display means pushing more pixels, I thoroughly enjoyed the well saturated and bright display of the Xiaomi Mi Max 2. I will certainly miss that huge display, whenever I watch GadgetByte’s YouTube videos. [socialpoll id=”2380061″] Camera   Now onto the device’s camera. Xiaomi isn’t really praised for its camera performance. We have reviewed lots of Xiaomi devices and arguably, all the devices have come up short on this feature. Well, I still have mixed feelings about the Mi Max 2’s camera. Whenever you take some pictures and view it on the device, the images seem to be washed out and unsaturated, all whilst lacking dynamic range. And whenever I viewed these pictures on my computer, some of them were decent enough, but most lacked the aforementioned qualities. Also, under dark environment, the pictures come out way too noisy. So, I have to say that Xiaomi has once again fallen short in the camera department of its smartphone.                               The front camera of the device measures 5-megapixel and takes some social media worthy selfies. It shines under bright light, but like the device’s rear camera, it isn’t good under lack of lighting.  Performance   Now on to the major aspect of any smartphone – performance. The Xiaomi Mi Max 2, with its Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor performs relatively well under normal usage. But it doesn’t handle everything I throw at it whenever I asked more from the device. It sometimes stuttered here and there, and sometimes even took a bit of time while opening an app.  I am not really a gamer, but I did play a couple of games on the smartphone. It handles gaming nicely but sometimes it does lag. I have to say that with the Snapdragon 625, you can expect the device to handle your day-to-day usage quite nicely.  Hardware   The Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is available in a single storage variant. Well, I used the same 64 GB option of the device as my review unit. I could carry around one of my favorite TV series to watch it on the go with ease. However, the storage did fill up sometimes, but as long as you expand it, you will have no issues at all.  Now on to the fingerprint of the device, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 has one of the fastest fingerprint scanners around. It is blazing fast and I still can’t figure out any issues with it. There is also an IR sensor alongside the 3.5 mm headphone jack.  Talking about the Mi Max 2’s dual speakers at the bottom, they are really loud. Unlike some other smartphones, both of the speaker grills work and give off stereo sound effect. Xiaomi has made this Rs. 35,000 worth of device future proof by equipping it with a USB Type-C connector. This connector also helps in faster charging.  Software             I am personally inclined towards a stock-ish software experience. The software is one of the major aspects I look at before I buy a smartphone. Yet I have never really had a problem using Xiaomi’s Mi UI. The interface has simplistic design and is user-friendly to some extent as well.  Xiaomi Mi Max 2 runs on the Chinese manufacturer’s very own Mi UI 8.5 on top of Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Like every other Xiaomi smartphone, this device also comes loaded with different software features. It still has the dual app feature, different gestures, and a ‘guest mode-ish’ mode as well.  Connectivity   Like most smartphones these days, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 houses dual SIM slot. But unlike all of them, the Chinese company has included a Nano and a Micro SIM card slot. The call quality of the device is quite good as no one from the other end actually complained anything.  The smartphone supports the much-needed 4G connectivity. It also has a gyro sensor for a good VR experience which goes well with the 6.44-inch display.  Battery   Now moving on to the battery, the Xiaomi Mi Max 3 houses a pretty huge battery of 5,300 mAh. Due to its huge capacity, the device easily ran for more than 2 days. Even under heavy gaming and usage, its battery level doesn’t deplete that much. I wasn’t expecting this much juice as the device has a large display. It is commendable that Xiaomi went with a ‘max’ battery on a ‘max’ smartphone. And the addition of quick charge 3.0 is a cherry on top.  Conclusion   All in all, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is a large smartphone which perfectly suits the multimedia needs of the people. It has a 5,300 mAh which perfectly complements the smartphone. It is a good-looking smartphone with a minimalistic design. Yes, the smartphone could be too tall for some people, and yes it doesn’t really have a top-quality camera sensor, but for someone who is into a big display, either for gaming or any other multimedia purpose, it could exactly be the device they are looking for.

['Android 8.0 Oreo is Official: Everything you need to Know'],['Android'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['August 22, 2017']",2017-08-22 08:20:26+00:00,"['Unlike in the past, we don’t have to wait to see what are the major changes in the latest version of Android. Google has been rapidly dropping latest features via the Public Beta channels for Nexus and Pixel Devices. By looking at the beta images, we could already tell the features that were ready for us in the next big release of 8.0 except for the name! So today, Google has officially\xa0released the stable version of  Android 8.0  code name  Oreo.  So let’s see what are the major features and improvements in Android 8.0 Oreo.  Picture in Picture   The picture in Picture feature will simply change the way you multitask while you’re watching a video on YouTube, Chrome, VLC and more apps to come. If you are wondering what this feature is all about, then look no further! You have been using it for years one way or another. While using the Youtube app in portrait mode, you can swipe down to minimize the player and continue to browse other videos. That’s picture in picture within an app. Also, you can take the example of Facebook Messenger, where you can minimize the video chat window and continue using your phone and other apps. Android O just has better support and stability for this feature and we’ll be seeing more apps with this features in the days to come.        Autofill Passwords   Autofill Passwords is the single most important feature rolling out on Android Oreo. With the AutoFill API, password manager apps will be able to log you into apps lot more easily. LastPass Password Manager app already supports Autofill as a beta feature. With this, if you want to login to a certain app, Password Manager will kick in giving you options which account to log in and you can simply log in to the app without any hassles of typing your password. This feature will save you a lot of time and trouble.  Notification Dots   Notification Dots is something that should have been added in Android years ago. A lot of third-party launchers had this feature for years which showed badges on the app icon to show – you have unchecked notification from that app. Android Oreo not only shows you notifications dots but on long pressing the app icon, it will show you what notifications you have. It is a pretty neat feature. Also talking about notifications you can now snooze the notifications and make it appear after certain time. You can also choose what sort of notifications to allow from the app but this feature as of now is available only on Google Apps.  Smart Text Selection   Smart Text Selection is going to make using Android a whole lot easier. With this feature, Android will be able to tell what type of text you’re selecting, whether it’s an address or a phone number. \xa0Whenever you select an address or phone number, Android will show you the option to open that address on Google Maps and call using the selected phone number respectively. And if it cannot sort out what it is, it’ll provide you an option for web\xa0search. This feature is still a work in progress, we can expect other uses of this feature in the future.  Adaptive Icons  Image: Cristian Ruiz  Adaptive Icons is something straight out of Chinese OEM’s. If you have used any skinned third party Chinese OEM’s like MIUI, MiFavor UI or any other for that matter, you might have noticed how there are different icon shapes you can choose, it’s exactly that. There are five different options to choose from, namely, System Default(native app icon), Square, Rounded Square, Squircle, and Teardrop. Not to forget, Android Oreo will maintain the same size of icons across the board for uniformity.  Background Apps   There has been a lot of changes internally to make Android more optimized. There are multiple social media apps and other apps that run in the background and draws a lot of your battery. Well, that’s about to change with Android Oreo. Apps will have few intelligent wake locks which will ensure apps do not run in the background all the time resulting in better RAM management and memory. It will also limit the frequency of location updates in the background.  New Emojis   Emojis are something we use all the time and good looking emojis will certainly make your conversation a whole lot sassier. Android Oreo now comes with new sets of emojis replacing the blob emojis. The new emojis are more expressive and provides new characters and actions. This certainly looks better than the previous version.  Project Treble  Project Treble is less talked of and less heard of feature\xa0that ships with Android Oreo. But if done right, it can be a life-changing feature for all the Android users. Simply, Project Treble enables manufacturers to make it easy to push Android updates to their devices. A lot of manufacturers have multiple devices across the board with their own native UI and functionalities of some sort. Pushing update to all of these devices is a hassle as they have to work from the ground up to create the new update with their distinguishing feature. With Project Treble, it’ll keep the vendors’ implementation or changes on the device as it is and lets them easily push the updates. Well, it’s available starting with Android O and if manufacturers decide to use it, let’s just say Android and iOS update battle will finally settle for good.  Android Go   Announced back in Google I/O conference, Android Go will be shipping with the start of Android Oreo. Android Go is a lightweight version of Android Oreo with all of its features but optimized for devices with limited resources(less RAM and storage). This OS primarily focuses on using less android resource along with fewer data packages when you’re surfing the internet. Device shipping with Android GO will have lightweight or optimized version of Google Core apps. And on Play Store, there’ll be a separate section called “Optimized for your Device” which will list lightweight apps like Facebook Lite, Youtube Go, Messenger Lite and so on. Devices with Android Go start shipping only from 2018.  Factory Image of Android 8 Oreo for Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel and Pixel XL is now available for download.

The main highlight of the phone is certainly the Dual Rear Camera where the primary shooter is  12MP  and the accompanying wide angle sensor is of 8MP. Up front, it has a  16MP camera  which will offer  4K recording . If it ships with that front 4K recording, it’ll be the first phone in the world to have that feature.

In a scenario where all of us are more or less consistently hung up on our smartphones, it certainly is heart breaking to lose or damage them. But life rarely goes as we plan it and all of us either end up damaging or at worse case scenarios – losing our smartphones. Not only does that burn a huge hole in our wallets but also makes us feel really sad and disturbed. Only recently, I lost my smartphone. And, I tell you, the blow of it is really, really indescribable. However, I came across the latest post of Xiaomi Nepal and couldn’t help but feel happy with their new plan.  Understanding the present situation, where over 50% of people worldwide have had a crack running across their smartphone screen at least once (in case of Nepal: 65%),  Xiaomi Nepal  has initiated a new idea: Mi Phone Insurance. According to this, customers will be provided with a very special insurance offer on every purchase of Xiaomi smartphones. This ensures our devices with theft protection, physical damage, accidental damage and also provides extended service warranty. That was something you would have loved to hear before you’d lost or broken your phone, wasn’t it?  Two criteria for insurance claim have been stated by the company:         Accidental damage  Stolen device (police report is a must)   One can claim up to 85% within the six months time period after sales and 50% after six months. This policy will be made effective from 8th August 2017 and will be applicable for the products bought after that date.  Previously, this breakage insurance policy was only made available for high-end smartphones like  Samsung Galaxy S8  and  Huawei P10 Plus . This initiative taken by Vatsal Impex, the authorized distributor of  Xiaomi products in Nepal ,\xa0to introduce insurance policy for budget smartphones is indeed a commendable deed. Vatsal Impex was previously criticized for pricing the products at a much higher rate than in the Indian and Chinese market. But, introducing this sort of value added service under their wings provides them with a better platform to reach out to more and more customers for a reasonable price. Undoubtedly, this step taken by Vatsal Impex will prove to be a smart and strong marketing strategy to promote sales of the attractive, wide range of products from Xiaomi: \xa0Redmi 3s, Mi 5, Mi 6, Mi Max, Redmi 4X and much more.  For now, the only thing we can hope for is that other distributors and flagship holders will follow suit and come up with more interesting and innovative ideas to encourage people to invest in their products.

No matter how complex and dull the name sounds, it is no match for the specifications and key features that it has. It is not a matter of surprise that Samsung came up with yet another historic idea with this phone as Samsung has been showing its love and support for the smartphone evolution. Undoubtedly, flip phones occupy a huge part of this evolution. Earlier, it had launched the Galaxy Folder in 2015, the Galaxy Folder 2 in 2016, and then the Samsung W2017 last November. Each of these models was sold in limited editions. The case with this phone is also the same as the handset has only been announced for China Mobile in China.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/samsung-leader-8-SM-G9298.jpg']

The company’s stocks reached a record high of $159.10 thanks to iPhone sales.  Not just the iPhones but even iPad has seen a growth in sales after three years of decline. The increase in sales is also due to the sheer fact that there are a lot cheaper iPad available now. The total iPad sales in numbers were 11.42 million units this quarter.

It’s called the Gionee A1 Lite, which like its big brother, is also a selfie-oriented Smartphone. With Lite attached to its name, it certainly is a toned down version of the  Gionee A1 . So, how does the Gionee A1 lite fare when used as a daily driver? Let’s find out if this  Rs. 25,999  phone is worth buying.   Gionee A1 Lite Specs:   Display:  5.3 inch IPS display with 1280*720 pixel (282 ppi)  Protection:  2.5D curved glass with Corning Gorilla Glass 3  Processor : 1.3 GHz \xa0Octa-core 64 bit MediaTek MT6753 Soc with\xa0Mali-T720MP3 GPU  Front Camera: \xa020MP f/2.0 aperture lens, LED flash  Rear Camera:  13 MP f/2.0\xa0 aperture lens, phase detection autofocus, dual-LED flash  RAM:  3GB  ROM:  32GB; microSD upto 128GB (dedicated slot)  OS:  Android 7.0 Nougat with Amigo 4.0 on top  Battery:  Non-removable Li-Ion 4000 mAh  Sensors:  Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity, Compass  Fingerprint : Yes  Connectivity:  Dual SIM with 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS  Color:  Red, Black, and Gold  Price:  Rs. 25,999 (USD 255)   Camera  Gionee A1 Lite houses a 13MP F/2.0 aperture rear camera with Dual LED Flash.  The highlight of the Gionee A1 Lite is its massive  20 MP front-facing camera  which is backed by F2.0 aperture lens and a LED flash. It is absolutely amazing and captures selfies with  sharp and rich detail , with little noise. Even in low light, the camera is decent enough to win everyone’s, heart. Surprisingly, it can captures selfies in dark environment without the need for the front LED flash. When turned on, the front flash illuminates the whole area.            Front Camera Gallary   1  of 8               Selfie Shot from Front 20MP sensor outdoors         Gionee A1 Lite Indoor Selfie          Girls Groupie          Groupie         Bright Background Burned         Clear Selfie in Sunlight         Ambient Clear Selfie         Selfie in the Evening                                    The 13 MP primary camera on the A1 lite is based on Sony IMX sensor, which is marketed as a super camera phone. It offers 1.12-micron pixel size which is coupled with a f/2.0 lens.\xa0It also has a dual-tone LED flash and a phase detection for better and faster autofocus.  In terms of rear camera performance, the Gionee A1 produces decent results. The color reproduction is as good as high-end phones and the photos come out a bit washed out when the light is not ample and the dynamic range could have been better. Turning on HDR does help to some extent. However, I am satisfied with the rear camera performance and they are more than enough for the phone’s price range.

Design  Gionee A1 Lite has an Aluminum Back with 2.5D glass on top of the display  Gionee A1 Lite is a stylish and a sleek-looking phone. The device’s internals is sandwiched between glass protection on the front and a smooth aluminum back. On the back, you get the fingerprint sensor right above Gionee’s Logo. A speaker grill can be found on the edge of the aluminum back. The phone is surprisingly light and gives a premium feel. However, the smoothness of the aluminum back has resulted in an extremely slippery device.   The earphone and the micro USB port are at the bottom of the device with the volume rocker and the power button on the right side of the screen. A SIM tray supporting dual SIMS and a microSD card slot sits on the left. The rear facing fingerprint is easy to set up and unlocks the phone very fast.  Display  A1 Lite has a 5.3 inch IPS HD 1280*720p display  Gionee A1 comes with a 5.3-inch 720p HD IPS display and gorilla glass 3 protection. Even though the resolution is low for a large 5.3-inch display, the display here is a quality one. The color saturation is rich and its brightness level is sufficient for outdoor use. However, the glass panel is quite reflective in sunlight.  Performance      Geekbench 4 Screenshots   1  of 5               Geekbench Score         Geekbench Single Core Comparision         Geekbench Single Core Comparision detail         Geekbench Multi Core Comparision         Geekbench Multi Core Comparision detail                           The Gionee A1 Lite is powered by an Octa-core MediaTek MT6753 processor clocked at 1.3 GHz. The processor could do its deed for normal users. But for power users like me, the processor underperforms. While multitasking, I experienced frequent lags. Sometimes the apps forced closed and the 3 GB of RAM came to no help.  The MALI GPU is best for mid-end games such as Gunship Battle, Real Racing and Clash of Clans. Having said that, the phone does heat up a lot during heavy usage. Even when recording 1080P videos for\xa0a longer period of time, the device gets heated. I guess this is the biggest drawback of the mediocre MediaTek processor.  Battery  A1 Lite sports a massive 4000 mAH battery underneath the smooth aluminum back  Unlike the underperforming MediaTek processor and a low-resolution screen, the Gionee A1 Lite’s battery powers the device quite well. The phone is backed by a 4000 mAH battery, which is plenty for me. In regular use with 4G network enabled and Wi-Fi connected, I got around 6 and a half hours of screen-on-time. It took me a full day and 2 hours to drain the battery to 5%. All in all, it can easily last all day with normal or heavy usage. I wished the phone came equipped with quick charging capability to charge that massive 4000mAH battery. It would have been a treat to charge the phone in 1 to 1.5 hours.      Battery Screenshot   1  of 2               Screen On Time         Battery Graph                  Software  Gionee A1 Lite runs on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat with Amigo 4.0 UI on top.  Talking about its software, the Gionee A1 Lite runs on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat version with Amigo 4.0 UI on top. I really liked its simple yet elegant UI. There are a lot of features embedded on to the OS, but it rather felt cluttered. I actually had a hard time searching for the options manually. Also, the UI is buggy as the UI crashes frequently. I hope this gets fixed by future updates.      UI Screenshots   1  of 8               Home Screen         Settings         Launcher Menu         Desktop Setting         UI Update App         System Manager         Gionee Weather App         Gionee Weather App detail                                    With Android 7.0 Nougat, you do get all the stock Nougat features. The split screen mode, quick reply from notifications and grouping of notifications of the same app are all embedded in the UI. The phone also supports different smart gestures with flash notification. Sadly, the Gionee A1’s edge bar functionality which is accessed by swiping on the fingerprint sensor to launch favorite apps and tasks is not included in this device.  Conclusion   To sum it all up, Gionee A1 Lite does live up to the tagline of ‘super selfie, super battery’. But if you’re looking for a device that delivers a good performance, this might not be the best phone for you.   What do I like about the\xa0 Gionee A1 Lite ?   Firstly, the massive 20 MP camera is the best thing about this device which captures images with awesome detail.  Then comes its thin and sleek design with aluminum back surrounding the phone which gives the Gionee A1 Lite a premium feel.  The 4000mAh battery which gives you the freedom to use this device all day.   What I disliked about the\xa0 Gionee A1 Lite ?   The MediaTek MT6753 Octa Core processor is not ideal for gaming and heavy multitasking.  To charge the massive battery it doesn’t come equipped with quick charge technology.  The device heats up a lot during usage and the heated aluminum back becomes uncomfortable at times.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Untitled-1.png']

At the end of last month, Tesla organized an event to distribute 20 of its production cars to its customers who had booked them well over a year ago. In total Tesla made 50 production cars last month out of which 20 went on for post production\xa0testing, and 30 were meant for the customers. This event was as usual hosted by the CEO of Tesla – Elon Musk.   Tesla Model 3  Tesla Model 3 is the world’s most affordable pure electric car with the longest range of 300 miles. It’s base priced model is priced at  the US $35,000 . Tesla is making two variants of the model 3. The\xa0Standard option will be the base variant that will have a range of  220 miles . It will go 0-60mph in 5.6 seconds and will have a top speed of 130 mph. On the other hand, the  Long range variant  will have 310 miles of range and an acceleration of 5.1 seconds. It will have a top speed of 140 mph.        The surprising fact of the Model 3 is that it will not have a driver instrumentation panel like that of the Model S. There will be a large 15-inch center infotainment screen that will display all the required information. Elon Musk says that the future\xa0cars will be more or less autonomous. Therefore, a driver doesn’t need to gaze upon the instrumentation panel constantly. All the speed, range, lane requirements will continuously be\xa0monitored by computers onboard in the car. The base version of Model 3 will come as a standard with autonomous hardware and fast charging capabilities.   Model 3 Production  Tesla is in plans to meet the initial\xa0production target of  5 thousand cars a week . They are hopeful that they can produce 10 thousand vehicles a week later on.\xa0In the event, Elon Musk emotionally thanked the customers who bought the Model S and the Model X. This helped them build the insanely\xa0cheap Model 3 for the masses. He also stated that if customers order a Model 3 now, they will get it within a year. But if they order a Model S or a Model X as of now,\xa0 they will get it in about 1 to 2 months.  What’s happening here in Nepal?   After the fuel crisis in 2016, sales of electric\xa0scooters started blooming here in Kathmandu. Now, as the crisis of gas is at its minimum, people have forgotten the misery of the crisis. The only electric car that is being sold here in Nepal is the\xa0Mahindra e2o priced at 25 lakhs. If the production of fuel declines in the world, developing countries like ours will be the first to get hit by the crisis.

Ryzen 3 1200 costs $109 (NRs. 11,500) whereas the 1300X will cost you about $129 (NRs. 13,500).  Ryzen 3 1200 has four cores with four threads with a base clock of 3.1GHz and boost clock of 3.4GHz.

Both processors are compatible with X370, B350 and A320 motherboards.  And both processors are based on the socket AM4 platform. The biggest downside of Ryzen processors is they also don’t come with onboard GPU.  These new processors from AMD will compete with Intel’s Core i3 processors (7100U), which are all dual core processors with four threads.  And both the processors are overclockable as well, though, only supported on the B350 motherboard. The i3s are overclockable too, but you will need a more expensive Z270 motherboard.

Samsung Galaxy Note 8  The Galaxy Note 8 leaks yet again, but this time it’s the camera in question. We have seen multiple leaks of Note 8 featuring dual camera setup. Now, new leaks hint at a dual camera with a telephoto lens capable of 3x zoom and now\xa0has augmented\xa0prediction.  One of the lenses is a 13MP sensor for wide angle and another with a 12MP sensor for telephoto — both with optical image stabilization.        Samsung has confirmed the release date of August 23 for the Note 8.  LG V30  The LG V30’s back panel leaks hint at a dual camera setup, a fingerprint sensor in the middle and the flash along side the camera. This time around the phone is rumored to have wireless charging.   Lg has confirmed the V30’s unveiling at IFA on August 31.  iPhone\xa08  The iPhone 8 is rumored to cost a lot, and we mean a lot. So what do you get for that type of price is very overwhelming.

As expected, there will be no headphone jack. And rumors say that even though the phone will be physically smaller than the 7Plus, the battery life is expected to improve. There is a cutout at the top of the screen for all the sensors and cameras. We are yet to see how that is going to work, including the placement of the Touch ID.  The iPhone 8 is expected to launch later than expected, i.e.\xa0delayed.  Nokia 8  Nokia 8 is the long rumored flagship phone from Nokia expected to release soon.

['Your 4G Enabled Smartphone can be HIJACKED and hackers can pretend to be you!'],['Telecom'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 29, 2017']",2017-07-29 10:55:04+00:00,"[""Using your smartphone for bank transactions, e-mails, messages, phone calls and web searches have become quite normal and essential for us these days, don’t you think so? Some of you might even be going through this article via your smartphone. Your number might also be linked to so many services offered online. We all receive messages on our phones from different organizations and service providers seeking our attention, advertising their products and programs. Imagine what could happen if all the contacts saved on your smartphone received messages from your number asking for money or any other help, without your knowledge… Imagine your bank account/s getting emptied because the authentication was approved from your phone but not by you…  Imagine hackers pretending to be you and using your smartphone as if it’s their own. A bit scary, isn’t it?  China’s leading security company- 360 Technology has been working closely with the Unicorn Team researchers regarding this very issue adn have come up with a name for this: “Ghost Telephonist”. They discovered that they could hack phones when they switched from modern LTE wireless networks (4G) to older, slower 2G technology. Our phones do this all the time when the signal is weak, although we may not have noticed when it happens. Usually, a phone is required to send authentication codes when connecting to any network to prove its identity as the device that houses your number. However, when a phone switches from a 4G LTE network to a lower 2G network, this authentication is not required. At the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Thursday, the team revealed that this gives hackers a window to get the victim’s phone number and make calls, send messages, gain access to online accounts and more through their own handsets. This Ghost Telephonist attack can be executed in a span of 60 seconds.        How is it possible in a matter of mere seconds, you ask? The hack works this way because when our phones switch between the available network technologies, they always rush to keep a connection running and stable. In this very process, the authentication step is kipped entirely and hence creating a window for the hackers, said Lin Huang, one of the researchers on the team.  There is more to this.  The scariest thing that has been put forward by the researchers is that, if a hacker successfully takes over our phone number, we may never notice it. After taking over our phone number, hackers could use it on their own devices to gain access to our online accounts and all other linked resources.  At the Black Hat security conference, the security research team presented a scenario where they requested to reset a password by phone on Facebook. Facebook automatically sent a text message to the phone number which had been hijacked by the Unicorn team and intercepted the text on their clone of the user’s number and \xa0took over the social network account.  The Unicorn team is presenting its findings and informing all concerned network providers about the vulnerability and depth of the situation so that they can work on the authentication issue while the networks switch from 4G to 2G. The team has recommended modification of the authentication process or switching over to more secure technologies.  According to what Huang said, currently, the only way to block Ghost Telephonist is to switch your phone to Airplane mode. “If you are in airplane mode, that means your phone already told the network, ‘I’m offline,'” she said.""]",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ZTE-Blade-A2-Plus-Fingerprint.jpg']

['Study: Playing Video Games at Work Reduces Stress'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 28, 2017']",2017-07-28 10:02:30+00:00,"['Our day to day life is jam-packed with the things we like to do and things we don’t really enjoy. Undoubtedly, amidst all this, stress becomes a major part of our everyday life. Students, office-goers, parents and everyone can become a victim of this.  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there is a beneficial side to stress as it helps us develop the skills that we need to manage potentially threatening situations. However, no one can deny the\xa0potentially serious health consequences of stress. When prolonged or severe enough, stress can make an individual feel overwhelmed and out of control. There are many victims of stress all across the globe. Some of them even suffering from serious psychological distress severe enough to require medical treatment. To add to the fright, those who are the most affected, often can’t afford general medical treatment.  Researches and studies are constantly being carried out to understand the depth of the circumstances surrounding stress and it’s hazards. A new research carried out on office-goers to study what causes them stress and what can be done to relieve them of it, a new finding has been brought to light. The antidote had been with us all along: video games! yes, video games!        According to the new report, published by the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, more than half of Americans regularly experience cognitive fatigue related to stress, frustration and anxiety while at work. This research also found out that, those individuals who work in safety-related critical fields—such as health care and air-traffic control—are at an even greater risk of cognitive fatigue, which could lead to many errors and hazards at work.  Certainly, there have been studies that have linked playing video games to violence and other problems including addiction, obesity, social isolation, postural defects. However, counter studies to prove that video games are not fatal were being carried out religiously. In that context, this study has come forward claiming that playing video games at work will help to relieve stress.  Michael Rupp, a doctoral student in human factors and cognitive psychology at the University of Central Florida, and the co-authors of this study, decided to evaluate whether casual video game play during rest breaks is an effective way to combat workplace stress. in order to do this, they\xa0used a computer-based tasked to induce cognitive fatigue to 66 participants. They were then given a 5-minute break. The rest break was utilized to make the participants play a video game called Sushi Cat, perform a guided relaxation activity or sit quietly in the testing room without a phone or a computer.  Throughout the experiment, the researchers measured the participants’ stress level, mood and cognitive performance. They found that only those who played the video game reported that they felt better after the break. Those who took a silent rest break felt they were less engaged with work and experienced worry. And those who were in the guided relaxation break saw reductions in negative affect and distress.  Now, to quote Michael Rupp:  “We often try to power through the day to get more work finished, which might not be as effective as taking some time to detach for a few minutes. People should plan short breaks to make time for an engaging and enjoyable activity,\xa0such as video games, that can help them recharge.”  So, what are you waiting for?

['Leagoo M8 Review: A 5.7-inch Phablet on a Budget'],"['Leagoo', 'Reviews']",['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['July 26, 2017']",2017-07-26 12:00:48+00:00,"['Leagoo\xa0smartphones were  introduced in Nepal \xa0last year.\xa0The Leagoo M8 is one of the mid-range phones from the company and is priced at Rs. 15,499. The USP of the device is its bigger 5.7″ display, a huge 3500mAh battery with fast charging, and a fingerprint sensor. With so many phones in a budget segment, can the Leagoo M8 compete? We review to find out.  Leagoo M8 Specs Highlights:\xa0   5.7-inch, HD(1280\xa0x 720 pixels) IPS Display, 2.5D Arc  Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Freeme OS6.0 on top  Quad-core MediaTek 32bit MT6580 with Mali-400 MP2 GPU  2GB of RAM  13MP rear camera, dual flash  8MP front-facing camera  Dual SIM dual standby  16GB of internal storage  MicroSD card support (up to\xa0128GB)  3500mAh battery  Rear-mounted fingerprint sensor  Color:\xa0Titanium Grey, Galaxy white, Champagne Gold  Price Rs. 15,499   Design  Visually, the Leagoo M8 looks almost similar to its M series\xa0siblings.\xa0It is, however, the biggest of the bunch and trades in the  capacitive buttons  for on screen navigation bar. The phone is enclosed in a  metallic frame  with a  plastic back , just like on the 2016\xa0Samsung J series phones. The front of the phone is quite similar to most of the budget phones, although overall the phone felt quite cheap in hand including the metallic frame.         There is a USB port on the bottom, headphone jack on the top, both volume keys and power button on the right side and an empty left side. The front houses a display along with the front cameras and the sensors.   The back of the phone has a small bump for the camera and fingerprint sensor. The buttons on the sides also failed to give enough satisfying feedback. Overall, the phone  looks reasonably well  but the  build quality is average .  Display  The device has a huge  5.7-inch 720p HD IPS  display. If you love big screens, the M8 has one. Even the phone’s motto\xa0of the phone is “Huge View” hinting to its screen real-estate. The IPS technology delivers very good colors and wide viewing angles. The resolution is where the display disappointment. With a 1280*720 resolution on a huge 5.7-inch screen, it’s not quite as sharp as you would like it to be. The display is bright enough for cloudy outdoors but on bright days, you might have problems.   Performance  The M8 runs on an outdated 32-bit Cortex A7 Quad-core MediaTek MT6580 with Mali-400 MP2 GPU. The phone  performs OK  for what I experienced. With 2 GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, the phone is fine for basic use. However, with a few lags here and there, it will be enough for basic use for an average user.        1  of 5                                                                    Although gaming on the Leagoo M8 was a huge surprise. I expected games to be laggy and unplayable but it ran games like temple run 2 and clash royal all the way up to even Leo’s fortune. That might be due to the lower resolution screen, but the main thing is the M8 is capable of\xa0 running most average games smoothly .  Software  The software is one of the  biggest downsides  of the phone. The phone runs on  Android 6.0 \xa0Marshmallow with  Freeme OS  on top. If you have used any Android phones from a Chinese manufacturer, it looks and feels exactly the same if not worst. There is very less optimization of any sorts and that affects the performance, battery life, and your daily usage.        1  of 9                                                                                                            You do get a few things here and there, like using the fingerprint sensor to navigate through the phone, a built in  screen recorder , dual tag ( multi account on apps  like FB, Viber, Whatsapp),  theme club , and even their own app store.  I also don’t expect the phone to get the Nougat update or any other types of updates. You won’t find any custom ROMs for Leagoo phones either. Although for any average person this won’t be much of an issue.  Connectivity  Connectivity wise, the Leagoo M8 comes with a  Dual Sim support  with a separate\xa0 MicroSD card slot . However, there is  no 4G  support. Other things include standard connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,\xa0compass, GPS and Proximity sensor.        1  of 2                                      Battery  There is a  3500mAh battery  which might sound like a lot but as mentioned earlier the Leagoo M8 suffers from very  bad software optimizations . You can get about  3-4 hours  of screen on time which is about decent for a phone of this price. Although with a huge battery and fairly lower pixeled screen, I expected a lot more (maybe 6-7 hours of SOT). You do get options like power saver (Ultra power saving mode on Samsung phones) and battery saver (basically limits the phone’s performance). It takes about 2 hours from the default charger that you get in the box to get to a 100%.   Camera  The camera on the Leagoo M8 is a  13MP \xa0 on the back  and  8MP on the front . Both the cameras are about as good as they get for this price. The front camera takes  decent selfies  for social uploads. The back also takes decent photos with up to 1080p video recording. You do get a few  camera modes  along with an option to take pictures using your fingerprint sensor which was nice in case you needed to take a selfie. Under good lighting, it is capable of producing some good photos.        1  of 3                                                Verdict  If you are on a budget and want a phone that will get you through the day, the Leagoo M8 is the one for you. Don’t expect the best feeling in hand or a light and well-built phone but do keep in mind that it provides decent specs, cameras and even a finger print sensor for this price.   What I liked about the phone   A fingerprint sensor at this price  Decent performance and a few built in software features like fingerprint navigation, dual tag, and built-in screen recorder  Price to performance ratio  Inclusion of fast charge  Inclusion of a clear case in the box   What I disliked about the phone   The cheap feeling, built and weight of the phone  Lack of software optimization and lack of 4G  Even though the 4 hour on screen time is average, the phone huge battery paired with the low-resolution screen should have provided a more decent battery life  UI of the phone feels cheap   Alternatives to the Leagoo M8  Xiaomi Redmi 4A  The phone priced at Rs. 14,999 sports a 5-inch HD IPS LCD display and powered by a 1.4GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 425 processor with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 308 GPU. It runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box with MIUI8 on top. The\xa0device has a 13-megapixel rear facing camera\xa0with 5MP at the front. The good thing about this phone is that it has a big 3,120 mAh battery. You can check out our review of the\xa0 Redmi 4A here .  Nokia 3  Nokia 3 \xa0is the low-end Android-powered released recently in Nepal. At the front, the device sports a 5-inch display which ends in a 2.5D glass arc.

['Sony Xperia XZs launched in Nepal: Pre-booking started'],"['Sony', 'Sony Xperia']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['July 26, 2017']",2017-07-26 05:48:16+00:00,"['Sony Xperia XZs , which was announced at MWC 2017 back in February, is making an entrance in Nepal. It is the successor of Sony’s last year flagship Xperia XZ and closely resembles the predecessor in specs and design. Tagged with the price of Rs. 69,000, Sony has started taking pre-orders for the phone. Though valued with a hefty price tag, Sony has tried to lure its potential buyers offering a free power bank (whose capacity is yet veiled).  Sony XZs overview  Sony XZs comes with a 5.2-inch Full-HD display with Gorilla Glass protection. The pixel density of 424 PPI on the phone does not seem that disappointing, but the thick bezels on the top and the button could be the turn off factor for the most. The phone is powered by last year’s flagship chipset Snapdragon 820 backed by Adreno 530 GPU.         The ultimate selling point on the phone is the camera. The device boasts a 19MP sensor, which is a demotion in the Megapixel count as compared to its predecessor. But since the Megapixel count does not depict the quality of the images, the camera on XZs is not an absolute downgrade but an upgrade with increased pixel size and more importantly the capability of taking slow-motion videos at 960 fps. Xperia XZs is also capable of shooting 4k videos. The rear camera on the device is also favored with Predictive Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus. On the front, there is a 13MP sensor for taking selfies. The front shooter has a wide aperture of f/2.0, which is capable of letting the greater amount of light and aids to take sharp, clear and noiseless shots even in low lights.  On the storage side, the Xperia XZs enjoys 64GB of internal storage and 4GB of RAM. The internal storage can be expanded up to 256GB via SDcard. The device comes with Android Nougat with light UI on the top giving glimpses of the stock Android. Sony XZs is fueled by mediocre 2900mAh non-removable battery though promised with Quick Charge 3.0.  Sony XZs Specifications in a nutshell   Dimension: 146 x 72 x 8.1 mm, Weight: 161g  5.2-inch IPS LCD Full-HD display with Gorilla Glass protection  Rear Camera: 19MP with f/2.0, EIS, Predictive Phase Detection and Laser Auto Focus, LED Flash  Front camera: 13MP with f/2.0  Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset  Quad-core (2×2.15 GHz & 2×1.6 GHz) processor  Adreno 530 GPU  Android v7.1 Nougat  4GB of RAM  Internal Storage: 64GB  Expandable Storage: Up to 256GB  IP68 certified (water and dust resistant)  Sensors: Fingerprint, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, barometer, compass, color spectrum  USB Type-C connector  2900mAh Non-removable battery with fast charging (Quick Charge 3.0) capability   Sony Xperia XZS Price in Nepal: 69,000    Verdict on Sony XZs  Sony smartphones launch in Nepal in a languid pace after months of their launch in the international market. And Sony XZs is not an exception. Sony used to have a good market share in Nepal once. However, they are losing their grip now. The probable reason could be the late launches of the phones. And given the price and specs, the smartphones brought are unable to compete in the market since Chinese smartphones are prevailing offering a greater value for money. This\xa0reason has caused sales drought of Sony products in the recent years. And the ultimate answer to sales drought is the price drop. Looking at the history, Sony Xperia XA would be the perfect example. Sony Xperia XA, which was  launched for Rs. 34,500  is now available for  Rs. 18,000 . So if you have liked the phone and willing to buy then\xa0anticipation can save you some bucks.  Before buying this smartphone, the striking question would be ‘is the phone really worth the price?’ There are smartphones in the similar price bracket that supersede Sony XZs in every possible aspect except for the 960 fps frame rate, which is only available on shooting 720p videos. So just for the slow motion videos at 960 fps frame rate, does the phone deserves all the money? I will leave it to answer on your own. In addition to all the grudges, Sony smartphones are not easily available for purchase as they lack proper penetration with a limited number of retailers. And finding the Sony service centers is another gruesome exercise. So if you are having a second thought on buying the smartphone, here are few alternatives.

Apart from that, it also includes discounted phone bills, starting at as low as Rs 153 per month. For that, you get unlimited data, voice, and SMS which is a very good offer, if not the best.         The phone itself is 4G enabled including support for 4G VoLTE support which isn’t a common feature found on basic phones. It also comes packed with apps like JioCinema, JioTV, and JioMusic.

['Chitooo: An app that gets you deals with Facebook status update'],"['Android', 'Apps', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['July 23, 2017']",2017-07-23 14:24:21+00:00,"['As of late, you have probably came across a lot of apps created by Nepali app developers. Ranging from games to utilities, these apps help us in many ways possible. Whilst some of the apps provide little to no functionalities, others really stand out from the rest. And the app I am reviewing today falls under the latter category.  A couple of days ago I came across a post regarding a new app called ‘Chitooo’. With my blogger senses tingling, I read what the app was about, and I have to say that I was impressed in an instant. The concept of the app is something I have never heard of. It works with a simple formula: users update their Facebook status via the app and gain several points. These points can later be redeemed for getting discounts or grabbing deals.  How to garner points in the app?  Like I mentioned before, users can collect points by sharing a status, picture or post a check-in from the app itself. Before doing so, they will have to log into Chitooo from their Facebook account. One thing users have to keep in mind is that the app’s name surfaces on the status on Facebook.        You can score 10 points if you update a status, 5 points if your tag your friends in that status and 10 points if you can complement the status with a picture. Similarly, there is an addition of a whopping 40 points if you check-in at Chitooo’s partner stores.  How to redeem the points?  In the app, there is a tab named ‘Buy Deals’. Here you can go through the deals and discounts Chitooo’s partner stores, restaurants or hotels offer. With the points previously collected, users can buy coupons which can later be cashed in at the stores itself. It is as easy as that.  What is Chitooo? What is it trying to achieve?   Why not let an official from Chitooo answer this question? A couple of days back I got a chance to talk to him and this is what he said, “The startup was founded with the vision of making online marketing available for SMEs of all shapes and sizes in Nepal. Chitooo provides a simple platform, connecting the right user to the right stores or restaurants.”  “This startup aims to establish a favorable ecosystem for SMEs, lower the cost of acquiring new customers, and retain these customers”, he added.  Verdict  Chitooo is an app with an entirely new concept. The app performs well even though it is still in BETA. However, I had to face an issue where the app asked me to enable my GPS when it was already enabled. Also, there are a couple of bugs here and there.  What bothers me about this app is whether people will go through the fuss of opening it just to post something on their Facebook. Also, how will the app developers earn through this app?  As I mentioned before, Chitooo is still in BETA and the developers are still in a process of increasing their partner stores. Nonetheless, it is a go-to app if you want to get some discounts or deals easily.  Download Chitooo here']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/chitooo_GBN.jpg']

Although, we are sure there isn’t anything bad happening inside the company.         The bright side is, the company has been planning to launch the phone outside the US. But likely-ness of that happening is still a doubt following their new found reputation. They do however have a huge pile of cash in the bank ($300 million) so no need to panic. And the phone has also been approved by the FCC.  The creator himself has promised a lot for this device himself. Touting the phone’s unique design, camera, and modularity, he has even promised a stock android experience as well as monthly security updates with quote\xa0unmatched hardware experience unquote. We are yet to see if the phone delivers on all of these promises.  Spec wise the phone has a 5.7 inch LTPS IPS LCD touchscreen with a resolution of\xa01312 x 2560 pixels protected by Gorilla Glass 5.

The phone will compete with the likes of  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4  and  Samsung J7 Prime  in the sub Rs. 25,000 price bracket.  Huawei Y7 Prime Specs Breakdown:  Huawei Y7 Prime has a  5.5-inch IPS LCD  display, albeit the resolution is only HD. The competitors are offering higher resolution display in this price segment. The display also lacks gorilla glass protection, making it vulnerable to drops and scratches. Hence, sticking a tempered glass can be considered as a good idea. The battery capacity is of  4000mAh  which should last 2 days considering its lower res display.         Powering the Huawei Y7 Prime is a Qualcomm  Snapdragon 435  SoC with a 1.4Ghz octacore Cortex A53 cores built on the 28nm process. It is aided by an Adreno\xa0505 GPU which is a decent GPU compared to the ones on the MediaTek processor. In terms of memory, it has 3GB RAM and 32GB storage. You can expand the storage via a microSD card slot upto 128GB.   Optics wise, it has a  12MP shooter  with F/2.0 aperture lens, 1.25um pixels, PDAF, and single LED flash. The front houses an  8MP\xa0selfie  camera with beautiful Skin 3.0 mode. The company claims that with PDAF, it can capture photos in just 0.3 seconds.  There’s also a super fast  fingerprint sensor  on the back side that unlocks the phone in just 0.2 seconds. It’s currently running on  Android 7.0 Nougat  with EMUI 5.1 layered on top. Connectivity option include dual hybrid SIM (4G + 4G), WiFi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS. It, however, lacks Gyro sensor and fast charging support.   The Huawei Y7 Prime is now available from your nearest store in  3 color options : Gold, Silver, and Black. The company is also offering  free selfie stick  on the purchase of the phone.

If you want better excellent battery life and a high-res selfie camera, the Gionee A1 Lite might be a right phone for you.  However, battery life, fast fingerprint sensor and Nougat update are your priority, the Y7 Prime looks like an ideal choice. However, for me, as of now, the Galaxy J7 Prime ( after the price cut ) is an overall winner here with a good 1080P display, excellent rear camera, 14nm processor and good battery life.  Having said that, it’s just an early verdict.

['Has Machine Learning become a part of our life?'],['AI'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 18, 2017']",2017-07-18 10:35:03+00:00,"['Machines are the foremost workforce when it comes to performing a complex set of tasks, since they have better accuracy, minimum error, and feel less fatigue, unlike humans. For this reason, productions and fabrication companies employ robots for their day to day work. Experts estimate that machines are likely to overwhelm the world employment by 30 per cent within 2030s. Also, there are intelligent robots that use machine learning algorithms to replicate certain patterns. These robots inherit a given data\xa0and use those data to identify certain patterns to perform fast calculations. The machine learning mechanics is just like a neural network of our human brain where neurons manipulate and analyze the incoming streams of data.  As a matter of fact, there are also some systems based on machine learning techniques that can mimic the human mind. This so-called software can imitate behavioral patterns in humans. The software itself uses these patterns to perform certain tasks by implementing a fixed algorithm. These mimicking soft-bots focuses on writing software that can learn from its past experiences to\xa0improve its performance on a given task.  Recently, Google developed their  new artificial intelligence called Google’s DeepMind  that has manipulated itself to walk, crawl or jump through obstacles. Google’s DeepMind AI uses special algorithms that allow\xa0the computer program to learn from its past mistakes. This is a very complex type of machine learning introduced by Google’s engineers. We are still unsure about its field of use in the nearing future.        Machine learning has already become a part of your life, but you might not know yet. You’re likely to encounter these tools on Android devices to social networking sites and even on search engines. So,  What is Machine Learning?  Arguably, machine learning is not the same as Artificial Intelligence. It involves processes such as data mining and statistical analysis that mostly concerns on analyzing a collection of data. The programs arrange these data in a statistical order that allow certain patterns to emerge.  For an instance, you are watching a TV series where characters inside it speak languages that you can’t understand. But after watching it, you start no notice sudden patterns in their languages, or you can identify the modes of expression in their tones. Similarly, a machine learning system involves a large amount of database. The system then encounters a definite pattern and manipulates the data by providing a final outcome.  You might encounter machine learning software in some examples below:  Spotify  Spotify\xa0is an online Web Player, and uses basic machine learning to effectively scrutinize the choices of the music of a listener, and create playlists and suggests similar tracks. However, Spotify derives patterns from genre or other categories of music. Therefore, it is not exactly a typical example of machine learning. But apps like Deezer have a similar algorithm where the system inside the app will analyze the statistical data. These data comprises of the behavior of the listener like pitch, tempo, the length of music, or the songs that you play most often.  Websites like  Amazon  and  Netflix  also employ the same data learning routine. They recommend products according to a consumer’s choice or prescribe movies and TV series that you might want to watch.  Gmail  Gmail was the first product of machine learning after Google’s Search & Google Now. Google’s machine learning uses artificial neural networks to distinguish newsletters, social networking, and promotions. They also categorize emails and filter out spam by building a profile of the emails through the use of ‘report spam’ and ‘not spam’. The learning algorithm recognizes the contents of your emails and forms a pattern. These patterns will allow Gmail to instinctively mark off and filter out the contents we would see or we might not.  Facebook  Remember when you try to tag your friend on a  Facebook  photo and it identifies the individual and recommends that person for a tag. Facebook’s machine learning collects data over many tags and allows to spot the emerging patterns through which it identifies people in your pictures and recommends them for tagging. The patterns collected from the data might represent skin tone, contrast or width of the person’s nose.  In fact, some hospitals malls in Europe have developed a facial recognition algorithm in their CCTV cameras. Those cameras can identify VIP’s and celebrities who arrive for their preferred treatments. In addition, some shopping store offers their users free Wi-Fi and allows you to log in with Facebook or Twitter accounts that ultimately enables the deep learning algorithms on their Wi-Fi networks. These algorithms then suggest products that you prefer to buy.  Advertisement  Some adverts that are based on pay per click advertising platforms implement machine learning algorithms to get maximum clicks on their advertisement. The algorithms realize the position, color, and size of the ad. They can identify the position and ads on which they could get most clicks. This is why adverts get maximum profits.  Conclusion  Machine learning revolution has already provoked most of our lives. You might not recognize the direction for your house but your smartphone already does by navigating through GPS. These devices also maintain our social identity on Facebook, twitter, and Instagram.  Machine learning has affected our choices on entertainment and communication and most of our everyday tasks. It has transformed the conventional ways of business and trading. Finally, it also offers further possibilities in making our lives better by using machine learning in research and medicine.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/machine-learning-1.jpg']

['The hidden Internet. What is Dark Net?'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 17, 2017']",2017-07-17 18:02:15+00:00,"['There lies a hidden Internet below what we normally know as the ‘surface web’. The hidden net is actually inaccessible through ordinary browsers. Information\xa0on normal search engines like  Google ,  Bing ,  Dogpile ,  Yippy \xa0or any direct URL’s represent a fraction of the Internet. 95% of the addresses on the Internet lies beyond the grasp of any normal browsers or search engines. I found it frightening at first, but the Dark Net is really easy to access.  In this article, I will try to indulge you into some of the insight of the Dark Net. But first of all, let’s break the Internet into three categories:  Surface Web and Deep Web  Surface web as I’ve aforementioned is just a tiny part of the Internet. No doubt, people use this section to retrieve their daily news via social networking sites and any other information that is available on search engines. But the Deep Web, also known as the “invisible web” is a bit different than the surface web. Indexes via direct URL or Google, Safari, and so forth, are inaccessible in the deep web. Only some specified searches can fetch the hidden data inside the deep web. The Deep Web is at least 500 times larger than the surface web and it’s still growing.        Information on the Deep Web is inaccessible through normal browsing software that creates the search engines indexes. Deep Web uses alternative search engines and it is publicly accessible. The indexes inside the Deep Web mainly consist\xa0of databases, libraries and members-only websites. These databases will allow you to dive into a fortune of information.  Deep web manifests plenty of knowledge anything from academic articles and journals to medical directories, and much more. It also includes reports, statistics and other documents from all levels of the  U.S government . These sites have a better quality of information than any normal search engines would display.  The Dark Net  “DarkNet” or “dark web” is a small part of the Deep Web. Both the web servers and website developers of the dark web are entirely unknown. In fact, these websites are completely anonymous\xa0to the outside world. You can gain access to Dark Net through  Tor  or The Onion Router network.  Tor browser uses a network of computers or nodes which make the contents completely\xa0invisible. When users enter\xa0a certain URL, the Tor browser shares the data across a chain of similar network of computers. The browser dispenses the URL request and obscures the source and destination of the signal. This creates a maze of computers so that the URL on Tor browser is untraceable on the destination website. Because of this anonymity, many people use the dark net for illicit purposes. Drugs, weapons, and pornography are popular among the darknet users.  How to access into Dark Net?  The onion router breaks the direct link between the source and the destination computer. Therefore Tor browser is user-friendly for anonymous communication. Dark Net websites usually have an irregular address and composed of random strings of characters. Most of the websites on Dark Net have “.onion” at the end of their URL, for eg:  http://dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion/ . This site is inaccessible on normal browsers but it has a catalog of Dark Net websites that are available on Tor browser.\xa0 Facebook ‘s dark net has Tor address\xa0 facebookcorewwwi.onion .  Who uses the Dark Net?  Primarily, websites on the Dark Net does not involve illegal activities. US Military originally founded the hidden net. Military, government and law enforcements are the majority of the darknet users. Darknet mainly incorporates information databases for journalists, secret negotiations in political chat rooms, activists and revolutionaries websites, and other platforms. Journalists and political bloggers are popular among the darknet users, due to the strict policies in censorships of some nations.  DarkNet also involves instant messaging services as well as the Wikileaks portal where squealers can post any information namelessly. Since Dark Net offers secured online anonymity, terrorists and criminals advocate illegal and violent activities through darknet. Extremists can also organize their activities without disclosing their identity or location to the governments.  Dark Net and Cryptocurrencies.  Dark Net is the largest criminal marketplace in the world. Here you can buy anything from drugs, prostitutes, guns, ammunitions, and even assassinations or hit men. A recent police operation took down the infamous  Silk Road \xa0marketplace that had a business exchange of around $1.7 billion in a span of just two years.  Due to the advantages in the anonymous transaction for the  cryptocurrency, \xa0these illicit businesses are administered by using only Bitcoins. Namecoin and\xa0Safecoin\xa0are very popular among the darknet traders. These currencies allow you to buy or sell things and transfer money with minimum fees. They also offer privacy networks for other users to host websites and apps.  Advice to the beginners of Dark Net  The Dark Net is the Mob land of the Internet. Furthermore, the users have complete freedom of the information inside the darknet. Moreover, the data are encrypted which means the user is untraceable on the network. Everyone is anonymous therefore it largely attracts child sexual abuse networks and mostly dubious contents. If you decide to check out the contents inside the DarkNet, please be cautious.

Within January 2018, 1 lakh and 17 thousand Nepali will be provided with these biometric smart cards. This smart card will include the citizen’s personal information that exists in the present citizenship cards along with other biological information, collected and stored electronically.  As per the government’s annual policy, program and the budget, the National ID Center has set up a biometric card processing department that will be preparing all the necessary hardware and software supplies. At a meeting conducted among Government Officials in June 8, the design for the new bio-metric smart card had been approved.  Moreover, sensing the need for raising awareness about the significance of the biometric smart cards, the NID had been conducting consultations with the Election Commission of Nepal since September. They even put forward the idea for using these smart cards for voters’ registration or voter identity documents. The biometric smart cards will not only be the replacement of the citizenship cards, but also for distributing government services and social security benefits. These cards can also be used as an electronic authorization, cross-border security documentation and for the delivery of healthcare, welfare services, among others. All in all, these smart cards will help to provide prompt and quality service to the citizens at minimum cost, to maintain good governance and even to control crime in the society.        The Executive Director of National Identity Card Management Centre, Uddhav Prasad Timilsina has said that an online registration system will be made for registering the card. The Department of Passports is also said to be collaborating with NID Centre to add all the required information to the card. The polycarbonate cards, containing unique and random ID numbers, will contain 25 security features and will have unlimited validity. There’d be no initial charge for obtaining the card, but in case of loss or damage, the government is expected to charge around USD 3 which is the approximate manufacturing cost of one such card.

But unlike the Samsung Galaxy S8, Apple isn’t planning to put its Touch ID sensor on the back. According to a new patent received by Apple, the iPhone 8’s power button will house the Touch ID sensor.  If you are remembering Sony phones, then you are correct. This is the same patent that Sony sometime uses on its phones to house the fingerprint sensor on the power button. Sony’s first phone with a fingerprint on the power button – Xperia Z5 came out in Q4 of 2015. That would put it 8 months after the patent was filed.         Sony’s phones in the US\xa0come with their fingerprint sensors disabled. This reduces the chances of a patent dispute in the US for Apple also resulting in more chance for the company to implement this feature. And looking at Apple’s patent photos, the fingerprint technology could fit on an even smaller area. They could also probably put the power button on the top like its older counterparts but other positions are possible as well.  There is, however, a possibility that Apple will just keep this patent in its bags for now.

Specs wise, the OTTO Chekr is your typical bar phone some with decent features. The device has a 2.0-inch curved landscape display. It is powered by a MT6261D chipset. The Chekr has a 1500 mAh battery which will probably give you a couple of days of battery life even under heavy usage.

The changing lifestyle of people has resulted in an\xa0increase in the number of diabetes patients. And OTTO is playing its part by helping users check their sugar level in an instant through their mobile phone. To implement this technology, OTTO has paired up with Bioland technology to create something that has already been approved by USA’s Food and Drug Association.

When buying the mobile phone, customers get a separate box from Bioland Technology as well.

Users will have to basically follow three steps in order to check their blood glucose level. I got to test it myself and found it to be relatively easy to use. One test strip can only be used for a single time, however. So, there is a hassle of buying a few packets of the strip every now and then. But Jaima\xa0will be soon selling a small customized box consisting of 25 test strips.  To measure the glucose level, users must firstly prick their finger through the lancet, and place blood on the test strip. There is a port on the OTTO Chekr\xa0which can house the test strip. Right after placing a touch of blood, the mobile phone measures glucose level after a couple of seconds. This is a fairly straightforward process that doesn’t take a lot of time.  The Otto Chekr has an inbuilt\xa0K-Power sound amplifier for that crispy audio.  Another major feature of the device is a Pedometer.

The technology here still seems unripe as you cannot use the wireless charging on top of a metal surface, you’ll have to place the charging mat 2 inches high from the surface using a non-metallic stand as a caution.  Apart from Wireless Charging, the laptop comes with 12.3 inches(2880×1920) touch-enabled display. It is powered by Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor along with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. You also have 720p Windows Hello Ready Camera which will unlock the PC using your face. For peripherals, it comes with\xa0microSD card slot, two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, and a headphone jack.  Dell 7825 is definitely not the wireless future we’re hoping for but it’s the first step in the right direction. We can look forward to other laptops in the future which will be improving the wireless charging technology.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Dell-Wireless-Charging.png']
['High-tech beanie could allow humans to achieve telepathy in 10 years'],['AI'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 11, 2017']",2017-07-11 17:22:07+00:00,"['You may now become able to develop your very own psychic ability with the help of technology.\xa0Scientists and developers have come up with a high-tech beanie that will provide users with their very own psychic ability of telepathy.  Telepathy can be defined as psychic phenomena by which mind-to-mind communication can be made possible. Such type of mental communication includes sharing of ideas, thoughts, feelings, sensations and mental images.  It is not a new issue that technology has tried to barge into the human mind and day to day life. All scientific developments currently in progress are focused in making life easier than it was before. Undoubtedly, communication has come a long way since it’s beginning from the days of early human civilization. From sending smoke signals to beating drums, from painting on the walls to creating symbols, from developing alphabets to writing letters, from telephones to the present scenario, the world of communication has, indeed, come a long way. And as we all know, there is not really a definite end to the advancement of science and technology. Keeping this very theory in mind, scientists are working on this high-tech telepathic beanie which will allow communication via thought.        Openwater, a company founded by a former Facebook and Google executive- Dr Mary Lou Jepsen, is developing a device that can allow people to see inside their brains or bodies in great detail. This technology works via a piece of clothing such as ski-hat lined with LCDs – and, when illuminated with infrared, it can see into your body to look for things such as tumors and bleeding or clogged arteries. This San Francisco-based company has targeted to\xa0create\xa0a wearable to enable us to see the inner workings of the body and brain at high resolution. \xa0People at Openwater are focused on replacing the functionality of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) with a true wearable enabling constant monitoring by using novel opto-electronics. This new wearable technology will be applicable for: detection and treatment of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, internal bleeding, mental diseases, neuro-degenerative diseases, and beyond – for communication via thought.  This high-tech beanie will use an utterly unconventional approach that enables us to develop MRI technology by using the scattering of the body or the brain itself to focus infrared light on scanning the brain or body bit by bit. The ski-hat like beanie will be lined\xa0with flexible infrared-illuminated LCD’s that have pixels small enough to create reconstructive holographic images for what’s inside the body and brain and look for things such as tumors, bleeding or clogged arteries. There will also be body temperature detectors lined along with the LCD’s.  The beanie will allow systematic or selective scanning of the brain and the body. It’s basic design and architecture has been decided so that, it can be used in reverse, to write, to focus light to any area of interest in the body or brain (to irradiate tumors for example). We may also be able to upload/download and augment our memories, thoughts, and emotions with it.  To quote Dr. Jepsen, “One day, the technology could literally be a ‘thinking cap’. The ‘moonshot idea here is communication with the thought’ –\xa0to read and output one’s thoughts.” Though the primary focus of the beanie was to use it for medical purposes, within a time period of eight years, Openwater has targeted to make it assist telepathy.\xa0Dr. Jepsen told CNBC that the technology would speed up innovation – for example, filmmakers could potentially download their dreams and product designers could download their thoughts and send them to a 3-D printer. Now, that is something I’d really, really look forward to. Wouldn’t you?  A limited number of prototypes of these high-tech beanies are set to be released next year to early access partners. For now, let’s wait and see how this turns out.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/telepathy-via-bennie.jpg']

Whatever you’ve done, accomplished, or celebrated over your lifetime all sits in your Facebook Profile. So, this thought might have crossed your mind,  What will happen to your Facebook Account after you die?\xa0 Well, you can do one of two things, either assign a “Legacy Contact” or you can set it to delete upon request.  Setting up a  Legacy Contact  means handing over the access of your account to someone close to you or someone you can trust. A Legacy Contact can Pin post on your timeline, respond to Friend Requests, Update your Profile Picture but they won’t be able to Post as You or see your messages. So it’s a pretty legit way to take care of your account in your absence. Or if you don’t happen to trust anybody with your account then you can set your account to  Delete itself  upon request. Having two choices at hand, let’s see how to set up these up.         Go to  Account Settings  on your Facebook app and select  General . Select  Manage Account  which is on the very bottom of the window. Now Select  Legacy Contact  and from there you have two options. First is to choose a legacy contact and second is to set up your account for auto deletion upon request.   If you want a close one to handle your account, select Legacy Contact and from there, in the search box type the name of the friend you’d want to hand over the account access to. Then it’ll send the message to your friend letting them know they have been Legacy Contact for you.   If you want your Facebook Account to be Deleted after your demise, then you have to select the second option which is Account Deletion. From there, you can select “Yes, Delete After Death” and if someone reports to Facebook that you’ve passed away, it’ll Delete your account.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Facebook-Account-After-Death.png']

Usually, normal wallets are unsecured yet they\xa0carry our identity cards, credit cards, and paper currency. In case your wallet is misplaced or lost, you lose all your documents and your money. A chunk of currency may not be a problem but reissuing the documents inside your wallet is a real headache. What if your wallet never gets missing?  Previous smart wallets had Bluetooth tracker ranging within only 20 meters. But this new smart wallet arrives with a 512MB of RAM, built-in camera and a Wi-Fi hotspot.  Designers at Indiegogo, an International crowd funding website have created a powerful smart wallet named  Volterman \xa0that includes stunning features and an impressive design. It embraces every facet of a smartphone, except it does not have a display. The wallet comes with a built-in power bank that can charge your phone both wirelessly and with a cable. Besides, the wallet itself charges wirelessly by a leather charging pad. An external cable is available if your phone doesn’t support wireless charging. You can pair the wallet over a Bluetooth which notifies your phone through an app every time you leave the wallet behind. Also, the wallet acts as an alarm for your phone in case you leave the phone.        The new smart wallet has a 3G connectivity for Wi-Fi hotspots, a GPS system that can track your wallet in real-time and secure you from thieves or any losses. It uses RFID protection if any malicious person tries to scan your wallet. RFID blocker encases your credit cards inside a material. These interrupt and blocks the external radio waves\xa0since credit cards use RFID chips that use\xa0radio waves to read the information from a tag.  Above all, the most beguiling feature involved in the product is a 4MP built-in camera. Once you misplace your wallet and if anyone tries to steal it, the wallet will instinctively go into “lost mode”. The camera inside your wallet will capture a photo of anybody who will peek into your wallet and sends that picture to your phone. Though the camera is still optional and it is free of charge. The wallet comes in a cardholder, bi-fold or travel size and the power bank capacity ranges from 2000mAh to 5000mAh. The whole product is only 11mm thick and weighs less than 150grams.  The specs also include Bluetooth 5.0 which supports only the Galaxy S8.

['Leagoo M5 Plus Review: Solid Build on a Budget'],"['Leagoo', 'Reviews']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 10, 2017']",2017-07-10 08:15:09+00:00,"['In this competitive market, a new phone cannot make a solid impression on the people instantly. Especially in the budget sector where there is a solid hold on the market by companies such as  Samsung ,  Xiaomi ,  Oppo ,  Huawei , and  Gionee . Since our smartphone is the most important and the most fragile piece of technology we carry,  Leagoo \xa0a new smartphone company in Nepal is targeting its device\xa0in the  solid build\xa0 segment. The company has now released the successor to the Leagoo M5 which is the Leagoo M5 Plus. For a Price of Rs. 16,599 is it worth the price? Let’s find out in this full review.  Specs Overview:   Display: 5.5 inch IPS display with 1280*720 pixel and\xa02.5D curved glass  Processor: Quad-core 64 Bit MediaTek MT6735 1.3 GHz Soc with\xa0Mali-T720 GPU  Camera: Front Camera 5MP, Rear Camera 13 MP  RAM: 2GB  ROM: 16GB  OS: Android 6.0 Marshmallow\xa0with Freeme\xa0OS on top  Battery: Removable Li-polymer 2500mAh  Sensors: Accelerometer, Ambience, and Proximity, Fingerprint sensor  3.5mm audio jack  Dual SIM, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS  Color:\xa0 Champagne Gold,\xa0 Titanium Grey   Design   Visually, the Leagoo M5 Plus is similar in design to  Leagoo M5 . I really liked the 2.5D glass on top of the display. It feels very robust and premium when using the touch screen. Also, the phone is enclosed in a metallic frame that protects\xa0the internals from drops. Due to the presence of the metallic frame the phone feels luxurious in hand. There are thin bezels surrounding the screen which greatly enhances the front looks of the phone. Sadly, I didn’t like the plastic back cover of the phone. The back cover feels cheap and flimsy which gave me a plastic feel.         There is a slight camera hump on which the fingerprint sensor is also located but this problem is solved by the plastic cover which comes with the phone. The problem I faced while using the phone was with the lock button and the volume button. Bothof these buttons lacked the feel when pressed. Since the gap between the volume\xa0rocker and the lock is less than that of most phones, I frequently pressed the lock button when lowering the volume which irritated me a lot.  Display   When it comes to the\xa0display, I was really impressed with the 5.5 inch HD IPS screen. Like the  Leagoo M5 , the M5 Plus is a shock proof phone. The glass protecting the screen is designed to withstand a beating. We all have carried phones with a scattered screen at some point in our lives. Leagoo has made the front glass protection rigid\xa0enough to make it shatterproof. Coming back to the display, even though it only sports a 5.5 inch 1280*720p IPS screen, you won’t feel the need for the Full HD screen. The display is vivid and the color saturation is on point. Due to this, the display is bright enough for outdoor usage but in direct sunlight but you do get a glare on the screen. Likewise, for comfortable night-time usage, the backlight of the display can be set to the lowest setting.  Performance   Performance wise\xa0the M5 Plus gets a MediaTek MT6735 Soc which is clocked at 1.3Ghz. This chip is what I\xa0believe to be an entry level 4G enabled 64-bit processor. The processors have 4 cores and with the 2 GB of ram it comes with, it is fine for me for all basic smartphone usage. Also, the user experience with app switching is smooth but the problem is that the device doesn’t have a dedicated multitasking button which is a shame in this day and age. Instead, for multitasking, you have to keep pressing the home button and switch apps. There were slight lags while initially opening heavy apps like Snapchat and Facebook which is acceptable at this price range.      Benchmark   1  of 3               Geekbench Score         Geekbench Single-Core Score         Geekbench Multi-Core Score                     In terms of gaming, the phone backed by Mali-T720 GPU which is capable of smoothly running popular games like Subway Surfer, Mini Militia, and Gunship Battle without much drama on the thermal aspect. I was surprised to find out how cool the device was after hours of usage. Although, you do feel the warmth on the metallic area on the camera bump after heavy gaming. In terms of sound, this device is a pocket rocket. It gets the loudest mono speakers in the segment and you can really hear it. Though you don’t want to set the speaker to the loudest setting as the treble of the sound gets extremely amplified which is unpleasant to your ears.  Software   The Leagoo M5 Plus gets the now dated  Android  6.0 Marshmallow with Leagoo’s\xa0own Freeeme\xa0OS on top. Except for the dated OS, you do get a clean and simple UI which is easy to use. Like all Chinese smartphones, you don’t get the app drawer. On the other hand, you do get features like double-tap to wake up the device, off screen gestures and scrolling screenshots and non-touch operations. The options in the settings are neatly laid out which is much appreciated.      Software   1  of 8               M5 plus Home Screen         Inside App Folder         M5 plus News         M5 plus Theme App         M5 plus Files         M5 plus Info         M5 plus Launcher Settings         M5 plus Settings                                    Connectivity   The device sports a dual SIM slot which supports  4G LTE . This means it has dedicated dual SIM slots with separate microSD card slot expandable up to 128GB. The phone also gets a feature know as Turbo Download where apps that are only allowed to download through Wi-Fi only will be downloaded via WLAN and others from 3G/4G networks anyway. However, both Wi-Fi and Mobile data must be turned on for this to work. M5 Plus does come with a fingerprint scanner at the back which unlocks the device with a significant amount of lag. The scanner was many a time unable to recognize by fingerprint and asked for my pattern to unlock the device.  Camera   Leagoo M5 Plus sports a 13MP rear camera with f2.0 aperture. It takes decent pictures in well-lit condition and low light conditions. However, I didn’t like the quality of the videos it took at the 1280*720p resolution as it had a hard time focusing near objects. It also has a slight camera hump at the back where the rear camera LED flash and fingerprint are placed. Taking about the LED flash, the intensity of the flash is more than that of a notification light rather than that of a camera flash. The 5MP at the front takes average narrow-angled selfies. So taking group selfies with this camera is very difficult.      Camera Photos   1  of 5               M5 Plus Selfie         M5 Plus Normal Shot         M5 Plus HDR shot         M5 Plus Macro Shot         M5 Plus Panorama                            Battery  Battery wise, the Leagoo M5 Plus gets a removable 2500mAh\xa0 Li-polymer battery. The battery consumption is balanced out by the low powered quad core and the huge 5.5 inch HD IPS display. So, in my normal usage, it gets about 4 hours of screen on time which is decent for phones in this category. In term of charging the device back to 100%, it took me more than 2 hours with its standard 1A charger.      Battery   1  of 2               M5 Plus Screen on Time         M5 Plus Battery Usage                  Verdict   If you’re a person who is a little careless with your phone this might be the perfect phone for you. It can handle a lot of drops without any problem\xa0through. The phone has decent styling, performance, good display and a shock proof design. All in all it’s a good buy if you ask me.   What I like about the\xa0 Leagoo M5 Plus ?   Firstly, I really liked the solid build of the phone. Just to check, I dropped the phone a few times on rocky ground during the photo shoot of the phone. The drop just made a few scratches on the plastic back and the tempered glass.  Then comes the aluminum frame surrounding the phone that gives the Leagoo M5 Plus a premium feel.  The 5.5 inch HD IPS display of the Leagoo M5 Plus is a treat.   What I disliked about the Leagoo M5 Plus?   The mediocre MediaTek Quad Core processor seriously bottlenecks the performance of the device. I wish it has something more powerful.  The volume rocker and lock button are closer to each other. Due to this, when you are trying to lower volume of the device, the device locks up  Leagoo must implement a better fingerprint sensor. The one right now is not accurate and slow.   Here are some of the alternatives to the Leagoo M5 Plus to consider:  ZTE Blade S6  ZTE BladeS6 priced at Rs. 14,490, the ZTE Blade S6 sports a 5-inch HD display and has last year’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Chipset with Adreno 405 GPU with 2GB of RAM which is a great offering for the price. Backing up this device is a decent 2400mAh battery. Talking about the camera, it has 13MP Rear Camera with f/2.0 and up front it holds a 5MP camera with f/2.7 aperture. But bear in mind that this phone runs the dated Android 5.0.1 \xa0and has a 5-inch screen. Check out our review of the\xa0 ZTE Blade S6 here .

['Best Water Resistant Phones You can Buy in Nepal'],"['Guides', 'Buy Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['July 8, 2017']",2017-07-08 05:22:21+00:00,"['Gone are those days where your expensive smartphones\xa0get damaged by water. The new era of smartphones is made to withstand the usual calamities like drops, water, and dust. With Holi nearing in if you are thinking of capturing all those colorful moments without getting your phone damaged then consider looking at this list of best smartphones which are not only waterproof but also powerful.  What is IP68 Rating?  An IP (Ingress Protection) is an international standard that shows how much access protection your smartphone can provide. This rating has two digits, the first one indicates the protection against solid dust particles and the second digit indicates the level of protection against fresh water. Here’s a chart below which shows what these ratings actually mean:         Most of the waterproof phones have 6 rating on dust chart by default.   In water test, it is not that the phone passes through all the tests to get to level 8. But the smartphones are tested only for the specific level. For example, if we want to rate our smartphone as IP68, then it has to go only through “Immersion beyond 1m” test and nothing else.  Galaxy S8/S8 Plus:   Samsung Galaxy S8  is undoubtedly the most beautiful phone right now. With a high price tag and a lot of innovation going under the skin, the phone cannot certainly miss out its signature feature — the water resistance.\xa0Even with a compact form factor and infinity display, the Galaxy S8 has managed to incorporate IP68 water and dust resistance. Not to mention, the phone has a new 18.5:9 aspect ratio\xa0display, it’s a bit elongated panel and a lot of content don’t fit properly but it’s what all phones will have in the future. The display also happens to be one of the best displays in a\xa0smartphone right now. The phone also comes with one of the best smartphone cameras right now and has the edge over other flagship phones when it comes to low-light photography.  Read review of Galaxy S8 Here  S8 has taken a minimal approach for its UI and it’s not cluttered like the last gen Samsung phones. It is one of the handiest and most premium phones you can buy in Nepal right now. The price of Galaxy S8 and the S8 Plus is\xa0Rs. 88,900 and\xa0Rs.98,900 respectively.  Galaxy S7/S7 Edge:   Whenever someone asks for a waterproof phone,  Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge  is the first thing that comes to my mind. These phones are IP68 water and dust resistant and can be submerged up to 1.5 meters in water for 30mins. These phones have one of the best AMOLED display in a smartphone and not to mention that insane f/1.7 Camera which still is hard to beat for many flagship Android phones. The phone also comes with fast and wireless charging.  Read review of S7 Here  If you are looking for a complete Android phone minus the stock Android experience, it doesn’t get any better than this. Not only S7/Edge are solid water resistant phones, but one of the best phones that you can buy in Nepal. The S7 Edge is priced at Rs. 68,900 and the S7 is priced at Rs. 57,900.  iPhone 7/7Plus:   Expensive phone + No waterproof = No good!  iPhones for the longest time has been one of the most expensive phones for general consumers. Despite the high price, it lacked the prominent feature of water resistance, which many of its Android counterparts have been adopting for years.  iPhone 7/7Plus  has one of the fastest mobile processor, the A10 which simply flies through everything you throw at it.  Read more about iPhone 7 \xa0  The 7 Plus also has an insane dual camera setup with a telephoto lens which allows you to zoom in without losing the quality. Not only that, the dual camera of the 7Plus is one of the finest cameras in a smartphone. \xa0Finally, the iPhone 7/7Plus is IP67 water and dust resistance making them better than ever. The iPhone 7 pricing starts from Rs. 92,000 and 7 Plus from Rs. 1,13,000.  Sony Xperia XZ:  As far as water resistance on Android phone is concerned, Sony was among the first or the only ones to implement this feature starting with the Xperia Z back in 2013. At that time, it was a bragged feature that made them distinct but today it is an utmost necessity.  Xperia XZ  is one of the most premium Android phones you can buy in Nepal. The phone comes with 5.2-inch full HD display, SD 820, 23MP Camera, fast charging, USB C and more. Not only the phone is IP68 Water and Dust Resistant but the Sony’s solid industrial design makes it aesthetically beautiful. The Xperia XZ is priced at Rs. 75,000 in Nepal.  Sony Xperia M5 Dual:   Like mentioned earlier, Sony was the first to adopt the water resistance on their phone and it doesn’t stop just with their flagship phones. Priced at Rs. 33,200, the  Xperia M5 Dual  is a mid-range phone from Sony to have water resistance with an IP68 rating.  The phone comes with 5inch Full HD display with 441ppi, it is powered by Helio X10 SoC coupled with 3GB of RAM. Optics wise it comes with 21.5MP Rear Camera and 13MP Front Facing Camera. The M5 Dual is backed up by a\xa0Non-removable Li-Ion 2600 mAh battery. On the downside, the phone is two years old and runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop.  Blackview BV6000s:  And finally, if you want a phone that can not only withstand water but all the forces of Mother Nature then  Blackview BV6000s  is the phone you’ve been searching for. The phones back case is made up of dual molding frame and the sides are made up of metal. It also has highly padded rubbers on the edges of the phones which protects the phone from extreme drops.\xa0 This phone is made for the extreme environment thus the Dual Satellite Positioning system, Atmosphere Pressure Sensor and IP68 water and dust resistance.  Priced at Rs. 20,000, it features a 4.7-inch HD display with Gorilla Glass 3 protection, a quad-core processor, and 2GB RAM runs the show with power provided by a 4500mAh battery.

['What is Piezoelectricity and its possible application for smartphones in the future'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 6, 2017']",2017-07-06 07:40:58+00:00,"['A few days ago, Vivo smartphones teaming up with Qualcomm unveiled their  on-screen fingerprint sensor  that brings ultrasonic fingerprint scanning to mobile devices, also known as biometric authentication. The technology use Piezoelectricity that changes mechanical pressure or sound vibration to exchange ultrasonic signals which travel through its OLED screen and create a 3D map of your fingerprint under the screen. So, what exactly is Piezoelectricity (pronounced as pee-ay-jo) and what does it hold for future applications in mobile computing? Let’s take a brief look:  What is piezoelectricity?  Quartz crystals (Silicon dioxide, found in sand and most types of rock) are the most common minerals on Earth that produce electricity when pressure is applied to it. Under any stress or sound vibration, these quartz crystals develop an electric potential (voltage) across its sides. The voltage can drive current in an electric circuit. Conversely, when the crystals are subjected to an electric field they stretch or squeeze themselves by vibrating back and forth.         What causes piezoelectricity?  A Crystal is a scientific name for any solid whose atoms or molecules are arranged in a periodic or repeating structure (a 3D structure). This structure repeats endlessly on the same building block, also called a unit cell. In most non-piezoelectric crystalline materials, the atoms are arranged symmetrically around a center point unlike other crystals, which do not possess symmetric structure. These crystals are electrically neutral, which means the positive charges cancel out the negative charge. But if you squeeze or stretch these materials, the atoms get disarranged which produces a small amount of energy that needs to be released for the material to obtain its original shape (similar to compressing a spring). This small amount of electrical energy can be stored or drive an electric circuit. Also, when electricity is applied to such crystals, they tend to stretch or squeeze depending on the amount of voltage applied. More materials are piezoelectric then you might think, such as DNA, bone, and silk.  Applications of Piezoelectricity  Nearly all applications that require the measurement of dynamic pressure change uses piezoelectric materials because of its better contribution in the results than any other conventional sensors. Since piezoelectric sensors have a high-frequency response and a better signal conversion, they provide fast and accurate control over a long period of time. These sensors can be used in every small electronic gadget ranging from computer chips, microphones, record players and even quartz watches that keeps your time running precisely. Piezoelectric speakers support every application that efficiently produces sound from small electronic devices such as earbuds, musical greeting cards, sound producing toys etc. Voice recognition software also employ piezoelectric crystals that convert the sound vibration of your voice into electrical signals and vice-versa.  The most recent innovation that uses piezoelectricity is in the sports industry, like tennis. In order to provide more comfort and power while attempting a shot, players requested racquet manufacturers to reduce the shock vibrations through the player’s arm. Piezoelectric fibers were embedded around the racquet throat and a computer chip embedded in the handle such that, when the ball is hit the fibers bent and produce charge which is transmitted to the silicon chip through a circuit. These charges are amplified and sent back to the fibers out of phase in an attempt to reduce the vibration by canceling out the initial vibration produced when the ball was hit.   Wearable technologies that include fitness and activity wristband, monitors that observe distance, respiration, heart rate and even sleep patterns use piezoelectric sensors. The mechanical stress and vibrations of your body organs are converted into electrical signals and are transmitted via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or any other wireless signals into your smartphone apps. Wireless blood pressure cuffs that measure patient’s blood pressure through a phone app is also based on piezoelectric energy harvesting technique. Smart watches that can manage texts, calls, and emails, smart clothing devices that monitor body movement and other vital signs, smart eyeglasses that can record photos, videos and connect to the Internet, all these wearable devices will use piezoelectricity in the imminent future.  Also, researchers at China developed a new transparent material that is attached to a smartphone touch screen. This transparent material on the device generates electricity whenever the user taps onto in. The mechanical energy from these motions could be then converted to electrical energy. Scientists at Lanzhou University have invented a transparent silicon rubber known as PDMS. PDMS consist of thin wires (about 140times thinner than a human hair). This material is then laid on top of the smartphone screen. When the wires are bent (when touched on the screen), they generate electricity. The voltage generated can be stored in the phone’s batteries. Further, researchers at the UK have initiated a new startup company which uses a special type of energy- harvesting rubber forged out of piezoelectric material. The rubber is placed under the sole of your shoe and generates electrical energy from the force of your body weight to the ground. These rubbers can charge your electronic devices while walking down the street. So what’s next for piezoelectricity in the upcoming future?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/piezoelectric.png']

['ZTE Blade A2 Plus Review: All Day Power'],"['Reviews', 'ZTE']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['July 2, 2017']",2017-07-02 02:48:01+00:00,"['We see new mid-range phones ever so often and most of them come with similar pricing and specs so there isn’t much distinguishing factor between them. Some may come with bigger RAM, others with storage and some with sheer battery power. Today we’ve such phone from ZTE, the  ZTE Blade A2 Plus  which promises us with the best battery life possible. Let’s find out if the device delivers what it promises.   ZTE Blade A2 Plus: Specs Highlights   5.5-inch, full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) IPS LCD display  Android v6.0 Marshmallow with MiFavor UI on top  Octa-core MediaTek MT6750T with Mali T860 MP2 GPU  4GB of RAM  13 MP rear-facing camera, Dual tone LED Flash  8 MP front-facing camera  Hybrid Dual SIM tray  32 GB Internal Storage  MicroSD card support (up to 256GB, uses SIM2 slot)  5,000 mAh battery  Rear-mounted fingerprint sensor  Price: Rs. 23,900 (Free Laptop Bag worth Rs. 1200)\xa0  Buying Link:  ZTE A2 Plus   Battery \xa0         First let’s start off with the feature focus of the phone, which is its massive 5,000mAh battery which has added some heft to it. It’s tagline  “More Bigger Battery Larger Endurance”  surely justifies the real life durability as well. With normal use, I could easily squeeze two days of battery life and with heavy gaming and frequent use, it lasted me until the end of the day which is what I would generally expect from a battery of this size. The phone comes with a lot of power saving modes if you want to get more out of the massive battery.   Also, accompanying the phone is a \xa05V-1.5A charger which fills up the device within 2 hours 15 minutes give or take.  Build        1  of 5                                                                    Talking about the build of the device, the back comprises of metal finish and feels premium in the hand. The back also holds the fingerprint sensor and the camera parallelly. The top and bottom of the phone have a textured finish which goes well with its design. And on the front, the design feels uninspiring as it looks bland with nothing much going on. It has got capacitive navigation bar which is backlit. The lights turn ON when you press them but you can also always keep them ON. The phone is on the heavier side with 189 grams but feels sturdy nonetheless. And on the bottom, there are dual grills where one acts as a mic and another as the speaker.   Display   The A2 Plus comes with a 5.5 inch Full HD display and its colors are on the softer side. But you won’t notice that until you compare it with another device side by side. The colors of the display are tweakable with the use of \xa0MIRA VISION option included in the settings. Watching movies and playing games on this screen won’t disappoint you but make sure you keep your hands off the speaker grill as it can completely suppress the sound. The viewing angles of this display are excellent from multiple viewpoints. I like how the display gets really dim making it easier to use at night, also it gets bright enough to be seen in direct sunlight. The display is susceptible to fingerprint smudges so it can sometimes hinder your visibility in direct lights.  Performance   For performance, the A2 Plus has opted for MediaTek’s MT6750T octa-core chipset clocked at 1.5Ghz and comes with 4GB of RAM. The usual walkthrough in the device is smooth. The opening of basic apps are quick but the demanding apps surely take a lot of time. Titles like NOVA Legacy and Asphalt 8 are playable at low settings with low or no frame drops. Despite having a metal body, I could only feel a trivial amount of heat near the camera section while gaming for a longer period, this is definitely an attribute of having a low powered processor. And with 4GB of RAM, you can swiftly multitask between apps with ease. But the processor’s mediocrity is felt when you’re heavily multitasking with demanding apps.  Software        1  of 5                                                                    ZTE’s Mifavor UI is running on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow which is pretty dated. As these phones never get Android updates, it’s outdated software can be a letdown for many people. Like with most of the Chinese UI, there is no app drawer and everything is right on your home screen. The phone comes with plenty of bloatware which fortunately can be disabled. The usability is straightforward with very few features for the launcher. If you swipe up on the home screen it will provide you with options to change the accent color of the UI, icon shape, and swipe transitions. There isn’t much you can do from the default launcher so if you want more functionality, you should opt for a third party launcher.   Most of the functionality here has been directed towards its fingerprint sensor. It has a clickable fingerprint reader, so there’s a lot you can do with it. A single click will take a screenshot, double click will turn on the camera and a long press will turn on the flashlight, however, these actions cannot be modified. I found these features handy for my daily use.  But wait there’s more!  You can click pictures, answer your calls with a touch. \xa0Swipe down the fingerprint sensor for notification drawer, swipe up for recent apps and left or right swipe on the gallery will flip through images. I really didn’t use these features but they are there if you want to make use of it.  The phone provides options to hide SMS, photos, lock apps and so on. \xa0It also comes with its own health app called  S Life  which counts your steps and calories burned. It has  Family Mode  which by turning ON, you make the UI elements larger and easy to use. This feature is directed toward someone younger or older who finds using smartphone overwhelming. So overall, the phone has got minimal UI and features which will not intimidate you.  Camera   Jumping into the camera of the phone, the UI is basic and there aren’t a whole bunch of features to play around with. Literally, there’s just the filter menu to choose between the different color filters and nothing more as a standard option. The UI seems inspired from the days of KitKat.   At daylight, the primary 13MP Camera results in acceptable photos but the colors are warm and the details are not on point. And in low light, the camera suffers well with lag in viewfinder and inability to focus. The images in low light are dark and contain lots of grains.   The 8MP Front Facing Camera, however, results in well enough photos. \xa0At low light, the front camera uses the screen as a flash which enhances the photo to some extent.  Verdict  So, coming to the conclusion of the ZTE A2 Plus, the phone is really impressive when it comes to build and battery performance. If you want a decent smartphone with great battery life, then the ZTE Blade A2 Plus will suffice your need. But for the price, it feels comparatively deficient as there are better alternatives offering more for the same price.  Pros of ZTE Blade A2 Plus   Battery Life   As a battery oriented phone, it is essential to carry a substantial sized battery and also make sure it provides a justifiable standby time. With 5,000mAh battery and mediocre specs, the device easily makes it until the end of the day or next. Such backup comes handy especially if you’re someone who travels a lot and also not having to charge your device every now and then is a great relief.   Build Quality   Midrange phones are opting for metal bodies but substantially a lot of phones still lack this, so the ZTE Blade A2 has the\xa0edge when it comes to build quality. Although the phone is on the thicker side and is heavy due to the massive battery, it feels premium and has a solid build.   Usability/Fingerprint Gestures   Usually, phones with Chinese UI is hard to use with loads of feature crammed into every other corner of the UI. But the ZTE has taken a minimalist approach, you can take this as a lack of feature or you can just appreciate how easy it is to use the device. You can navigate with ease and sort how things work in a jiffy.  Also, the praiseworthy feature of the ZTE Blade A2 Plus is how well they have managed to make use of the fingerprint sensor. Out of the usual convention, the fingerprint sensor serves more than one purpose which comes really handy.  Cons of ZTE Blade A2 Plus   Camera   The first thing we look for in a new smartphone is its camera and the ZTE Blade A2 Plus’s Camera didn’t impress us that well. The Camera can be termed as average, as the images on the daylight are good with the slight lack of details and colors. Also, the lack of features in the camera UI has handicapped the users from getting creative with the camera.  The main issue here is when you open the camera UI in low-lighted conditions. The viewfinder lags a lot, leaving trails of objects as you struggle to maintain your focus on the subject.   Performance   After Camera, performance is the second thing people look for in a smartphone. The phone uses a mediocre\xa0MT6750T chipset which falls short when you push the device with heavy multitasking and extreme gaming. Opting for SnapDragon 625 would have been great for the performance.

Although, you should note that this phone is only capable of making calls for now.  Nonetheless, it’s remarkable even to have this type of technology. This prototype phone relies on a technique known as backscatter. Here, the device can reflect\xa0the radio waves to function. It means that it uses analog technology instead of digital, which they say consumes less power.  The phone doesn’t have the best reception but it still works and that’s the more important part  The same team from the University of Washington in Seattle have also developed the ‘ singing poster ‘ and ‘passive Wi-Fi system’. These two inventions also rely on the same technology. This technology was inspired from the hidden audio bugs used by the Soviet spies during the cold war.        At this stage of the development, the prototype has a range of only 15 meters and includes a touch sensitive number pad with a small LED display. With the development process in progress, they are sure to improve their product with more and better features. But don’t expect a touch screen to come anytime soon as that would require almost a hundred thousand times more power\xa0to operate.  Picture credit: University of Washington  For now, this phone functions just like a walkie-talkie, you have to press a button to switch between listening and speaking. But they have promised the call quality to improve and an E-ink display for text messages for their next generation.  But still, these quirks are worth the benefits we stand to achieve from this device. If you think of the most important device that you don’t want to die on you, that would be your phone, and this promises the same.  The developers have also promised to price this device at a very reasonable rate. But for now, we can hope that progress continues at a steady rate without hiccups.

['INTERLAND: Google’s Web Based Game For A Beautiful Purpose'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 1, 2017']",2017-07-01 11:42:25+00:00,"['Interland is a web-based game designed to aware the people about internet security. This game is specially designed for kids to warn them about phishing, internet harassment, internet security and other internet safety concerns. This game comes under Google’s “Be Internet Awesome” initiative to help children of today learn the fundamentals of digital citizenship.  Although this game is designed for kids, it is fun for adults too. I played this game for a few hours and found it to be interesting and fun. It is the product of countless inputs from\xa0educators, YouTube videographers, internet safety and literacy organizations. In terms of medicine, Interland feels like a syrup rather than a tablet for kids to swallow which is a good thing.  For playing the game, you just log-in to Interland\xa0and select one of 4 areas. They are King Kingdom, Reality River, Mindful Mountain and finally Tower of Treasure.        1. King Kingdom   This area\xa0makes us aware of the impact of cyber bullies. The beings in this game are called internauts. In this land the internauts are sad and we must share kindness to them in order to make them happy. We must also protect the fellow internauts from bullies. To complete all tasks, you have to either press a button to put a barrier between the sad internaut and the bully or simply report the bully using a microphone.  2. Reality River   Reality River enlightens us about the dangers of phishing. The goal of the game is to cross a\xa0river. To cross the river all you have to do is correctly choose the given option. Even if you choose a\xa0wrong option, don’t worry because you will get another try. The main initiative of the game is not to trick you to lo s e but to educate you about phishing. After answering all the questions correctly, you finally get to the river.  3. Mindful Mountain   The objective of Mindful Mountain is to teach us how information is to be shared. It teaches the players to share useful knowledge and discard sharing any junk information. Here you have to bounce light through mirrors to reflect information to the desired\xa0internauts.  4. Tower of Treasure   The Tower of Treasure is a password security game. The internaut has to run and collect letters in the form of blocks. They will also have to dodge\xa0obstacles using either the right, left control or jump key. It resembles a\xa0Temple Run-style endless game.  In a Nutshell  All in all, Interland is a wonderful way to teach kids about the dangers of the internet and precautions one must take while using the internet. Here in Nepal, this is also great for parents and grandparents who are not aware of all the harmful things on the internet. Have you guys tried this game? Have your parents or grandparents played this game? Let us know in the comments below!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Untitled-1-2.png']

['Gionee A1 Plus Review: Camera & Battery Focus!'],"['Gionee', 'Reviews']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['June 30, 2017']",2017-06-30 15:25:01+00:00,"['gWith ever evolving realm of smartphones, improvements on specs is a constant progression. Brands proclaim to have the best of a certain aspect, but, front camera and battery is something less heard of. Today we’ve got the new phone from  Gionee , the  Gionee A1 Plus  which promises us both; a super selfie camera and a durable battery life. Let’s find out if the Gionee A1 Plus delivers what it has pledged.   SPECIFICATIONS OF GIONEE A1 PLUS:   6.0 inches (1080 x 1920) @367ppi  Weight: 226 grams  Amigo OS 4.0 on top of Android 7.0 Nougat  MediaTek MT6757T Helio P25 Chipset  Octa-core (4×2.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4×1.4 GHz Cortex-A53) CPU  Mali-T880MP2 GPU  4GB RAM  64GB Internal Storage, Expandable up to 256GB  Dual 13 MP + 5 MP Rear Camera with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus  20MP Front Facing Camera with f/2.0 aperture  Non-removable Li-Ion 4550 mAh battery with fast charging   Build :         The Gionee A1 Plus comes with a metal clad body with a hefty weight of 226grams. It looks pleasantly beautiful despite the common industrial design aesthetics. With 6-inch of display, the phone has a huge footprint which has been contributed by its thick top and bottom bezels. The phone feels chunky on the hand and it is impossible for single-handed usage. I really wished the phone was a little less heavy and the bezels were small as this could have really helped in making the phone handier.   Display:  Gionee A1 Plus comes with a 6-inch Full HD display with 367ppi. The display is stunning with bright and vibrant colors. You have the option to change the color composition and set it to be Warm or Cool. Watching high-resolution content and gaming is a joy on this display. There’s no color shift even viewing the display from a different perspective. The display gets bright enough to comfortably use the device outdoors in direct sunlight.   Performance:  With a high price tag and all the other great specs, we expect the phone to come with a powerful chipset. But that’s not the story here! Powering the Gionee A1Plus is the MediaTek’s Octa-Core Helio P25 Processor, where 4 energy efficient cores are clocked at 1.4GHz and four performance cores are clocked at 2.5GHz.   Considering its flagship status, opting for the Helio X20 would have been a better alternative. Even with that, for the daily usage, this phone won’t disappoint you as it crunches through everything you throw at it. The opening of apps are quick, playing high-end games with good frame rate is feasible and any task that requires high performance can be done. Although with its metal construct, playing high-end games for long hours didn’t result in noticeable heating.  The phone comes with 4GB of RAM. Gionee seems to have imposed strict memory management on this phone as most of the recent apps running in the background are killed quite early. Power Management seems to be at play as keeping running apps in the background consumes power. This action guarantees the Super Battery that Gionee promised with the phone. At most, you can switch to and fro between 2-4 apps with ease for a brief period.  Software :  Chinese UI are assuredly cluttered, most of them come with OEM’s own set of apps. Amigo UI based on Android 7.0 Nougat on the Gionee A1 Plus is no different in that prospect. It comes with its own Play Store(GStore), wallpaper app (Mood Wallpaper), calendar, notes and a whole load of Google Apps. I found most of them fairly useless so I froze them right away. And yeah, there’s an inbuilt option to freeze unwanted app! It also has no app drawer so starting with your first boot, your home screen is pretty much full of apps.      A1 Plus UI    1  of 8               UI Update App         Desktop Setting         Gionee Weather App detail         Gionee Weather App         Home Screen         Launcher Menu         Settings         System Manager                                    Also, the quick toggles from the bottom are hard to get used to. Often, I’d just scroll the content on my display when summoning the toggles panel swiping up. Swiping down from the top will give you the notification panel. Diving inside Settings, there are few notable features like:   Edge Bar: quick access to your important apps by swiping left or right on the fingerprint scanner.  Eye Protection: cuts off blue light from the display by applying a yellow tint.  Suspend button: floating bubble for navigation actions and shrinking the display for a  one-handed mode.  Power Manager: Switch between power saving modes.   And Chinese UI wouldn’t be complete without a System Manager app. The one in this phone lets you clean up the cache, scan for virus, and control networking.   The fingerprint scanner on the Gionee A1Plus is blazingly fast. Compared with the OnePlus 3, it was a tad faster without exception. As the fingerprint sensor also acts as a home button, it has to be hard pressed instead of touch to function. I found it really troublesome and wished it was touch enabled instead of a hard press.  Hardware:  The phone houses capacitive navigation keys, where the centered home button acts as a fingerprint sensor. On its sides, back and recent buttons have a minimal dot indicator. These buttons can also be swapped.   On the right side, it holds volume buttons and power button with tactile feedback. The power button has a distinct orange tint making it easier to turn on the phone on low light. On the bottom, it has micro USB port and speakers. Gionee A1 Plus comes with Maxx Audio enabled, so the audio experience with its speaker and earphone is good.  Gionee A1 Plus comes with Maxx Audio enabled, so the audio experience with its speaker and earphone is good.  Camera :  Gionee market their phones as the Super Selfie phone and they are among few OEM’s that put effort into bringing forth a plausible selfie camera. Gionee A1 Plus houses a massive 20MP Camera on the front, which sounds superior compared to its primary 13+5MP Camera which doesn’t even sum up to 20! But the quality of photos has more to do with aperture, the size of the sensor and many aspects than just the megapixel count. So, putting the front camera to test, I had great results with it. The images were bright and natural, they contained plenty of sharpness and details to make them worthy of social media uploads.   At low light, the images look decent but they contain few grains and dark spots which the front flash fixes to an appreciable amount. The camera also comes with face beauty mode which I found ridiculous. It’ll revamp your face making it look unnatural. But despite that, looking at the camera’s output, the Gionee A1 Plus is worthy of the tag  Super Selfie .        1  of 2                                      Dual Camera is not a rare scene on smartphones anymore. They serve different purpose ranging from wide angle shots, digital zoom and bokeh effect. The Dual Primary Camera (13MP+5MP) on the Gionee A1 Plus assists in taking images with Bokeh effect.   In general, photos have good dynamic range, colors are close to natural and the details are soft. The shutter speed is fast and the default setting gets you great results, so most of the time you can just pull out your phone, take the photo and walk away with a great result. Images at the low light are not that great with loads of grain and lack of sharpness.  For Bokeh photos, there’s portrait mode. You can adjust the aperture to maintain the level of depth on photos. The results were jumbled with the Portrait mode. With few photos, I had perfect bokeh on the subject where the subject’s outline was properly maintained and with others, the blur intruded the subject itself, going inside bounds. So, for the perfect photo, you might have to experiment with the portrait mode a few times.        1  of 6                                                                              The camera comes with a bunch of modes that will prove helpful. You have a dedicated professional mode which provides options to fine-tune shutter speed, White Balance, Exposure, and ISO. There’s also night mode, time-lapse, slow motion, GIF, card scanner and even translation. These features eliminate the need of third-party apps that provide similar functionality.  Connectivity:  For Connectivity, Gionee A1 Plus comes with dual nano-SIM tray with support for 4G LTE. It has standard connectivity options like WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC \xa0and has USB OTG support. The phone also has got IR Blaster which is accompanied by the Peel Remote app. Sensors-wise it has got a compass, Proximity,\xa0Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Magnetometer.  Battery:   Coming down to the second feature highlight of the phone, the Gionee A1 Plus comes with a befitting 4,550mAh battery. As we’ve mentioned earlier, the phone has been heavily optimized in terms of memory management and equipped with different power saving options to provide the best battery life possible. With regular use, the battery can last for two whole days. If you are a power user with constant engagement on the phone then it will provide 6 to 7 hours of screen on time. The phone comes with an 18W charger which charges the phone from 0 to 100% in little under 2hours.  Verdict :  Before looking into any aspects of the Gionee A1 Plus, first, you have to consider its size. Large phones are not for everyone, they are clunky and hard to manage. If you are cool with this aspect then you can begin to weigh in its pros and cons.  Pros of Gionee A1 Plus:\xa0   Big and Beautiful Display:    With a huge display, consuming content is more fun and interactive. Watching movies, and playing games is an absolute joy with this phone. Also, a large display provides you with options to get more creative. Editing videos, creating music and multitasking becomes seamlessly easy on a big display.   Amazing Camera:    With a bold tagline of Super Camera, Gionee has managed to deliver what it has promised. Both the rear and front camera are well capable of producing great results. For Selfie Lovers, this is the phone you can’t go wrong with! Also, the added functionality of the camera enables you to be more innovative with your photos.   Superb Battery Backup:    Carrying a huge phone basically, means sacrificing a proportionate amount of battery to your display. Gionee has managed to provide optimal battery backup with economic backlighting on its display, strict memory management and battery saving options. You can fully charge the device and forget about the battery for two whole days. Despite the durability of battery, the best part is how fast it gets juiced up. Even with heavy usage if you manage to drain your battery, you can fully back it up within 2 hours.   Audio and Fingerprint Sensor:    Inaccurate fingerprint sensors are annoying! You don’t want to repeatedly force your finger to unlock the device only to get a fingerprint error. That’s not the story with the Gionee A1 Plus, it has one of the fastest fingerprint sensors I’ve used and it has never failed to recognize my fingerprint.  The phone also comes with Maxx Audio enabled making the audio experience much better via both loudspeaker and earphones.  Cons of Gionee A1 Plus:\xa0   Chipset:   For what it’s priced at, a high-end chipset would have been more sensible. It’s not that the phone is slow or anything but a more powerful SoC would have been more pragmatic. With a similar price tag, the OnePlus 3 provides the higher end Snapdragon 820. Even opting for a MediaTek’s Helio X20 would have made it just that better.   Footprint and weight   The size of the phone is a personal preference and this might not be a con for everybody. But size plays a vital role as you’ll be using the device on daily basis. Usually, a handy and more manageable phone is better preferred.  With a large footprint, the phone is seemingly heavy. \xa0Samsung’s C9 Pro with similar size and configuration is almost 40grams lighter than the Gionee A1 Plus. Along with size, the weight of the phone also determines the ease of use on daily basis.  So, to sum it up, different smartphone excels at different aspects. The Gionee A1 Plus delivers what it has promised for, an awesome camera and durable battery backup. But you’re getting more than just that, it has an amazing display, swift fingerprint sensor, and a premium build. For those who love big displays, admire taking lots of photos and want a solid battery life,\xa0then the Gionee A1 Plus would be a great pick. But if you want something portable which would deliberately have better performance then you might have to look at other alternatives.

['Qualcomm announces in-screen fingerprint technology; Vivo Already has a working prototype'],[],['By Darwin Suwal -  '],"['June 29, 2017']",2017-06-29 12:38:02+00:00,"['The biggest drawback of the  Samsung Galaxy S8  was its fingerprint sensor placement. The technology to put the fingerprint sensor under the touch screen was just not possible by then. But now Qualcomm has officially announced the new  Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor \xa0that works through glass\xa0screens.  Qualcomm says the fingerprint sensor will work through surfaces like OLED displays, metal, and glass surface. We will start seeing devices with this technology from early 2018 and they claim it will be compatible\xa0with all Qualcomm\xa0devices as well as some other platforms.  Based on the  Piezoelectrical Effects , the Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor will also be able to detect your heart rate and blood flow making it more secure. And it works underwater as well. This new sensor can scan through an OLED panel that is of 1200 µm thick, metals of up to\xa0800 µm thick and front glass cover of up to 650 µm of thickness. This is huge step comparing that with traditional fingerprint scanners that can only scan up to\xa0400\xa0µm of thickness.        This tech works by sending ultrasonic sound waves through the finger’s skin, allowing it to capture a 3D image of the user’s fingerprint and unlock the device.  According to Qualcomm’s schedule, manufacturers should start receiving samples of this new technology from this month. Likewise, devices should start releasing with this new fingerprint from the first half of 2018.  With bezel-less\xa0trend on the hype these days, manufacturers like Samsung and LG will benefit greatly with the release of this new technology. And with the ability to detect your blood flow and heart rate, it will also be more secure. Remember the hackers who used the  photo of a man’s fingerprint to unlock their phone ? They are going to have a harder time cracking this one.  As the  leak suggested , Chinese brand Vivo already has a working prototype that was showcased at MWC Shanghai. The two companies,\xa0 Vivo  and  Qualcomm , worked together to make this possible.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensor.png']
['Is modern technology affecting the human brain?'],['AI'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['June 29, 2017']",2017-06-29 12:09:19+00:00,"['With a rate of constantly evolving and inflating digital technology, the world as we perceive has become more concise. We’ve arrived at a point where we can’t divorce oneself from the ever improving digital trends. Our brains are always under the influence of latest gadgets like smartphones, tablets, etc.). People can have real-life experience with the modern advancements in Virtual Reality, and the coolest games that are available now, and finally the Internet. Everyone, aging from children, teens to adults spend a considerable amount of time involving in these new digitized widgets. Since our brains are adaptive to the environment itself and go on developing, changing and, in some cases, eventually degrades with age, the surrounding environment plays a huge role in its development. After all, we are a species whose brain functions with response to external stimuli; or the environment.  In this modern era, where information is so cheap and easily accessible, we rely more on our smart devices and the Internet rather than thinking independently for ourselves. Children spend most of their time indoors with their devices which make them less attached to nature. Teens nowadays involve more in social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) comparative to having real conversations and social interactions. Google, Facebook, and Wiki are the top most visited sites in the world and there are about 3.5 billion users across the globe with internet access. Search engines like Google hold around 10-15 exabyte (an Exabyte equals 1million terabytes) of data which is a formidable amount of information impossible to be accessed in a single human lifespan.         So, is the modern technology altering our human identity? Let’s see what science has to say about these contradictions and how digital technology really affects our brains.  Researchers at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada involving around 700 people, carried out a study on human behavior and rate the results in the areas linked to perception, memory and brain function of their volunteers. These studies showed that the people who intend to use their smartphones most of their time in a single day were showing cognitive failures and low spatial reasoning. Also, researchers claimed that ‘these smartphones were making us less able to think for ourselves’ and also it made people lazier than ever. And on top that, they added, ‘Googling information we don’t know is replacing our natural curiosity’.  Another study shows how sat-nav (satellite navigation system a.k.a GPS) has helped a motorist on their journey but also, affected their memory as they remembered less about the journey and struggled to find their way out without the use of sat-nav. Similarly, relying exclusively on search engines led individuals to remember superficially about the information they obtained considering they could easily access that information later whenever they use these sites. Evan Risko, a professor of cognitive psychology refers this malfunctioning in the brain as ‘cognitive offloading’ or using these smart devices in order to save our memory power. Since smartphones are helpful to overturn our cognitive limits and save memory spaces in our brain, another study claimed that most of the museum goers carrying digital cameras often forgot the objects they remembered when they have captured apart from others. But what less can we do, it’s a tough task to turn around our head upside down to look into an object or scenery. A smartphone can easily capture that image, or imagine a quad copter that captures an entire 360degree spatial image. However, they couldn’t explain the long-term consequences of frequently offloading our reasoning in this hi-tech environment.   Although, it is true that these smart devices have made most of our lives so easier by assembling all the remainders, phonebooks and managing our identity in social media. World gaming industry growing day after day and the Internet, helping us to connect friends and families across the world and easing the tasks of many employees, workers, and even a laborer, but it does not eliminate our ability to interact with outside environment and maintain out interaction with nature itself. Given a certain time, we can memorize all those contacts saved in our Android or iPhones or do complex mathematical calculations or memorize any book with ease but instead, we use these devices as a means to free up memory spaces in our brains and use it for other important tasks. Our brains still function the same as our ancestors did centuries ago, though it is now adapting to a new information-rich modern environment. It is now up to us and how we use these technologies to create a better environment for ourselves and our future generations.

The device is simply a beefed-up variant of the regular Huawei GR5 2017 which has made its name for the dual cameras on its back.  Talking about the smartphone, the Huawei GR5 2017 Premium Edition comes only with two changes. Its Octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 655 processor is now coupled with 4 GB of RAM. In terms of storage, the device will now come with 64 GB of internal memory which can be expanded up to 128 GB via a microSD card.

The uplifted RAM in the Huawei GR5 2017 Premium Edition could indeed help in a better performance. It hasn’t been long until the regular version of the device received  Android v7.0 Nougat update . Since these are the same devices with the difference being bumped-up RAM and ROM, it will be upgradeable to the latest software Google offers.

The performance on the phone too is snappy with the decent Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 SoC and 3GB RAM combination. In addition, the phone takes good photos with a 13MP sensor on the rear. The rear camera, aided with autofocus has Dual-LED flash to evade the degradation of picture quality on the low lights. The front one too fails to disappoint by taking remarkable selfies. The front camera indifferent to the rear bears same megapixel count of 13MP with autofocus but with mono-LED flash.         The phone though has Quick Charge 3.0, which juices up the battery up to 60% just in 30 minutes, though, the battery capacity of 3100 mAh seems mediocre. Despite providing greater specs, the phone failed to add a fingerprint sensor, which the users find the most reliable means of security on the phone these days.  Remarkable display, snappy performance, and outstanding camera are the plus point on the phone. Also, the phone comes with the Android Nougat and promises timely updates on the software after the official release from Google. \xa0So, to sum it up, the phone seems a good buy for the price of Rs. 20,000 if you are good without a better battery backup and a fingerprint sensor.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/General-Mobile-GM-5-Plus-price-in-Nepal.jpg']

['Massive GoldenEye Ransomware Campaign Slams worldwide users'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['June 28, 2017']",2017-06-28 10:15:18+00:00,"['A major cyber attack has been causing huge disruption across the globe in many companies and governments. It has just been a little over a month since a malware: WannaCry affected thousands of devices around the world, but now a new threat from a new virus named the GoldenEye ransomware has come to light. Originally, this malware had been identified as Petya, that first started circulating in 2016. The current attack now appears to be a Petya offshoot with many added refinements such as stronger encryption.  Though the actual impact of the malware across the globe is yet to be measured, Bitdefender Labs has said that it has had its biggest impact on companies in Ukraine. According to Bitdefender Labs, Chernobyl’s radiation monitoring system, law firm DLA Piper, pharma company Merck, a number of banks, an airport, the Kiev metro, Danish shipping and energy company Maersk, British advertiser WPP and Russian oil firm Rosneft have been the targets so far. Many other companies in the US, Germany, Norway, Russia, Denmark and France are among those to have confirmed issues so far. Seeing this cycle of spread, The GoldenEye seems to be specifically targeting European countries. However, reports stating that the ransomware is all set to get through inroads and attack India is also being circulated. Bogdan Botezatu, a Bitdefender Labs researcher said on Wednesday that GoldenEye /Petya operators have already received 13 payments in almost two hours which is $3.5K USD ($3,500) worth in digital currency.  As we said earlier, it has not been long since we escaped from the attacks of WannaCry. More than 200,000 victims in 150 countries were infected by that software, making them unable to access their files. The malware had originated in the UK and Spain last month, before spreading globally. But it seems like the threat is even more serious than the last time. Cyber security experts have warned that this time the virus is much more dangerous as it has no ‘kill switch’ and is designed to spread rapidly though networks even without any human intervention. To add to the fright,as sources from MailOnline have reported, Marcus Hutchins, who prevented the previous WannaCry attack by discovering a way to stop it from infecting new computers, said that even if users pay the fee their files could now be lost forever. He further went on to add that the company that hosts the email account which the ransomware asks you to contact closes the account and thus, there won’t be any way to get the files back. However, he also adds that as it’s still early days, no one has been able to find a fix yet but researchers are now working together to make the malware decryptable.        One of the greatest concerns after the discovery of this ransomware is that GoldenEye relies on the same EternalBlue exploit as WannaCry. EternalBlue affects every version of Windows between Windows XP and Windows 10 that have not installed the latest security updates released by Microsoft.  Ransomwares are those malwares that hold data to ransom, scrambling it until a payment is made, usually requesting virtual currency Bitcoin because it cannot be traced to a user.  GoldenEye is not just another ransomware as it’s more thorough than them. Researchers from Bitdefender Labs have said that in addition to encrypting individual files and holding them for ransom, GoldenEye also encrypts NTFS (New Technology File System) structures and has a specialized routine that forcefully crashes the computer to trigger a reboot. And, for now, there’s no way to workaround it–if your device is affected by GoldenEye, you’ll either have to cough up the $300 ransom or bid farewell to that particular computer.  So, for now, let us see some ways to avoid ransomware attacks. Here’s a list of prevention measures compiled by Norton Antivirus:  1. Use reputable antivirus software and a firewall  2. Back up your computer often  3. Set up a popup blocker  4. Be cautious about clicking links inside emails or on suspicious websites  5. If you do receive a ransom note, disconnect from the Internet  6. Alert authorities']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ramsomeware.png']
['Gionee A1 Review: A Mixed Blessing'],"['Gionee', 'Reviews']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['June 28, 2017']",2017-06-28 04:12:07+00:00,"['In the price range beyond 30,000 in Nepal, we, the customers, want a phone that is primarily focused on the performance. But, the mobile companies are doing just the opposite. They are producing phones secondarily focused on the performance and primarily focused on something else. So, we take on  Gionee A1 , primarily focused on selfie and battery, to find out if it impresses us or rather disappoints considering its price tag of Rs. 30,000.  Gionee A1 Review After 2 Weeks:   Gionee A1 Review After 3 months:\xa0         Key Specs of Gionee A1:   5.5-inch (1920× 1080\xa0pixels) Full HD in-cell display with 2.5D curved\xa0glass  Gorilla Glass 3 on the front; Full Metal body on the back  1.8 GHz Octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor with Mali T860 GPU  4GB RAM, 64GB Internal memory, expandable memory up to 128GB with micro SD  Android 7.0\xa0(Nougat) with Amigo\xa0OS 3.5  Dual Hybrid SIM (4G + 4G)  13MP rear camera with LED flash, PDAF, f/2.0 aperture, 1/3.0+” sensor, 5P lens  16MP front-facing camera, f/2.0 aperture, 1/3.06″ sensor, 5P lens, selfie flash  Fingerprint sensor (embedded on the home button)  3.5mm audio jack,\xa0Waves MaxxAudio  Dimensions:\xa0154.5 x 76.5 x 8.5mm; Weight: 182g  4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS  Gyro Sensor  4010mAh\xa0battery\xa0with fast charging  Color Option: Black, Gold, and White   Design   Gionee A1 is a\xa0stylish looking metal-clad phone with a design that is not so distinctive from the crowd. Yes, we’ve seen a lot of metal phones lately but the premium metal used in the phone can be realized once the phone lands on the palm. The phone is a bit heavy at 183gm and\xa0is noticeably thicker at 8.3mm.\xa0Despite its bulkiness, the phone feels good on the hands with slight curves around its edges and back. But honestly, I found the phone to be a little slippery in my everyday use. The unit I reviewed was a black one but still, it attracts noticeable smudges and fingerprints on its back. However, the power button and volume rockers on the right edge aren’t as tactile as I prefer them to be.   All in all, the phone has a lovable design but had it had a lesser weight to it, it definitely would have been a well-designed phone in its price range.          Display  The phone’s 5.5inch Full HD in-cell technology display is arguably the best one in the price range. It produces nearly accurate colors and has a good level of contrast too. The brightness is sufficient enough for the outdoor usages. The best part is the option to switch white balance among cool, neutral and warm.   I fell in love with the display from the very first time I turned the phone on and after two weeks of using, the feeling is just the same. As far as the display protection is concerned, it has an\xa0unspecified version of Corning Gorilla Glass. At the time of review, the glass got more than quite a few scratches so my recommendation is to apply the display protection that comes with the phone itself.   Performance  Under the hood, Gionee A1 comes with an Octa-Core MediaTek Helio P10 processor, backed by\xa0Mali-T860MP2 GPU and coupled with 4GB of RAM. This configuration isn’t the best in the price range. However, a moderate user might find this configuration to be good enough giving a smooth and responsive user experience. But once you start pushing the device with a couple of games and few other apps in the background, you can feel the device’s sluggishness. While playing few heavy titles, we noticed the frame drops and the phone got noticeably warmer in our gaming sessions. More on the heating issue, the phone kept getting\xa0warmer not just while gaming and stretched\xa0camera sessions but also\xa0on several other occasions. However, in real world use, the app loading and app switching were buttery smooth.\xa0Lastly, the fingerprint sensor is satisfyingly fast and accurate.  Camera   Coming to the cameras, it has a circular 13Megapixel unit with SONY IMX 258 on the back that slightly perpetuates. This primary camera is accompanied with dual tone LED flash. The camera performance when tested on different lighting conditions gave satisfying results. The photos taken outdoors came out well detailed with a good amount of saturation. The low light photos did have some noise but the camera has a night mode that helped in boosting the ambiance on low light photos. The HDR mode works well and gets triggered when needed if\xa0set on Auto.      Gionee A1 Rear Camera Samples   1  of 7                                    HDR photo                                                      The camera app is a bit cluttered but supports different swiping gestures. Like, you can switch cameras by swiping from the bottom and swiping from the top reveals different camera modes like Time-lapse, slow motion, GIF, and others. You can switch between video, photo, face beauty, panorama and other camera modes by simply swiping from the left or right. For manual control, it has the Professional mode that lets you set shooting speed, exposure, ISO, White Balance and the focus on your own.  Since it’s a selfie-centric phone, it has a 16 MegaPixel front camera with f2.0 aperture. I made a decision based on selfies taken indoors, outdoors, with and without beautification and found out the phone to be pretty impressive for selfies. However, indoor selfies weren’t as detailed as the outdoor ones. And, I wish if the selfie unit came with autofocus instead of fixed focus. The phone also has a front firing flash that assisted a bit while taking photos in the night. But night selfies were a bit washed out and came with lesser details. For a beauty mode enthusiasts, this phone won’t disappoint. Plus, beautification can be enabled while taking videos and doing video calls.  Software      Gionee A1 UI Screenshots   1  of 10                                                                                                                      The Gionee A1 boots on Android 7.0 nougat with Gionee’s own custom UI “Amigo OS” on top of it. So, this UI is far from stock Android and has been heavily customized. If you haven’t used a Gionee phone before then you might find the UI confusing at times, just like I did. If you are against bloatware, you’ll hate to see a bunch of pre-installed apps on the phone including 4 games, ADW launcher, UC Browser,\xa0along with few others. Luckily, most of them can be uninstalled. Personally, I find Amigo OS to be a bit cluttered and far from my liking. For instance, the settings menu has been heavily rearranged and I had a hard time remembering which is where. So I preferred searching for the settings other than going through the setting menu and sub menus.  Since the software is based on Android Nougat, you get all the Nougat sweetness like the split screen mode, quick reply from notifications and grouping of notifications from the same app. Additionally, the A1 has an edge bar functionality that can be accessed by swiping on the fingerprint sensor and it allows to launch your favorite apps and tasks. In addition, the phone also supports different smart gestures as well.  Battery      Gionee A1 Battery Performance   1  of 2                                      The A1 houses a 4010mAh battery that sounds pretty heavy on paper but in real world use, the battery life wasn’t as expected. Yes, there were times I got up to 5hours of screen on time but that was on a moderate use with no or short gaming session. The screen on time in this phone was a mixed bag since the results differed each day ranging from 3.5 hours to 5 hours. However, the charging time was one of the best aspects of this phone. Started charging from a dead battery, I could easily get 23% and 98% of charge in 15minutes and 90 minutes of time respectively. To fully charge the phone, it took me 1hour and 47minutes to be exact. So the phone’s fast charging capabilities are worth mentioning. The phone gets warmer even while charging, though the company claims just the opposite.  Verdict      Gionee A1 Gallery   1  of 4                                                          To\xa0wind it up, there are a few points where Gionee A1 impressed us and at the same, there are few other where the phone disappoints.\xa0The phone’s display, camera, and fast charging\xa0capabilities did impress us but its performance, bulkiness and cluttered software seriously disappointed us.\xa0So, if you are a moderate user who’s after a phone with fast charging, good cameras, and great display then you can never go wrong buying a Gionee A1. But if it’s the phone’s performance that you prioritize the most then there are quite a few other options that you might be interested in.  I’ve some personal message to Gionee and that is, “Dear Gionee, please stop with your love for MediaTek chipsets.\xa0I am personally looking forward to seeing a Gionee phone powered by more Capable Snapdragon chipset. For instance, you could have used a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 instead of Helio P10 that sounds pretty neck-to-neck on paper but in real world use, SD625 wins over Helio P10 big time.”  If you weren’t impressed by the Gionee A1, here are some other options you can consider:  ONEPLUS 3 \xa0  If you already have a budget of 33K, the best is to add 10K more and buy the OnePlus 3 instead which will checkmark all the boxes for a phone with the  Snapdragon 820  performance worth the price.  Redmi Note 4  But if you’re tight on budget and don’t feel like adding\xa0money to your budget you can actually buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4SD instead and save some of your money. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4SD (4GB/64GB) is priced at 28,500 and has a much better performance with 14nm  Snapdragon 625  as compared to Gionee A1.  Cool 1 Dual \xa0  Coolpad’s Cool 1 dual is another phone to consider in the price range of around 30,000. This phone will easily address your needs if you prioritize on rear camera and gaming performance. Priced at Rs. 30,996, it comes with a dual 13MP rear camera and a powerful  Snapdragon 652  processor.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Gionee-A1.jpg']

Allied with the promotion of Loot 2 movie, Haku Run was a hit with above tens of thousands of downloads. With the avatars of Nepali movie artists and familiar periphery within the game environment, the game was fairly exciting. But will this newbie able to follow the footsteps of Haku Run? Can it be an optimum boredom killer in a smartphone? Let’s dig into it.  How to play Tap Tap turn?  Tap Tap Turn  game basically involves a rectangular box with four colors on its four sides. The primary task of the game is to pass the box through the colorful obstacles without letting the ball touch foot or ground. Death is inevitable in the game if the color of the front edge of the box mismatches with the color of the obstacle. For the gameplay, users are provided with two kinds of control, tapping on the left rotates the box in a clockwise direction allowing a switch in color and tapping on the right lets the ball leap evading the fall momentarily.  The game is currently available on Play Store and even available to play online. According to Sroth Code, launch on App Store is on due and will soon be released.

But to be true, the game does not bear a unique concept. \xa0The game seems inspired by the popular Color Switch game. However, the game is addictive. Since the install of the game on my phone, on every free time I get, I always opt to surpass my personal best. Though being a simple game, it is hard to get a good score. Frustrated from the frequent deaths, one always ends in scratching the forehead or pulling the hair in agony (well, that was in my case).  The game is free, so the users do not have to spend a dime to download and install the game. But at each death, ad pops up, which seems pretty annoying.  I wish the game had different modes to play on to adapt with the mood of the different users and their mood swings.  What do you feel about the game? Drop your opinion in the comment box.

Beforehand, Nexus devices used to provide the purest Android experience to its users. Google Pixel was a huge success despite having many drawbacks, starting off with its weird back panel with half glass and metal, no waterproofing and thick bezels up top and bottom. But it provided the best Android experience anyone could ask for, a great camera, swift performance, and regular security and version upgrades. The Pixel is already a year old and now it’s time for the  Pixel 2 .  We’ve been seeing renders and specification leaks about the Pixel 2 for a couple of weeks and recently a leaker from a reliable source of Android Police who claims to have used the new phone revealed the final specifications. Google was planning for three Pixel phones, one small, one medium sized and a larger one. The source claims that they revoked the middle one and only small (5-inch) and the bigger(6-inch) are in the making. So the Pixel and the Pixel XL for this year are codenamed walleye and teimen respectively.  The walleye  will feature a 4.97 Full HD display. There will be no headphone jack and in its place, it’ll incorporate\xa0stereo speakers. There isn’t much significant change in the aesthetics. The side bezels are a lot smaller but the top and bottom bezels remain almost similar. The phone will be powered by the latest Snapdragon 835 chipset coupled with 4GB of RAM and will come in 64 GB variant.        The taimen  will sport a 6-inch 2.5K OLED display. The aesthetics of the phone will be similar to the Pixel XL but the glass panel on the back will not coat the fingerprint sensor. Also, the bezels for the larger one will be similar to that of the walleye. It will also be powered by the latest Snapdragon 835 chipset with 4GB of RAM and will have 128GB storage.   \xa0  Both the phone will carry only a single camera despite the trend of the dual camera in smartphones. Although much details about the camera haven’t been revealed yet, we can expect it to surface in the coming weeks. Also, the bezel-less renders we’ve been seeing might not be what the new Pixels will look like.

After such interlude, we expected few innovative changes with the new iteration of the phone. But based on a recent event by Yota, it suggests not much has been changed about the phone despite the usual spec upgrade. For those unaware, Yotaphone is a Russian manufactured phone that comes with a secondary  Always On E-ink display  on the back and the usual primary display on the front.  The first Yotaphone was launched back in 2012 where the secondary display didn’t make much impact on the market. But now, at the time where people are thriving for innovation on their smartphone, this could be the perfect time for the launch of a new Yotaphone. The secondary energy efficient E-ink display is basically meant for notification and ebook reading but you can use it as a normal display for navigating and the opening of apps. As an e-ink display, it’s going to be incredibly slow if you intend to do anything except read e-books or check time and weather, as they have a very low refresh rate.         Talking about the hardware composition, Yotaphone 3 will come with a 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED display and a smaller 5.2-inch E-ink display on the back.

['Huawei P10 Plus Launched in Nepal'],['Huawei'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['June 23, 2017']",2017-06-23 15:13:49+00:00,"['With much anticipation , the\xa0new flagship from Huawei, the  Huawei P10 Plus  has finally been launched in Nepal. Huawei Nepal skipped the smaller version of the phone, the Huawei P10 as most people prefer bigger phones in their hand, also the larger variant has more features compared to the small one. Huawei P10 Plus comes in White, Black and Gold color with the price tag of  Rs.79,000 .\xa0We got a chance to play around with the phone for a while and here is our initial hands-on of the phone.   Design        Starting off with aesthetics, Huawei doesn’t seem to be innovative in this aspect. As most of the flagships have opted for a completely bezel-less design, here the P10 Plus houses the same industrial design inspired by the older  Huawei P9 , but only much sleeker and compact. \xa0        1  of 2                                      The phone comes with an unibody metal construct with a smooth or rugged finish on the back which goes seamless straight up to its curved sides. The phone is good on the hands and due to the smaller side bezels, it is somewhat usable with one hand.  Display        1  of 2                                      With the plus tag, the Huawei P10 Plus comes with 5.5inch Quad HD display protected with the latest Corning Gorilla Glass 5. \xa0The display in this environment seems really bright and vibrant. The fingerprint sensor has now shifted towards the front. The sensor is pretty swift for unlocking the device and can also take gestures as input replacing the navigation bar.\xa0  Software   Giving life to this device is the Huawei’s \xa0EMUI 5.1 on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. You get all the Huawei goodies like the knuckle gestures and customizations with themes and so on. You can now choose to have an app drawer or just leave all the apps on the home like usual. One notable feature of the new EMUI 5.1 was the side drawer when you swipe from the left (like Google Now). Here you can put your most used apps and widgets which seemed handy.\xa0  Hardware  In terms of storage, the Huawei P10 Plus has the smaller 4GB of RAM along with 64GB of internal storage as the higher variant with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage has been skipped. There is also an option for storage expandability via MicroSD card using the second SIM slot. Powering the device is the Huawei’s own in-house octa-core Kirin 960 chipset clocked at 2.4Ghz which provides performance equivalent to Snapdragon 820, so the performance of this device should be pretty impressive but not as good as the  Galaxy S8  or the  OnePlus 5 .\xa0  Camera   A dual camera has been a requisite feature in a smartphone. Huawei P10 Plus also comes with  dual camera setup  where the primary camera carries 12MP sensor and the secondary monochrome sensor carries a larger 20MP sensor for more depth and details. Dual camera is for the 2X optical zoom so you get better quality images even while zooming. It also assists in shooting with portrait mode. It is capable of shooting 4K at 30fps with optical image stabilization. \xa0For selfies, the phone carries an 8MP sensor with f/1.9 aperture. The event featured photos taken from Huawei P10 Plus by famous photographers  Kishor Kayastha  and  Anjil Maskey\xa0 which seemed pretty good. Due to a lot of artificial lighting, we could not tell how the camera actually is, so you have to stay tuned for the full review. \xa0Huawei P10 also comes with IR blaster which makes it easier for multimedia control.  Battery   Backing up this compact device is a modest 3750 mAh battery which Huawei claims to last for two days. In terms of battery life, we can’t say anything until we put it to the test. The Huawei P10 Plus also comes with Huawei’s supercharge charger which shouldn’t take more than 1 and a half hour to fully charge this battery.  Offers with Huawei P10 Plus:   Along with the hefty price tag, Huawei is providing good customer service with the device. Huawei P10 Plus will get  2 hours VIP Diamond Service  from Huawei Service Center, which means, if your new Huawei P10 Plus isn’t repaired within 2 hours, you’ll get a new device! You also get  accidental screen breakage insurance for 3 months . And you can get your Huawei P10 Plus delivered at your doorsteps. As a camera focused phone, Huawei Nepal will be giving  P10 Plus Camera Kit Lens  with every purchase of the phone. Huawei P10 Plus with ties with Ncell will provide  1GB of Free Mobile Data  for 10 months straight.   Initial Verdict:  So far we’re impressed with what we see, the built quality, design and all the other aspects seem pleasing but with competition getting fierce and with giants like Samsung with their  S8’s  in the market and  One Plus 5 \xa0launching soon in Nepal, does the Huawei P10 really has any chance with its competition?\xa0That’s the question we will answer in our full review!

However, most of the time, we ignore music\xa0output through its speaker and headphone jack. This could be a most important factor for the music lovers and audiophiles. We have listed Top Smartphones for Music Lovers and buyers that are trying to buy a smartphone that has a good Sound for listening to Music.  Before we move on to Top Smartphones\xa0in Nepal for Music Lovers, we’d like to make a disclaimer that a true audiophile might not be impressed with this list since the best smartphones for audiophiles are actually  LG V20, HTC 10, LG V10  and  ZTE Axon 7 . But LG V10 isn’t the one we’ll recommend since many units worldwide are having boot-loop issues. Unfortunately, none of these smartphones are officially available in Nepal. That’s why we couldn’t mention those phones in this list. Hence, the list below only includes smartphones that are officially available in Nepal.  Top Smartphones For Music Lovers in Nepal  Xperia Z5 Premium \xa0  Xperia Z series had always had one of the best camera and the speaker integration. And every year this integration keeps getting better and better. And, with the Xperia Z5 Premium with stereo front facing speakers, the sound is really amazing in this phone with the perfect punch of audio. It comes with DSEE HX technology that upscales low-resolution audio files to mid/high-resolution quality. With the inbuilt ClearAudio+ audio settings, there’s a wonderful warm bassline, and a precise, detailed audio character. Z5 shows its rhythmic powers with superb dynamics that rise and fall with the song’s peaks.\xa0Xperia Z5 Premium version is  priced at Rs.78,000 in Nepal .         iPhone 7Plus  iPhone 7Plus, the first iPhone with stereo speakers, has comparatively one of the best audio quality despite not supporting high-resolution audio files. The sound is pretty loud and gives you crisp and detailed audio with good bass punch and treble. Where it really marks its mark is when you listen to audio via earpods. Apple earpods have become really good and innovative and with the new earbuds and apples audio engine, the audio experience it provides is superiorly greater than any other phones. Check out the prices of the  latest iPhones here in this link .  Samsung Galaxy S8  Actually, after Samsung started using water resistance on the phone, the realizable impact has been on the phone’s audio. The loudspeakers have become softer after water shielding on them. Samsung Galaxy S8 may not have the loudest speakers but the sound it produces are crisp and clear, one can really get a great audio experience in a peaceful place. But when you connect your headphones or your earphones, this is where the phone shows it’s magic. The audio quality via headsets or earphones is a class apart since it supports 16-bit, 24-bit and even 32-bit FLAC audio out. You’ll probably get the best audio experience with a great bass punch or treble. If you’re a music fanatic and know how to play with the equalizers, this phone’s SoundAlive won’t disappoint you.   And, the pair of AKG tuned headphones that come with the phone are truly the best earphones you can find inside a box of any phone.  OnePlus 3T   When it comes to OnePlus 3T, its audio performance is actually underlooked by many. But in reality, the phone is the best phone for audio admirer who finds Xperia Z and iPhone 7Plus to be beyond their budget. Yes, the audio isn’t as good as the phones mentioned above but the 3T is by far the best sounding phone within its price range. Plus, it’s true audio capability can be experienced after plugging a headphone.  Sony Xperia X  If you’re an audiophile and find the phones we mentioned above to be beyond your budget then Sony Xperia X is the one you should be keeping an eye on. After  the latest price cut , the phone that was initially launched at 50,500 is now available at Rs. 38,500 in Nepal. The phone is the best pick for those after well-balanced quality audio from a smartphone that won’t get you bankrupt. Sony Xperia X’s front facing stereo speakers aren’t as loud as that of the Z5 but does produce the audio as good as from any premium smartphones.  Bonus Picks  As bonus picks, we are mentioning few smartphones truly designed for better audio experience. Though these smartphones didn’t officially make to the market of Nepal. They are found to be widely available in gray markets. So, how could we not mention them, right?  HTC One M9  We don’t have to talk much about the M9s speakers. These boom sound stereo speakers are the best compared to any smartphones out there. The positioning of the speaker is everything while you may have noticed some smartphones audio is completely blocked if your hand wraps, but the dual front facing speaker is a different story. These speakers are like having your own mini Boombox in your pocket. Sounds are pretty precise and immersive. You can have a class audio experience while watching movies or listening to your favorite tracks, these speakers will always keep you moving.\xa0HTC one M9 is priced at Rs. 57,000 in Nepal.    Moto\xa0X Pure Edition  Like the HTC M9, Moto X Pure Edition comes equipped with front-facing dual stereo speakers which produce pretty great sound. Well, it’s not that great compared to the HTC’s boom sound but it’s far better than other high-end phones. Speakers are pretty loud and you’ll hear every sound crisp and clear. Like the M9, you’ll have a great experience in watching movies as well.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sony-Xperia-Z5-premium.jpg']

The phone is likely to have a company of  Huawei GR5 2017 Premium Edition  at its launch event. So, this Friday, Huawei will launch two phones in Nepal.  Update:  Huawei P10 Plus Launched in Nepal for Rs. 79,000\xa0         \xa0Huawei P10 Plus: Specs Breakdown  P10 Plus comes with a 5.5-inch display with the protection ensured by  Gorilla Glass \xa05. The phone is powered by Huawei’s own HiSilicon Kirin 960 processor. On the software side, Huawei P10 Plus comes with Android Nougat out of the box with EMUI 5.1 on the top.  Huawei Mobiles Nepal teases the P10 Plus Launch in Nepal with a Banner in the streets of Kathmandu Valley.  Memory wise, the phone comes with two variants; one with 64GB of internal memory and 4GB of RAM and other with 128GB of internal storage capacity and 6GB of RAM. On the optics section, the phone has embraced a dual-camera setup on the back. The dual-camera setup includes a 20MP (monochrome) and 12MP (RGB) sensors lying on a horizontal configuration. This assembly has enabled the device to take astounding pictures even on low lights and with 2X optical zoom. The rear camera setup is also assisted by OIS (optical image stabilization), phase detection autofocus and Dual-LED (Dual-tone) flash. The rear camera is capable of shooting 4k videos at the frame rate of 30fps and Full-HD videos at 60 fps. The front-facing selfie camera has an 8MP sensor with an aperture of f/1.9.   The device is juiced up by a whopping 3750 mAh battery and in order to avoid the lingering of the phone with the wall charger, the charging mechanism uses SuperCharge fast-charging.

['OnePlus 5 launched: A OnePlus 3/3T with few modifications and dual cameras'],"['Android', 'OnePlus']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['June 20, 2017']",2017-06-20 17:47:33+00:00,"['Three years ago,  OnePlus  surfaced into the world of a smartphone with its first flagship – the OnePlus One. It was one of the most polarizing devices ever which started to gain popularity even with the annoying ‘invite system’. The performance and features the One delivered at half the price of other flagship phones truly confirmed its tag as a ‘flagship killer’. Three years and 4 devices later, the Chinese company has come up with a camera-centric smartphone which does not compromise on performance by any means.  [Update: One Plus 5 is now available in Nepal.  It is  priced at Rs. 59,500 and is available from retail shops and e-commerce stores (Oliz store & Kaymu).]  The  OnePlus 5  features some similar looking designs both at the front and back. While OnePlus didn’t opt for features like water resistance and edgeless display, it did go for the flagship processor of 2017 and an increased amount of RAM.         Talking about the new product, OnePlus’ head of North American communications, Eric Zarshenas, said,  “We’re pretty conservative. We’re trying to do only stuff that we think benefits the user. We believe in the mission of making the best overall offering. It’s not about being the first. It’s not being different. And that doesn’t necessarily get us a ton of press.”  Design and Display  The  OnePlus 5 , like I mentioned before comes with a pretty familiar design. At the front, the device looks like its predecessors, the  OnePlus 3  and  OnePlus 3T  with the difference being a little bit of curve on its four sides.   The design at the back has been a subject of much discussion as it shares its looks with the iPhone 7 Plus and the Oppo R11. There are dual cameras at the top left which is accompanied with dual LED flash.  The metallic back of the OnePlus 5 is made from anodized aluminum. This time around, the antenna bands have similar placement like that on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.  Unlike what almost all of the leaks suggested, the OnePlus 5 comes with a full HD display resolution. At the time when most companies are going with quad HD displays, OnePlus has stuck with the 1080p panel. Maybe this helps in cutting the cost of the device. Plus, unless a user is using a VR, he/she probably won’t notice any noticeable difference. The display has a length of 5.5-inch and is an Optic AMOLED panel. It is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 which ends in a 2.5D curve.  2017 has been the year of edgeless and InfinityEdge displays. But the OnePlus 5 has a more traditional look with 16:9 aspect ratio.  Camera   Undoubtedly, OnePlus is cashing in on the  OnePlus 5’s dual rear-facing cameras  for its sales. In the launch event/video, the presenters took some time to explain its cameras in detail. The device is equipped with 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel primary cameras with the former featuring a large f/1.7 aperture and the latter featuring f/2.6 aperture.  The camera on the OnePlus 5 has features such as Portrait mode, Optical Zoom, and Histogram. Just like the OnePlus 3 and 3T, it has a built-in manual mode to modify the camera setting according to user’s preference.  While the camera looks to be absolutely great on paper, we could yet be seeing another ‘more megapixel doesn’t necessarily mean better picture’ case here. The Verge and Mr. Mobile, popular review channels on YouTube, have already slagged off the quality of the camera with The Verge even going a step forward and calling the camera ‘mediocre’.  Processor and Hardware  OnePlus had already announced that its newest flagship would be powered by an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor with 2.45 GHz clock speed. This wasn’t much of a surprise as OnePlus devices always boast flagship processors. Like the OnePlus 3 and 3T, the OnePlus 5 is aided by 6 GB of RAM. The company is also offering an 8 GB RAM variant which is available in the 128 GB model. For the smartphone, the Chinese manufacturer is using LPDDR4X RAM. The OnePlus 5 has Adreno 540 GPU under the hood. There is, however, no slot for expanding the internal memory.   There is a front-mounted fingerprint sensor on the OnePlus 5 which has the capability to unlock the device in just 0.2 seconds. And yes, it does house a headphone jack.  Software   The OnePlus 5 runs on Android v7.1.1, again, just like the OnePlus 3 and 3T. It has OxygenOS on top which is like a stock version of Android on steroids. Users can expect a lot of customizations which can help in some useful system level changes.  The OnePlus 5 now comes with better calibration and a reading mode which can turn the screen calibration into a monochrome mode when certain apps are selected.  Battery  The OnePlus 5 houses a 3,300 mAh battery which is supported by OnePlus’ very own dash charging technology. We expect the device to last for 4 – 5 hours of screen-on-time under heavy usage. But Dash Charging’s fast charging will surely charge up the device in under no time.   The 3,300 mAh battery is surely a bummer for heavy users like me. I am currently using the OnePlus 3 as my primary device and even with around 5 hours of screen-on-time, I sometimes have to charge my smartphone twice a day.  Price  Carl Pei said at the launch event that all tech websites got the pricing wrong as the OnePlus 5’s baseline model is priced at $479 (6 GB RAM and 64 GB storage). The higher end model, which has a whopping 8 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory will set you back $539.  While the pricing might come as a disappointment to the OnePlus fans, this price tag was expected as the device comes with dual cameras and also because OnePlus has lately started to give attention to advertisements.  OnePlus will go on sale from the 27th of June, 2017 in the international market.  We are yet to receive a word regarding its launch in Nepal. But, according to some close source, the OnePlus 5 is all set to launch in July with an expected price to be around Rs.59,999. The phone will be available from oliz store and kaymu.\xa0  Here’s everything you need to know about the OnePlus 5:   5.5-inch, full HD Optic AMOLED display  Android v7.1.1 Nougat with\xa0Oxygen OS  Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor  6/8 GB of RAM  64/128 GB Internal Storage  Rear-facing cameras: 16 MP Sony IMX398 sensor with f/1.7 aperture and EIS + 20 MP Sony IMX350 sensor with f/2.6 aperture  Dual LED flash on the rear  Front-facing camera: 16 MP Sony IMX371 sensor with f/2.0 aperture  3,300 mAh battery with\xa0Dash Charge support  Front-mounted fingerprint sensor (0.2 seconds)  Bluetooth 5.0, USB Type-C, NFC, Dual SIM  Color(s) available: Midnight Black, Slate Gray  Price: $479 and $539  Expected Price of One Plus 5 in Nepal: Rs. 59,999']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/One-Plus-5T-scaled.jpg']

['This in-ear earpiece can translate languages without Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity'],['AI'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['June 19, 2017']",2017-06-19 02:13:29+00:00,"['Australian start-up: Lingmo International has come up with a universal language translator earpiece: Translate One2One. The device is powered by IBM Watson artificial intelligence technology and is said to be the first ever translation earpiece that doesn’t rely on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity, making it a perfect option for use in airlines and in remote area.  Provided that both speakers are wearing an earpiece, the device can efficiently translate conversations across English, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German and Chinese. The device uses\xa0IBM Watson’s Natural Language Processor and Language Translation APIs and Lingmo’s machine learning applications for translations. The earpiece has a built-in microphone that picks up spoken words and allows the earpiece to translate speech in seconds. Furthermore, an iOS app is also available which offers Speech-to-text and text-to-speech translation for even more languages.         The device allows almost real-time translation of spoken word without any Internet or Bluetooth connectivity. However, this isn’t the first in-ear device to allow this sort of translation.\xa0Waverly Lab had showcased Pilot, a translation earpiece, at the Mobile World Congress\xa0earlier this year. Just like Translate One2One, Pilot can also translate languages without the internet connection by downloading language packs from a companion app. But, unlike Translate One2One, Pilot requires a cell phone connection to work offline. Waverly claims Pilot to be the first ever in-ear translation device, even so, Translate One2One is the first to go on sale. The Translate One2One will be on retail at $179 (£140), and is available now for preorder.  The earpiece which was unveiled at the United Nations AI for Good, is said to have overcome common translation hurdles such as regional dialects. To simply quote an example given by Danny May, founder and director of Lingmo International,”At a simple level, I might be using slang to say ‘that’s cool’ and it’ll translate to ‘that’s cold’,”. It is pretty obvious that current translation apps really struggle with the natural language and conversational context. More often than not, they simply just offer literal word-for-word translation which, generally, translates inaccurately. But as this new device is backed by IBM Watson, these obstacles have been overcome by it.  Furthermore, May adds, “By eliminating the friction of the traditional translation process, devices like Translate One2One will not only remove one of the biggest challenges for professionals when meeting and collaborating between cultures but also offers enormous potential for communities around the world.” This certainly makes the device worth the try.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/In-ear-language-translator.png']
['Vivo Smartphone with Onscreen Fingerprint Sensor Leaked'],[],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['June 18, 2017']",2017-06-18 14:20:09+00:00,"['It’s been awhile since we have seen something revolutionary in the smartphone space. We have always witnessed the ever ascending upgrade of SoC, RAM, Camera, and smaller bezels. But recently, there hasn’t been a distinct feature that could really wow the consumers. This monotony could come to an end now as a recent leak suggests phones with on screen fingerprint sensor is on its way and could make it to the market by the end of this year.   We’ve been hearing about the onscreen fingerprint sensor since last year and everyone predicted it to come with the  Samsung Galaxy S8 . Due to few difficulty with the technology, Samsung dropped it from the S8 and scheduled it for the Note 8, claims few rumors. But before Samsung or any other major brand could show off this technology, a leak from the Chinese microblogging site Weibo showed off the on-screen fingerprint sensor on a Vivo smartphone. Now Vivo might be a name least heard of, but it is the producer of the slimmest phone(Vivo X5 Max) and the first phone with 6GB of RAM(Vivo xPlay 5). So, this time around, Vivo could be the first phone to sport an onscreen fingerprint sensor.         Looking at the video, it seems the technology hasn’t been perfected for speed. It takes more than 2 seconds to unlock the phone. We’re already used to swift fingerprint readers so until the similar speed is achieved, phones with onscreen fingerprint sensor can take some\xa0time to hit the market.  The same technology is supposed to make headlines with the launch of 10th anniversary iPhone which is supposed to come with on-screen Touch ID.\xa0Besides this, rumors affirm\xa0 Huawei  P11 and phone from Xiaomi will be incorporating the onscreen fingerprint sensor. With such technology, the major concern would be of durability . What if we crack the screen?

The first way to impress is with specs. That is by giving more than what competitors are currently offering. And the second way is with the price tag. And, this time around,  ZTE Mobile Nepal  is trying to impress its buyer both ways. The new  ZTE Blade A2 Plus  comes with the specs hard to find in its rivals and has been priced near to the international pricing.  As we mentioned in our last post,  ZTE Mobile Nepal launched the ZTE Blade A2 Plus  with 4GB RAM and 5000mAh battery at an attractive price of Rs. 23,900. You can also buy this phone online from  ZTE Nepal’s official Online Store \xa0that offers 3% discount and a free home delivery.  ZTE Blade A2 Plus: What’s Inside?         The ZTE Blade A2 Plus sports a  5.5inch Full HD  display with a 2.5D glass on top. Under the hood, the phone is powered by MediaTek  MT6750T  64bit OctaCore CPU clocked at  1.5GHz  and coupled with  4GB RAM . In case you don’t know, it is the same configuration as in\xa0 Oppo F3  that is priced at around Rs. 10,000 higher than A2 Plus in Nepal. But, unlike other phones with 4GB RAM, this phone only offers  32GB  of inbuilt storage. However, you may expand the memory up to 256GB by inserting a microSD card instead of your second SIM. The phone gets its juice from jaw-dropping  5,000mAh  battery that is something we don’t get to see in many phones. However, this huge battery comes at a price of heavier weight and thicker body since the phone weighs 189gm and measures 9.8mm of thickness.  This phone with a rear-mounted\xa0fingerprint sensor has a  13MP  camera lens above the sensor. It addresses selfies with an  8MP  unit on the front that utilizes screen as the flash. The phone supports fast charging and comes with 1.5Amp-9volt charger out of the box. The phone has few shortcomings like it doesn’t have a gyro sensor so this phone isn’t VR compatible. Another shortcoming is its software, that’s\xa0based on Android 6 Marshmallow. And, you can’t count on ZTE for future updates.   ZTE Blade A2 Plus: Specs Highlights   5.5-inch, full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) IPS LCD display  Android v6.0 Marshmallow with MiFavor UI on top  Octa-core MediaTek MT6750T with Mali T860 MP2 GPU  4 GB of RAM  32 GB Internal Storage  MicroSD card support (up to 256GB, uses SIM2 slot)  13 MP rear-facing camera, Dual tone LED Flash  8 MP front-facing camera  Hybrid Dual SIM tray  5,000 mAh battery  Rear-mounted fingerprint sensor  Price: Rs. 23,900   Verdict  The phone looks satisfying on paper considering it’s price. But whether it’ll be worth the purchase is something that will totally depend on how it performs in real life. So, we’ll certainly cover more on this phone in our future review. However, the phone had both positive and negative impressions on me. The 5000mAh battery and 4GB RAM fall in the positive impressions. Whereas, Android Marshmallow, heavy weight, and no gyro sensor fall in the negative impressions the phone had on me. For more coverage on the phone, stay tuned for its review.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ZTE-Blade-A2-Plus-price-in-Nepal.png']

But the same cannot be said about the S8 which looks much different than not just any Samsung phones but all other phones currently available in the market. The S8 won the title of “best design” not just because it’s different but because it’s lovable in every way. The phone with a narrower body and taller screen that is curved on the edges and has a shrunk down forehead and the chin is something you can’t wait to put your hands on, after the moment you see it. The device is slightly thicker at 8mm and a bit heavier at 155gm than its predecessor but still feels pretty good in the hand\xa0thanks to its ergonomics. The glass on the front and back and the aluminum rails along the edges blend seamlessly giving a feeling as if the phone is using single design element.  To get an impressive screen-to-body ratio of over 83%, Samsung had to do few trade-off like removable of the physical home button and newer placement of fingerprint sensor at the back alongside the camera. You can find more coverage on the fingerprint sensor and home button on the hardware section down below. Other than the power button on the right and the volume rocker on the left, we now have another new button below the volume rocker for Bixby. I’ll address more on the Bixby, down in the software part of the review.  Display   The Samsung Galaxy S8’s 5.8inch Super AMOLED display with the resolution of 1440*2960 pixels is by far the best display on any smartphone. The Samsung calls it an Infinity Display since the display melds down to the edges with those curves on both sides. This display with 18.5:9 aspect ratio looks a bit narrower and taller than regular 16:9 displays. It is with this new display that Samsung has been able to pack-in 5.8inch display in a phone with a footprint comparable to last year’s S7 that had a 5.1inch display. The display is pretty sharp, has a great contrast and colors, and is much bright outdoors. The brightness can be set dim to a level that doesn’t burn eyes while using the phone before bed. Plus, the display also supports HDR contents.  Samsung Galaxy S8’s display comes with lots of tuning options. Those options include a Blue light filter, 4 different Screen mode, basic and advanced white balance tuning options and much more. The best of all is the option to switch screen resolution among HD+, FHD+, and WQHD+. The display has rounded corners matching those of the phone itself. However, while watching the video contents with 16:9 aspect ratio you’ve to opt for a cropped content or pillar boxing effect.  Performance   The Galaxy S8, powered by Exynos 8895 Octacore CPU and backed by Mali-G71 MP20 GPU that is coupled with 4GB RAM, is an exceptionally impressive performer. The phone is fast and responsive and smoothly handles whatever you throw at it. The phone has left no room for complaining when it comes to app loading and the app switching. Plus, it has noticeably shorter boot time. I tested its gaming performance by playing different heavy titles. And, I had a pretty amazing gaming experience without any glitches and without any dropped frame rates. However, the phone does get warmer after a prolonged gaming session or after stretched use of cameras.  Hardware   The phone comes equipped with a fingerprint sensor that has been repositioned to the back since the phone no longer has the Samsung’s traditional Home button. Instead of the physical home button and capacitive buttons, the phone now has on-screen buttons that are customizable. Plus the virtual home button is a pressure sensitive one that senses hard pressures and gives strong haptic feedback. Plus, you can always wake the phone by pressing on the spot where virtual home button resides. The major problem with the device is this new positioning of the fingerprint sensor alongside the rear camera that made me smudge the camera glass everytime I tried to spot fingerprint sensor unseeingly. The loudspeaker still resides on the bottom and produces decent sound though not the loudest. It’s 2017 and just like we wanted, Samsung has still been showing love to the 3.5mm headphone jack that resides on the extreme left on the bottom.  Camera   When it comes to cameras, it has a 12Megapixel unit with an f1.7 aperture on the back and 8MP unit with an f1.7 aperture on the front. Both cameras using Dual Pixel autofocus technology are found reliable on any time of the day. The photos from rear camera come out sharp, vibrant and have good depth in them. Be it a portrait, landscape, macro, indoor or\xa0outdoor shots, the camera produces impressive results. The Auto HDR kicks in right when needed and the focusing is quick and hardly misses. I took 100 of photos and only deleted around 7-10 of them for missing out on focus.      Galaxy S8 Camera Samples   1  of 10                                                  Using ""Selective Focus""                       HDR Shot         Lowlight Photo                                          The camera app has a bunch of features along with the pro mode. But, with the auto mode that works so well, you probably won’t bother going manual. Other mentionable features are the selective focus that produces fake blurring in the background and the slow motion that allows shooting 720p video at 240fps. The regular videos can be taken up to 4K from the Back and 2k from the front. However, only the primary camera has Optical Image Stabilization that aids well while taking handheld videos.  The phone takes social-media-ready selfies and the shooting speed is fast too. The photos are good indoors and much better outdoors. The autofocus is pretty fast. The selfies come detailed but come with a bit of fine tuning even when the beautification is turned off. The camera app has inbuilt augmented reality face filters if that’s your cup of tea. Judging from the photos and videos I took at the time of my review, these are arguably the best cameras that I’ve ever tested.  Software      Samsung Experience UI   1  of 8                                                                                                  The Samsung Galaxy S8 runs on Samsung Experience 8.1 that’s based on Android 7.0 Nougat. Samsung has added a few flavors of its own and made the already good Android Nougat even better. Unlike TouchWiz, the UI now has shorter, sleek and smooth animations. Reaching the app drawer has now been made easier since you can reach the app drawer by swiping anywhere on the homescreen. The quick settings menu\xa0is far from what you find on stock Android and so is the settings menu. Like Samsung edge devices in the past, the edge panel functionality is still there that I used for first few days and now, I keep forgetting that it is there. However, you can reach people, task or app with a swipe from the edge when the edge panel is turned on. The icons on the S8 have rounded corners matching that of the display.  More to the Software is the Bixby which I was really excited about in the beginning. But after spending some time with it, I didn’t find it much useful. And, the Bixby vision is totally hit or miss. Since the Bixby is not fully functional as of now, so it’ll be too early to judge it. What annoyed me the most is the accidental presses on the Bixby button that keeps waking up the device when I didn’t want to. I just wish if there was an option to disable the button, if not remap.  Battery      Battery Usage Details   1  of 2                                      When it comes to Battery, after Note 7 debacle, Samsung is playing safe this time around. Samsung Galaxy S8 gets its fuel from 3,000mAh battery that takes one and half hour to fully charge with few minutes give or take. During the time of my review, I got somewhere around 4 hours of screen on time in a 15hours of battery usage. But I tried using the phone by setting the display resolution down to HD+, expecting better screen on time but to my surprise, the result was no different. Hence, S8’s battery performance is something that left me totally unimpressed. However, the phone supports Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging that charges the phone from 0 to 100% in one and half hour with few minutes give or take. You can also charge the phone wirelessly but such wireless charging pad needs to be bought separately.  Extra Offerings  There are few extra features in Samsung Galaxy S8 that we don’t always find in many other smartphones. The first is the security unlock using the face or Iris. The face unlock is fast but is less secure and the Iris Scanner is exciting but feels slow in everyday use. The second is the Bluetooth 5.0 that offers faster pairing, better range and connects with two BT devices at once. The AKG earphones that come with the phone are of good quality as well. The  breakage insurance  and free Ncell data are also worth mentioning offers on Galaxy S8 in Nepal.  Verdict      Samsung Galaxy S8 Gallery   1  of 8                                                                                                  Finally, it brings us to the moment of truth. Is Samsung Galaxy S8 the ultimate smartphone that I always wanted? The answer is “almost”. The answer would have been a solid “yes” if it had front firing stereo speakers, fully functional Bixby, better battery and better-positioned fingerprint sensor or faster iris scanner or more secure Face Unlock. That said, Samsung Galaxy S8 with Bluetooth 5.0 and IP68 certification that comes with AKG headphones out of the box, is the best smartphone that you can buy right now. Since you won’t find the LG G6 in Nepal. I just don’t understand why Sony is not bringing Xperia XZ premium here. And, HTC will most likely bring U11 after six or 12 months from now. So, unless the iPhone 8 comes out, the Galaxy S8 is going to be the King of the mobile market in Nepal.  What I liked about the Galaxy S8?   First thing is its  design . It’s undoubtedly the best looking phone that I’ve ever used.  Then comes its  Infinity Display  that is sharp, bright, produces good colors, has great contrast and has less or no color shifting even in extreme viewing angles.  There is no question on the device performance. And, the gaming experience was top-notch.  Galaxy S8 is without a doubt the best camera phone that I’ve ever reviewed.   What I disliked about the Galaxy S8?   Honestly, the fingerprint sensor positioning on this device is the worst placement for the sensor. I thought I would get used to it but the fact is, I didn’t.  There should have been an option to disable Bixby, if not remap.  I was expecting more than just 4hours of screen on time from a flagship device like the Galaxy S8.  Samsung should have avoided duplicate apps which just keep getting me confused on which one to use.   If you weren’t impressed by Samsung Galaxy S8 then here are some alternatives to consider:  iPhone 7Plus\xa0  iPhone 7Plus is an alternative to consider if you want better user experience. Since, unlike Android, IOS keeps things simple. Another reason to choose iPhone 7plus over the Galaxy S8 will be the timely updates. Since\xa0all the iPhones get worldwide updates the next day from it is announced but Samsung isn’t that known for timely updates. Other reasons for iPhone 7Plus to be a better buy than S8 is it’s slightly higher performance, better cameras with 2X optical zoom and better battery performance. But bear in mind, that iPhone 7plus costs a bit higher than the S8.  Huawei P10Plus\xa0  Huawei P10plus will be an another option to consider in the price range since the phone is launching within the month of June. It has whopping 6GB RAM and has a bigger battery of 3750mAh capacity. Plus, the flagship of Huawei wears Leica engineered dual lenses on the back that can be expected to perform better. Unlike Galaxy S8, it has stereo speakers and front mounted Fingerprint sensor. Though the phone’s pricing hasn’t been revealed, it can be expected to be priced near to the S8.  Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge  If you are after a flagship phone with good display and great cameras but think S8 doesn’t match your budget. Then you can still make a good deal buying the company’s last year flagships, the  Galaxy S7/S7 Edge . Both these phones are now  listed on \xa0“value for money smartphones” after their last price-cut.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-price-in-nepal.gif']

And even though you know copying is bad, some of you end up wishing you could do the same thing.  Well, if you are looking forward to copying a research, we suggest you to not to do so, as the oldest university of Nepal is looking forward to purchasing a plagiarism detecting software, and of course, it is ethically wrong,  According to  Republica , TU has permitted a policy to control plagiarism in research papers of Master’s degree, MPhil and PhD. This has surely got to be a welcome addition as some of the students of the University are into plagiarizing research papers from a very long time.        Tribhuvan University’s Vice Chancellor Prof Dr. Tirtha Raj Khaniya, who came into a huge controversy after reports suggested he had plagiarized whilst writing a paper for the NELTA journal, said, “This is an attempt to check irregularities. There is a serious trend of copying others’ contents and language without giving credit to the authors.”  All this comes as a move to discourage the ongoing plagiarism in the education sector. But some have criticized the university for the amount it looks set to buy the detection tool. According to some rumors, the software could potentially cost TU $20,000 to $60,000. But Khaniya has denied the rumored pricing saying it will not get as high as that.  But the fact that there is a free version of the application available has resulted in criticism of the biggest University of Nepal. Regarding this matter, Khaniya explained, “TU should have authentic full version software rather than the free version.”  Khaniya said, “We will go in line with the recommendations to implement the concept of the policy to work against plagiarism.”  Whatever the price Tribhuwan University pays for the tool, this has to be considered as a great addition to the ones who actually conduct research.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/TU_11.png']

And, very recently, we even announced the launch schedule of  Huawei P10Plus in Nepal . Now, we got a confirmation from a very reliable source that Huawei will launch both these phones on the same date. However, Huawei hasn’t yet shared the launch date but has mentioned we can expect to see both these phones this month. So, you can now expect to see  Huawei GR5 2017 Premium Edition  and  Huawei P10Plus  in Nepal before the end of June.  Huawei GR5 2017 Premium Edition: Specs, Price, Details  Huawei GR5 2017 Premium Edition isn’t much different than the regular  Huawei GR5 2017  other than the RAM and ROM count. It comes with 4GB RAM and 64GB inbuilt storage. So, you can expect better multitasking and take more photos and videos without worrying about the memory. Huawei GR5 2017 was already one of the  top smartphones under 30,000 \xa0and its Premium Edition will surely give tougher competition to its rivals.         Since\xa0 Huawei GR5 2017 already started getting Nougat Update  in Nepal, so the update will surely be available for the premium edition as well. As far as the pricing is concerned, there hasn’t been official words on it. When the Huawei GR5 2017 was first released it was priced at Rs. 29,999. So the expected price for its Premium Edition is Rs. 32,000. Let me remind you, it’s an expected pricing so there might be some marginal changes when the device goes official.

Anyways, Better late than Never, Huawei. The GR5 2017 is certainly a capable device both for photography and performance. But, it was a bit behind in the competition, at least on paper. Since it had only 3GB RAM and 32GB storage whereas most of the phones in its price range were already offering 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. So this premium edition certainly does cover the phone’s shortcoming in the storage size. But to judge phone’s value for money, we’ve to wait till the official pricing comes out.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Huawei-GR5-2017-Premium-Edition-price-in-nepal.png']

The company has remained silent in the past couple of months, though, with other smartphone brands already taking over its share. But the company has made a comeback to the Nepali smartphone market with its newest addition to the Canvas lineup – the Micromax Canvas 2 (2017).  The Micromax Canvas 2 (2017) is priced at  Rs. 15,300  — \xa0 much cheaper compared to\xa0its converted Indian pricing (INR.11,999). So, what do you get for all that money? Well, the Micromax Canvas 2 (2017) runs on the newest full Android version Google offers – Android v7.0 Nougat right out of the box. It has 3 GB of RAM assisting the Quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor that has 1.3 GHz of clock speed.         As far as the display is considered, the Micromax Canvas 2 (2017) showcases a 5.0-inch display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels at the front. The display is cloaked by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for that extra protection against drops. This glass edges out in a 2.5D arc. However, it has a plastic back for the fact that it is a smartphone from 2017. Also, the Canvas 2 has a separate home button which acts as a fingerprint sensor, and an on-screen navigation bar on the display. There are probably only a couple of smartphones with such a poor use of space.   In the optics department, the Micromax Canvas 2 (2017) has a 13-megapixel primary camera which supports features like Bokeh, Panorama, and HDR. The front-facing 5-megapixel selfie camera has a wide-angle lens and a f/2.0 aperture. The photos taken from these lenses are saved on the 16 GB of internal memory the device possesses. It can be expanded up to 64 GB via the microSD card slot available on the device.  The Micromax Canvas 2 (2017) can house dual SIMs, with both supporting 4G VolTE connectivity.

['Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Review: Value Driven'],"['Reviews', 'Xiaomi']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 14, 2017']",2017-06-13 18:58:05+00:00,"['There was a time when Chinese smartphones had to suffer allegations of being non-durable. However,  Xiaomi  has been one of the few Chinese smartphones which have assured the general public that even Chinese smartphones are packed with superseding specs and yet inside a durable skeleton.  Redmi Note 4 has been one of the products of that very brand, which helped Xiaomi to add fandom and has been one of the best-sold smartphones this year. Though the Redmi Note 4 was launched in Nepal long ago, the processor variant or the one with Snapdragon chipset is still a neonate in Nepali smartphone market.  Today we have Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 on our review desk, which is bundled with Snapdragon 625 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. The device costs Rs. 28,500 in Nepali market. Let’s dissect its features to find if the phone is really worth the price.         Design  Redmi Note 4 embraces a sleek body in a metallic outfit tapered at the edges. The metallic back on the device is escorted by plastic caps on the top and the bottom. I would have to say it a downgrade from the MediaTek variant, which is available in full metal unibody. The glossy metallic touch on hand gives a premium feel to the users. However, for its streamlined body, there is always a risk of slipping through the hands.   The device also inherits backlit capacitive touch buttons on the chin, which is customizable.   Display  On display, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 offers 5.5-inch IPS LCD panel with the touch of 2.5D glass on the top. The presence of 2.5D Glass has added elegance to the display and gives a lingering addiction to the users.   The display, however, lacks screen protection. Even on my careful use, the phone suffered few scratches. Though the display has a good viewing angle, the presence of Full-HD resolution is nothing extravagant for the price.   Hardware  Moving on, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 includes a power button and volume rockers on the right edge, which is completely accessible to the thumb. The SIM card slot lies on the left, whereas the IR blaster and headphone jack on the top.   On the back, camera and fingerprint sensor are accommodated within the metallic portion oriented vertically. On the bottom edge, the phone has two speaker grills defined in symmetry. One of them functions as an actual speaker, and other as a mic and between them resides a slot for micro USB 2.0 charger. The sound output from the speaker grill is decent, but while using the phone in landscape mode (that often happens while gaming and watching videos), the grills get concealed, and the sound gets obstructed.   The hardware also includes a tiny LED on the top to remind about the notifications. The blinking color of the LED is customizable rendering the type of notification.   Software  On the software, the device is favored by Android Marshmallow and flavored by MIUI 8.2 on the top. The UI offers a galore of useful features with most of them customizable to user preferences. Second space feature and App cloning through Dual Apps are not ordinarily found on custom UI. However, the UI does bring some unnecessary bloatware.   Performance  The device is powered by Snapdragon 625 chipset, which is an Octa-core processor running at the clock speed of 2 GHz. The graphics portion is taken care by the Adreno 506 GPU aided by 4GB of RAM. The GPU and RAM assembly has done a great job on the device. Even running multiple high-end games, I found no glitches on my play, and the performance was lag free. The device though got warmed up on the rigorous gaming. The heat so produced is, however, less as compared to the MediaTek variant on using same apps for the same time.  Battery  Xiaomi is renowned for its battery backup, and Redmi Note 4 has not been an exception. The phone comes with 4100 mAh non-removable battery. It provides backup for a day and a half on the normal use. On the heavy use, the screen on time fluctuates around 6-7 hours. The lack of Quick charging provision can be felt while juicing this humongous battery since the phone indulges itself with the wall-charger for a long time. The phone took nearly 3 hours of time to gain the full charge.   Camera  Talking about the camera, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 has a 13MP sensor on the back. The rear camera which takes decent shots on the well-lit environment with HDR on. On my use, some photos\xa0seemed pretty washed out without the HDR on.  On low lights, the photos were grainy and noisy. Through the “Manual” mode on the camera app, the user can adjust the ISO value to 3200, but the photo quality does not receive much of improvements. The 5MP front snapper takes good selfies but suffers the same plight as the rear one under low-lit condition.      Best shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 4   1  of 7               Auto Best shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 4         Auto Best shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 4         Auto Best shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 4         HDR shot Best shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 4         Testing the focus Best shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 4         Testing the focus Best shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 4         Selfie Best shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 4                                 Connectivity  For the cellular connectivity, a SIM card slot lies on the left edge of the phone. The SIM card slot holds a tray to accommodate two SIM cards or one SIM card with a memory card. So one should sacrifice the thoughts of employing two SIM cards with memory toppings by SD card in addition. Other connectivity option includes 4G compatibility, A-GPS, Bluetooth, Radio, OTG, and Wi-Fi (a/b/g/n). The dual-band Wi-Fi ac is missing on the device.  Conclusion  To conclude, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is a great built device with excellent battery backup. The fingerprint sensor on the device is snappy with almost instantaneous unlocks. Except for the fact of the heating issue on long use, the performance of the device is flawless. One could make a great use of it on gaming and multitasking.  The camera, however, is a bit of under-performer for the price. So if the camera is not your primary priority on a smartphone, then Redmi Note 4 could be the exclusive phone for you for Rs. 28,500. But if you do not want to make a compromise on battery backup, camera, and performance altogether while buying a smartphone then Coolpad Cool1 or Gionee A1 could be the perfect match for you.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Redmi-Note-4-featured-image-min.png']

These two phones come with Dual Cameras on the back and newly announced  Qualcomm Snapdragon 660  inside.  Oppo R11 and R11 Plus: Brief Overview  Oppo R11 and its bigger sibling come in a full metal unibody with Oppo’s “Arc Curve” design language. The Arc Curve is a name given by Oppo for a phone design with a back having curves on all its sides. New to the phone’s design are the two stripped antenna bands on the back of the phone placed on top and bottom edges. The design language, however, seems to be in a match with that of iphone 7 plus with those horizontally placed dual cameras and the antenna band above them. But it didn’t come as a surprise since it isn’t the first time that an Oppo phone looked like an iPhone.

While the reduction size means a constant fear of losing the buds at times, we can’t deny the functionality and portability these gadgets offer.  Before anything, I would like to talk about a tech company. Diifa-Tech is a Washington DC based company which has made its name for making ‘World’s smallest earbud’ – Dot headset. This gadget first surfaced on Indiegogo and raised over $715,000. It was then delivered to the backers. And now, after a couple of years, the company is back at it again as it has confirmed that another Bluetooth headset will go online on Indiegogo, just like\xa0the Dot.          Touch earbud is a wireless Bluetooth enabled headset which, according to Crowdcreate, was designed from ‘over 2 years of user feedback and community input’. The Touch comes without any physical button and has a touch sensitive surface which works via single touch mechanism.  The company behind Touch has kept fans under some suspension as it hasn’t given much information regarding its product. However, we do know that it has been updated with Bluetooth 4.2 and features a redesigned radio frequency module. The Touch will come in Apple’s Airpod’s like charging case.  Like Dot headset, Diifa-Tech has dubbed the Touch to be world’s smallest earbud. It is set to debut on Indiegogo on the 13 th  of June, next week. So, if you wish to back the project, log into  touchbuds.com  on the 13 th \xa0this month. Also, tune into Gadgetbyte Nepal as we will be updating you about the Touch in the near future.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/world’s-smallest-wireless-earbud-2.jpg']
['Leagoo T1 Review: Stylish Midranger'],"['Android', 'Reviews']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['June 8, 2017']",2017-06-08 15:30:29+00:00,"['There has been a recent boom in the launch of smartphones from Chinese Manufacturers. One of the latest competitors in the Nepalese phone market is  Leagoo .\xa0 Lately, I have been using Leagoo T1 for Rs. 16,500 phone as my daily driver. Let’s find out how this phone has treated me so far, in this review.  Design   Leagoo T1 is stylish looking phone with good built quality. The phone comes with an aluminum back with the aluminum volume rocker and lock button. On the metallic back, you get the fingerprint, camera and the LED flash. There are two plastic bands on the top and the bottom.        The front is covered with 2.5D curvy tempered glass that is smooth and feels nice to touch. Leagoo T1 has a typical smartphone design with an on-screen navigation bar and comes with LED notification light at the top. I found the fit and finish of the product quite premium and felt it was the highlight of the phone.  Display   The Leagoo T1 comes with 5 inch HP IPS display with decent colors and saturations. You will hardly notice the low-resolution display it offers. However, you will miss the sharps blacks and the saturation level, if you have been using an AMOLED display. It does have LiveDisplay that automatically adjust the color temperature of the screen during day and night time. The display of the phone is also equipped with Smart wake feature that lets you wake up the phone by double tapping the screen. You can also make various gestures on the screen to open apps like contacts, camera, and file manager.  Performance   The Leagoo T1 comes with a puny Quad Core MediaTek Processor MT6735 clocked at 1.3 GHz. The processor backed by 2GB of RAM and Mali T720 GPU, is no performer but surprisingly it gets the job done. App switching was average but the problem I had, was with the multitasking button. On this phone long pressing the home button led to the app switching windows which was\xa0painstakingly slow for me.  Software   This device runs on the year old Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Leagoo T1 OS on top. The UI is light and simple but I really didn’t like the icons it gave to the preinstalled Google apps like Chrome and Gmail. On the bright side, the OS does extend its support for third party launchers like Google now launcher. Surprisingly there are no such bloat wares installed, out of the box. The Leagoo T1 comes with many inbuilt features like Smart Motion, Smart Gesture, and Multi-windowing options.  Connectivity   The device has a dual hybrid SIM slot with support for 4G LTE. Due to the hybrid setup, you can insert either a microSD card or a second micro SIM. As I have said earlier the phone does come with a fingerprint scanner at the back which unlocks the device with precision. Having said that, the scanner does take time when the device is completely locked.  Camera  Leagoo T1 sports a 13MP camera with f2.0 aperture. It takes decent pictures in well-lit condition but fails miserably low light condition. It also has a slight camera hump at the back which is annoying. The 8MP at the front takes average selfies even in well-lit condition. Sadly both back and front flash are\xa0below par in low light situations.      Camera Clicks From Leagoo T1   1  of 7               Selfie         Fidget spinner Shot         Out Door Low Light Photo         Macro Shot         Macro Shot         Greenary Contrast Shot         HDR shot                                 Battery  The device houses a moderate 2400mAh battery in this sleek phone. Although this might seem small the device does amaze you with 6 hours of screen on time for my moderate usage. This is all thanks to its low power quad core processor. But if you go berserk by putting the phone to the 4G network and play games like real racing 3, it will give you a screen on time of 4 hours. The company claims it has fast charging but when I first received the phone it was at 1%. It took me more than 2 hours to charge the phone to 100%. So I don’t think it’s fast charging is of any use.   Verdict  The Leagoo T1 comes will many gestures and motion control features and has great design and premium feel with battery life that can last all day. So if you’re looking for a premium built phone with decent battery life and smart gestures, this might be the phone for you. But if you’re looking for a good camera phone with multitasking capabilities, this might not be the phone for you.

Since the contest was valid for “First Come First Serve” basis, many had been sitting in front of the computer to do their first dream sale. Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for the excitement of the “flash sale” to turn into frustration.  Honestly, even I’m the one among those more than 3k believers who trusted on MoonBau’s Wow Sale without a second thought. Yes, the website might have a technical issue but MoonBau didn’t respond wisely as a company. They should have rather pushed their wow sale to a different schedule, like tomorrow at the same time or today at a different time, that way its followers and believers wouldn’t be as mad as they are now. What they did was, responded with an uncertainty on when the Wow Sale will take place.

The One came with flagship features on a budget of just $349. Fast forward a couple of years, OnePlus has really started to make its name for the devices it has manufactured.  OnePlus 3  and 3T, launched in 2016, is still winning the hearts of customers. So, the company from China, which previously depended on invite system, is currently making an impact in the smartphone market.   After months of speculations and leaks, OnePlus is finally set to launch the OnePlus 5, the company’s (first) flagship for this year. It skipped number ‘4’ as it is considered to be an unlucky number. OnePlus is set to unveil the OnePlus 5 on the 20 th \xa0June. So, what is the new ‘flagship killer’ offering this year around? Let’s take a look.        Design  According to a recent leak, it looks as though the OnePlus 5 will come with a dual rear camera setting and an edge-to-edge display at the front. The image, leaked by Android Police, shows that the device will come in a good-looking metal backing with a horizontal camera set up which will be accompanied by LED flash. The leaked picture shows a minimal design at the back with a OnePlus branding on the middle.  It will indeed come with a headphone jack, a cryptic tweet from co-founder Carl Pei confirmed    Update:\xa0 OnePlus just released this image all over social media which showcases dual cameras. If the design is considered, the OnePlus 5 seems to share iPhone 7 Plus’ design factor.  Display  The previous five smartphones from OnePlus came with a 1080 x 1920 pixels display. 2017 could be the year customers will finally get to quad HD display in a OnePlus device as leaks suggest that the OnePlus 5 will sport a 5.5-inch Quad HD panel.   Regarding the type of the display, some rumors say that the shortage of AMOLED panel could result in the manufacturer opting for an LCD display. It will not feature bezel-less displays like the  Samsung Galaxy S8  or  LG G6 , though. But it could come with bezel-less sides.  Processor, Software, and Storage  Every year OnePlus launches its smartphones with high-end flagship chipsets on the inside. We can expect this trend to not change anytime soon. Plus, OnePlus has already confirmed that the OnePlus 5 will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset.   Accompanying the chipset could be an octa-core processor and 6 GB or a whopping 8 GB of RAM. Even Blass, a reliable leaker, has mentioned that the smartphone will feature 8 GB of RAM. Nonetheless, the Snapdragon 835 SoC along with 6 GB or 8 GB of RAM will surely suffice needs of even the hardcore users.  As far as the operating system goes, the OnePlus 5 will run on Oxygen OS on top of Android Nougat. The device will have ample storage as it will come with 128 GB of internal storage.  Battery  The OnePlus 5 is expected to be\xa0backed up by a 3,600 mAh battery. Some rumors suggest it to even have a huge 4,000 mAh battery. But it is hard to believe that the Chinese company will opt for such a huge battery.  Dash charge on the OnePlus 3  Nonetheless, the fact that it will be\xa0supported by Dash Charge is great. Also, it is said that this time around, it will be able to charge the new smartphone 25% faster than its predecessor which is cherry on top.  Price  OnePlus has made its name for the cheaper price point it comes in. It features flagship, and sometimes, some beastly specifications and comes in an under $500 price point. But the price of the 3 and the 3T didn’t go well with some of the OnePlus loyal customers due to its increased pricing.  While the pricing of under $400 for a smartphone with these many features would actually be sweet, speculations suggest it to carry a price tag of $500 which is an increase from the $439 price of the  OnePlus 3T . Android Authority has claimed the OnePlus 5 to come with an even expensive price of $650 as the company is using some costly components to build the device.

An addition to the newbie will be a 2MP camera and a LED flash on the rear panel. The speaker of the phone resides near to the camera, which outputs fairly loud and clear sound. Though the phone is blanketed inside a plastic casing, the phone has strong resistance to scratches and deformations during the falls.        Display  Because of the presence of keypad, the screen of Nokia 3310 (2017) is dedicated only for the displays but has nothing extravagant. The 2.4-inch display merely has QVGA compatibility. The pixel density of 167 PPI is fairly poor for the phone having a price tag of Rs. 5,250. Despite the mediocre display, the phone has a tough screen protector.   Software  Nokia 3310 (2017) embraces Nokia Series 30+ OS placing itself on the retro phone category. Though the software seems obsolete, it is fairly easy to use. It comes with a variety of basic apps and navigating them does not invite troubles. On clicking the menu button, the functionality of the device pops up in the form of apps like Call Logs, Contacts, Photos, Internet, Messaging, Snake, Mobile Store, My Apps, Camera, Apps and Games, Music, Weather, Radio, Videos, Settings, Notes, Calendar, Calculator, Alarm Clock, Extras, Files, Voice Recorder and Counters. Though the phone has revived the beloved classic Snake game, it is heavily revamped and is no more like the one found in Nokia classics.   Performance  The device boots up quickly and the performance too is snappy. I experienced no lags or stutters on my use. Since the phone does not have much of functionality, performance alone cannot be considered the guiding factor to call Nokia 3310 (2017) superior.  Camera  Gone are the days when the 2MP camera on the phone used to be an absolute deal breaker. So the presence 2MP camera on Nokia 3310 (2017) is a total bummer. In addition, slow image processing capability in Nokia 3310 (2017) showed a relic of antiquity.   Connectivity  For the connectivity, the phone has Dual-SIM compatibility, Bluetooth 3.0, FM Radio, and web surfing. For web browsing, there is a pre-installed opera mini app, yet, the absence of Wi-Fi on the phone obliges the user to spend phone balance for the sluggish 2.5G connectivity.   Battery  The battery capacity of 1200 mAh is\xa0a whopping amount for Nokia 3310 (2017) since it aids in providing 22-hour talk-time and a month long standby backup. So in the electricity-deprived zones, this device finds its scope and can also be used as a backup phone.   Verdict on Nokia 3310 (2017)  Since Nokia 3310 (2017) is a feature phone, there are no such features that could excite the users who are used to with the smartphones. The phone finds its scope in taking and viewing photos, playing videos and music. But the presence of trivial 16 MB internal memory is not sufficient enough to perform such tasks and seeks SDcard.  These days people have communication mostly through the means of social media. Since Nokia 3310 (2017) does not seem friendly for the use of social media, on the contrary to the Nokia’s slogan “Connecting people,” I would like to call this device a means to disconnect people. So this device could be handy for the people who seeks to get rehabilitated from the addiction of social media and smartphones.   The phone certainly has a pre-installed Snake game and the epic Nokia tone. But for the price of Rs. 5,250, I found no selling factor on the phone. So in my opinion, Nokia might have used nostalgia as the main marketing gimmick to sell the phone.  To sum it up, except for the people who have trouble using touch-screen phones, Nokia 3310 (2017) does not seem to satisfy the users. Also, the feature phones with similar features are currently available around one-third the price of the Nokia 3310 (2017). So, I do not consider it witty to spend so much of your hard-earned money just for the sake of the brand name.\xa0 Choosing\xa0 a mediocre \xa0entry-level smartphone for the same price rather\xa0 seems a better decision in my opinion. What are your thoughts on Nokia 3310 (2017)? Let us know in the comment section. [socialpoll id=”2444640″]']",[]

['Three new products that kept us awestruck at Computex 2017'],['Computex 2017'],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['June 3, 2017']",2017-06-03 17:26:44+00:00,"['Computex is one of the largest computer and technology trade show in the world that takes place annually in Taiwan. Themed with “From Mobility to Intelligence,” this year’s Computex show lasted for five days starting from 30 th  of May. \xa0Computex 2017 had apparently dragged a number of renowned tech companies, who presented their inexhaustible zest to evolve the tech world, here are three new products that really got us psyched about. 1 Asus ROG Zephyrus with NVidia Max-Q technology        Most of the gaming laptops have large fans for cooling, obliging a spacious design to fit the bulky skeleton. The fans that sounded like a hurricane while cooling is awfully annoying and traveling with such devices is definitely cumbersome. To cope with such problems, NVidia announced its Max-Q Standard for GTX gaming laptops at Computex 2017. The Standard opened the door for slimmer laptops to inherit a GetForce GTX 1080 GPU, and Asus ROG Zephyrus turned out to be the first one to be privileged.  ROG or ‘Republic of Gamers’ is the ultra-portable gaming laptop with GetForce GTX 1080 GPU weighing a mere weight of 2.2 kg fitting perfectly within a thickness of 16.9mm. For the size and the GPU embedded within, the device is expected to warm up like a fire. However, the Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) in the device keeps all the components cool. In Zephyrus, when the laptop lid is opened, a small bottom panel opens up allowing the fans to breathe in fresh air. With this design language, the interior air ramps ensure cool air to circulate always through the heat sinks. Since the CPU and GPU both have a dedicated blower fan radiator and heat pipe array with the later privileged by the second heat sink, the warmth does not remain adhered to the device and hence evades the burning sensation on the lap while gaming. The arrangement has also restricted the noise level to be 40dB at maximum.  The device also comes with a refreshing surprise with the trackpad – with a press of a button, it transforms from the regular trackpad into an illuminated number pad. The backlit LED in WASD, and QWER buttons on the keyboard can be customized to different colors to differentiate themselves among the other buttons in the keyboard. Asus ROG Zephyrus key specs   Processor:\xa0Intel Core i7-7700HQ  Operating system:\xa0Windows 10 Home / Windows 10 Professional  Display: 15.6-inch Full HD wide-view panel with anti-glare, 120 Hz refresh rate with Nvidia G-Sync  Graphics:\xa0NVidia GeForce GTX 1080  Chipset:\xa0Intel HM175  Memory:\xa0DDR4 2,400 MHz (up to 24 GB)  Storage: M.2 PCIe x4 256 GB / 512 GB / 1 TB SSD  Wireless: 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1  Connectivity:\xa0USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 x 1, USB 3.1 x 4, HDMI 2.0 x 1, 3.5 mm headphone and mic combo jack x 1  Camera:\xa0Built-in HD camera and array mic  Keyboard:\xa0ASUS Aura RGB backlit Chiclet keyboard with 30-key rollover; 1.4 mm key travel  Battery:\xa04 cell, 50 Wh  Size: 37.9 x 26.2 x 1.69 cm (with lid closed) and 37.9 x 26.2 x 1.79 (with lid opened)  Weight: 2.2 kg  2 Intel Core-X processors        Since the release of Core i7 processor, Intel has been somewhat mute in the tech world with no exciting product or feature to surprise the Intel fandom. However, the drought has been lifted up this year. Intel has been back on track with Core X-series of high-end desktop processors. The newly announced processors include even more potent versions of the existing Core i5 and Core i7 models with the addition of a new name to the portfolio – Core i9. In this new lineup of processors, the interested ones will have a choice to select the number of cores ranging from 4 to 18. Since Intel processors employ Hyper-Threading between the cores, the number of threads becomes twofold the number of cores (in most of the processors) making a maximum thread count of 36 and superseding the AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper.    Name of the processor  Number of cores  Number of threads    Intel Core i9-7980XE  18  36    Intel Core i9-7960X  16  32    Intel Core i9-7940X  14  28    Intel Core i9-7920X  12  24    Intel Core i9-7900X  10  20    Intel Core i7-7820X  8  16    Intel Core i7-7800X  6  12    Intel Core i7-7740X  4  8    Intel Core i7-7640X  4  4    Intel Core i7-7700X  4  8    Intel Core i5-7600X  4  4     New Core X lineup boasts 10 percent faster multithread performance compared to previous generation chips, offering extreme performance during rigorous gaming sessions. The presence of 36-threads and quad-channel memory has also made the Core X superior in content creation and extreme mega-tasking capabilities. Since the nascent chipsets have received an upgraded Turbo Boost Max Technology from Intel, enthusiasts systems can experience a boost up in the performance. Also, Intel has also mentioned that the Core X systems will dynamically overclock to higher speeds when needed resulting in enhanced performance. 3 World’s thinnest convertible        Asus began the Computex event by introducing a new lineup of laptops. Among the bunch, ZenBook Flip S turned out to be the one to steal the limelight and have been the talk of the town till the very end of the show. ZenBook Flip S comes with a mere thickness of 10.9mm making itself the thinnest convertible till the date. Statistically, it is 20% slimmer than MacBook and 55% slimmer than MacBook Air.  The convertible device sports a 13.3-inch display providing an Ultra-realistic Visuals with 4K UHD sensation. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass and is seamlessly embraced by NanoEdge super slim bezels of 6.11mm. The display also senses multi-touch and support Stylus. Flip S employs a durable ErgoLift Hinge to transpose its functionality as a laptop and a tablet. The Hinge also has additional functionality to lift and tilt-out the keyboard when opened past 135-degrees.  The device also embraces dual USB 3.1 ports, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, a webcam, a Cortana-compatible microphone array, Harmon Kardon-tuned 2-speaker audio and a backlit keyboard. For the wireless connectivity, Flip S has 802.11 ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1.  A 39Wh 2-cell Lithium-Polymer battery is provided to ZenBook Flip S, which keeps the device nourished. According to Asus, the battery provides 11.5 hours of backup. To avoid lingering of the device with the charger, Flip S is equipped with Quick charging technology, which helps to juice up 60% of its capacity just in 49 minutes. Despite all these astounding features packed within, ZenBook Flip S comes with a trivial weight of 1.1kg.

['Samsung’s First Dual Camera Phone: Galaxy C10 or J7 2017?'],['Samsung'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['June 2, 2017']",2017-06-02 11:12:47+00:00,"['In the smartphone industry, dual camera setup has been the new cool. It started with dual cameras at the back followed by the dual cameras on the front.\xa0The phone companies aren’t stopping there and aggressively launching phones with four cameras (two on the front and two on the back). If you’re wondering which phone has four cameras, then latest  Gionee S10  can be a good example. But surprisingly, the Samsung, the Korean Giant is yet to launch its first dual camera phone. If you were thinking the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be the company’s first dual camera phone then you were wrong. Samsung’s first dual camera phone will be either Galaxy C10 or the J7 2017.  Samsung Galaxy C10: Leaks (Renders and Specs)   The latest render leak from OnLeaks and Pricebaba boldly shows off the dual camera setup on the yet-to-be-announced\xa0Samsung Galaxy C10. The render leak looks promising with 3-strips antenna bands on top and bottom just like in the  Samsung Galaxy C9 pro . As you can see on the picture above, the dual rear cameras are placed vertically accompanied by dual tone LED flash. It’s hard to say whether the setup is of wide angle – normal lens or normal – telephoto lens or same lenses with RGB or B/W sensor. Anyways, my bet is on them to be wide angle and a normal lens. On the left, there is a button below the volume rockers and don’t get it confused with a power button which will rather be placed on the right. Like the  Samsung Galaxy S8 , this button is for triggering Samsung’s in-house AI, the  Bixby .        More to this, it has a USB type C on the bottom with a loudspeaker and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Thankfully, there won’t be an odd placement of fingerprint sensor and will reside below the 5.5inch display. The sensor will double as a home button just like other regular Samsung phones. Rest of the specs of the phone are yet to be announced and we’ll surely keep you updated. So stay tuned.  Samsung Galaxy J7 2017  It was almost certain that the Samsung Galaxy C10 will be the Samsung’s first phone with dual rear cameras until a new case of Samsung Galaxy J7 2017 got leaked on Weibo.  Source: Weibo (@萌萌的电教)  This cover has been claimed to be for the model no. SM-J7310. The leaks we have been covering on Samsung Galaxy J7 was for the model no. SM-J730. So, it’s more likely that there will be more than one model of J7 2017 and that will be region depended.  If you’re interested to find out leaked specs of J7 2017 then you may check it here:  SAMSUNG GALAXY J7 2017 SPECS LEAKED ON GFX BENCH  Verdict  So, if I’ve to put my bet on the first rear dual camera phone from Samsung then the Galaxy C10 is what I’ll put my money on. However, it’s likely that Samsung Galaxy J7 2017 will launch sooner than the C10. But just a case leak out of nowhere isn’t\xa0as considerable as a leaked render.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/First-Samsung-Rear-Dual-Camera-Phone.png']

Doing so is  ZTE ’s newest flagship the Nubia Z17, which, like its name suggests comes under the branding of Nubia.

There is also a 64 GB storage variant available but it comes with 6 GB of RAM.

['Gionee A1 Plus Initial Impressions Review: A Dual Camera Phablet'],['Gionee'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['May 31, 2017']",2017-05-31 14:23:59+00:00,"['Gionee recently launched the selfie focused  Gionee A1  in Nepal. Despite being a midrange phone, A1 has premium build and offers decent specs for the price. Now, Gionee has planned to launch the larger version of Gionee A1, the Gionee A1 Plus as early as the first week of June in Nepal. We got some early hands-on with the soon to be launched phone and here are our first impressions of the device.\xa0  Specifications of Gionee A1 Plus:   6.0 inches (1080 x 1920) @367ppi  Amigo OS 4.0 on top of Android 7.0 Nougat  Mediatek MT6757T Helio P25 Chipset  Octa-core (4×2.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4×1.4 GHz Cortex-A53) CPU  Mali-T880MP2 GPU  4GB RAM  64GB Internal Storage, Expandable up to 256GB  Dual 13 MP + 5 MP Rear Camera with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus  20MP Front Facing Camera with f/2.0 aperture  Non-removable Li-Ion 4550 mAh battery with fast charging  Expected Price: Rs. 49,999   Design:   The \xa0 Gionee A1 Plus \xa0on the first glance looks like a giant slab of glass with a stealthy dark finish. The device has a massive footprint with 6.0 inch of display. Picking up the phone, it feels premium with the smooth metal back. The phone is heavy at 226grams which is the result of huge screen real-estate, metal body, and a beefy 4,550mAh battery. Although the phone is almost unusable with one hand, the curved edges make it easier to grip the phone. So, despite the polished metal back and huge form factor, the phone felt safe in my hands.  A1 Plus comes with tactile buttons and I find the orange tint on the power button visually pleasing. It has got a fingerprint sensor on the front which also acts as a home button. It has got Incognito back and recent capacitive keys on the sides of the fingerprint sensor. The phone has Micro-USB port instead of the USB C that we’ve been seeing on many devices.        Display:   The 6.0inch display here is of full HD resolution with 367pixels per inch. A1 Plus comes with a 2.5D glass giving it a seamless look from the front. The display produces sharp and vibrant colors and I haven’t found any pixelation. The display gets really bright which helps for better visibility in the direct sunlight. Also, Gionee has included smart eye protection option which helps to protect your eyes by cutting off blue light from your display while using the phone at night.  User Interface:    Gionee A1 Plus is running of Amigo UI on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. Like any typical Chinese phone, it lacks app drawer and everything is right on the home screen. And by everything, initially when you boot up the phone, there are just tons of Gionee Bloatware. \xa0The phone offers some instantly notable and usable features like a swipe on the fingerprint sensor to bring out quick apps, double tap on the screen to lock the device and the smart eye protection. The phone also comes with Maxx Audio for a rich sound experience.  Camera:   The main highlight of the phone is its dual camera sensor where the primary shooter is of 13MP and the secondary shooter is of 5MP. The dual camera works together to provide depth of field effect in photos. This mode is accessible via the camera with Portrait Mode. I strolled around Patan with the phone and took some pretty good images. I haven’t got the chance to use the camera in all the lighting conditions so it’s hard to make any hard and fast fact about the camera.  Up front, it has got a whopping 20MP camera with f/2.0 aperture and it comes with tons of beauty modes if that interests you. The front also provides an option to shoot with bokeh effect despite the lack of secondary camera.  Performance:  Gionee has opted for a higher mid-range processor on the A1 Plus. The phone is powered by Hello P25 Octa-Core chipset coupled with 4GB of RAM. The phone is pretty fluid with no hiccups on general use. Installing and using some basic apps; app openings were quick and switching between them was a breeze. (Will be tested with heavy apps on full review)  Battery:    The phone is backed up by a decent 4,550mAh battery which seems justifiable for the given set of specs. It also supports fast charging with its ultrafast 18W charger which should completely charge the device within 2 hours. It also features a dual chip charging technology that keeps the battery cool and safe when the phone is being charged.  Early Impression on Gionee A1 Plus:   Gionee A1 Plus is a flagship phone from the company, it really has all the compelling features that one looks for while buying a smartphone. It is expected to launch with a price tag of 50k. For that price, you’re definitely getting flagship grade specs but the processor is a major letdown as the company should have opted for the more powerful Helio X20.  Gionee A1 Plus will go head to head with OnePlus 3T,\xa0Oppo F3\xa0Plus, and Galaxy C9 Pro.']",[]

Their latest processor was core i7 which was released nearly\xa0a decade ago. With many improvements along the way Intel finally accepted it was as perfect as it’s going to get. Finally Intel is back with its Core X-series processors, at least for its desktop users. This includes the\xa0 Core X-i5, Core X-i7 and the lastest member to the family the\xa0Core X-i9 and\xa0 Core X-i9 EXTREME.  What do We get in this line up?  Customers will have a choice from 4 cores to 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 cores. Almost all models will have Intel’s Hyper-Threading, thereby doubling the thread count.  The nine processors, at the bottom of the pack is Core i5-7640X and the Core i7-7740X with 4 cores clocked at 4.0 GHZ and 4.3Ghz. The are\xa0priced at $242 and $339 respectively.

Like the 6th and 7th generation Core processors, the 8th generation models will also be built on\xa014nm process\xa0with slight refinement. The 8th gen architecture is code named ‘Coffee Lake’.   Verdict  Most PC owners today won’t be able to take full advantage of an 18-core, 36-thread of the X-Series. But that’s not really the point.Is it? Core X exists less for the present than it does for the future. It’s for the high end desktop market.

Now, to take smartphone experience to another level through the hardware means, he just brought a new smartphone named Essential PH-1. On the hardware side, the phone has somewhat quirky specs but seems to offer greater functionality and usability than most of the smartphones of these days.  Essential PH-1 comes with a spacious 5.71-inch display with no bezels on three sides of the phone but a little on the chin. The bezels-less design reminds of the Xiaomi MI Mix but what makes the PH-1 different is the placement of the front camera. The front camera is placed on the top-center of the phone, with a groove cut out within the display. The display comes with 504 PPI pixel density with Gorilla Glass 5 protection.  The device is powered by Qualcomm’s flagship chipset Snapdragon 835 backed by 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage with no provision for storage expansion. PH-1 bears Ceramic back and with Titanium frame around. Titanium is tougher than the Aluminium and shows greater resistance to scratches and bends during the drops.         On the optics side, the phone comes with Dual-camera setup on the back with the megapixel count of 13MP. The dual-camera setup is the assembly of Monochrome and RGB sensors. The focusing of the camera is done by Phase detection autofocus and Laser autofocus. And the LED flash completes the rear camera assembly. On the front, the round groove within the screen is an 8MP sensor with f/2.2 aperture. It is interesting that both the cameras (front and back) are capable of shooting 4K videos.  Essential PH-1 ditched 3.5mm headphone jack but has added the magnetic wireless data transfer feature. The concept seems quite alike to Motorola’s Moto Mods in which custom accessories could be attached to the phones through the magnetic connector. So, there are rumors of shipping headphone dongles in the box as an alternative. Essential’s first add-ons include a 360-degree camera and a charging dock. The 360-degree camera can be clipped to the rear-end of the phone and can be used to capture 4K 360-degree videos at 30fps with the help of dual 12MP fisheye sensors.  The phone embraces 3040 mAh battery with the provision of fast charging. Essential PH-1 is priced $699 (£543) and comes in black, gray, white and green color options.

Compulsory IMEI number registration    This rule has been on tabs for quite some time now. But this time around, it looks as though it will surely come into effect.

This is probably the most exciting thing for me as it has always been a hassle when I have wanted to buy things online on the international sites.    Internet Banking    The Financial Minister emphasized that the government would encourage the banks in Nepal to provide the service of ‘branchless’ banking, internet banking, and mobile wallet. This is a welcome addition as it will save us from time-consuming banking transactions.    Telecommunication and internet service    I was really impressed when I heard the government’s plan of connecting all the Municipalities, VDCs and District headquarters via optical fiber through what it calls ‘ Suchana Marga’ . Likewise, the Financial Minister explained about the plan regarding the extension of broadband internet service to all the wards of the nation. He also highlighted on how the telecommunication companies of Nepal should work together in order to provide a managed and competitive telecommunication service to the public.

Since most of the mobile phones in the country are nastily overpriced, and the number of people heading for foreign employment is rising exponentially, people find it easy and somewhat reasonable to get the phones imported. This reason resulted in an uncontrollably large number of illegal mobile phones in the country.  So, to reduce the gray market of cell phones and to help control the criminal activities that are committed with the help of mobile devices, government primarily focused on making the IMEI registration of the illicitly imported cell phones mandatory.

That said, it is a completely new device as compared to the Oppo F3 plus with a different primary camera, display, processor and much more.\xa0This device can also be perceived as a successor to last year’s Oppo F1s with which it shares remarkable similarities including the design. Two months ago, I reviewed the Oppo F3 Plus which wasn’t the best device of the price range but yet, it managed to be one of the considerable devices in its price range. But can same be\xa0said about its toned down version, the Oppo F3? Keep this thing in mind, I used the device as my daily driver for a whole week. And here, I’m sharing my views regarding the different aspects of the phone.  Design  Starting with the design, there’s nothing unique about this device. It is yet another phone from Oppo that looks more or less like an iPhone. Don’t get it confused with a full metal unibody phone since it’s part metal and part plastic. Only the back plate below the camera is made out of metal and the rest is made out of plastic. There is a rough transition between the front glass and the side frame which I personally, didn’t like at all. So you must be thinking isn’t there any element in the phone’s design that I liked? Well, there are some and they are its lightweight, backlit capacitive buttons on the chin and the well placed physical buttons.         Display  The phone has a 5.5inch Full HD display which can be considered an upgrade as compared to the Oppo F1s. But the display didn’t impress me in real life as it first impressed on paper. This display was a true fingerprint magnet. And, when on direct sunlight the screen is super reflective giving me a hard time while using the phone outdoors. The good impressions display had on me is it’s Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection, good viewing angles, great touch response and thin borders around it.  Performance  Oppo has made some\xa0remarkable compromises in this phone as compared to the Oppo F3 Plus to make it\xa0more budget friendly. To point a few, the MediaTek MT6750T is its biggest compromise that has shown a remarkable impact on the phone’s performance. The load time of pre-installed apps are considerable but few post-installed apps took noticeably longer time to load. I played few graphics demanding games like Nova and Asphalt 8 on the device. But there were realizable drops in the frame rates, especially while playing Asphalt 8. And, the device keeps getting warmer on the top-right of its back plate not just while gaming but even while using\xa0social media, video streaming, and camera apps. Coming to bright sides of the phone’s performance, the phone’s fingerprint sensor was remarkably fast and accurate.      Oppo F3 Benchmark Scores (Antutu and GeekBench)   1  of 6                                                                              Camera      Oppo F3 Camera Samples   1  of 6               16MP, f2.0 Front Camera Sample         Oppo F3 Wide Angle selfie         Oppo F3 Macro Shot Sample         Non-HDR Sample         Oppo F3 Back Camera Sample         Oppo F3 HDR-On Sample                              Coming to the cameras, the dual cameras on the front did impress me just like the Plus model did but the same cannot be said about its back camera which performed just average. The selfies from the primary 16MP front camera look well detailed producing near-to skin tones. But the wide angle selfies from 8MP does come with noticeable distortion at the edges. Now, coming to the back camera, it isn’t anything phenomenal like the front modules. I compared few of its back camera samples with other phones of same price range and there weren’t much of noticeable differences. There were times its back camera underperformed as compared to the competition. However, it had slightly better low light performance and it’s RAW photo capabilities and expert mode for manual control are appreciable.  For the videos, the phone tops out at 1080p at 30fps. The videos from its back camera look a bit oversharpened to my liking.  Software      Oppo F3 UI (Screenshots)   1  of 12                                                                                                                                          The phone runs on Color OS 3.0 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. For a phone of 2017, the Android 6 sounds a little dated. And, the Color OS has the UI that might be preferable to iOS users than the Android ones. But it comes with few tricks up its sleeves like app cloning along with different gesture and motion controls. In this device, checking the notifications is bit clumsy and I personally, hated it a lot.  Connectivity  This is a dual SIM phone with another dedicated slot for the microSD card which can be considered as an added benefit as compared to phones with hybrid SIM tray. Throughout the time of my review, I didn’t have any issue with the network reception and performance both for the calls and the 4G.  Battery  Oppo F3 has a 3200mAh battery that easily lasted for a full day. However, it’s 2017 and the device neither has a USB type-C nor supports fast charging. And the 10W charger that comes with the phone takes longer than 2 hours to fully charge. For instance, I plugged the phone into the charger at 6% and after half an hour of charge, all I could get was 29% of added charge making the total battery charge to be at 35%.  Verdict      Oppo F3 Gallery   1  of 6                                                                              In nutshell, Oppo F3 does live up to its tag of “selfie expert” but I wish if it had a dedicated front flash. Taking selfies is one of the reasons to buy a smartphone but is not the only one. So, I don’t think this phone with average performance, dated OS, generic design and typical battery performance is worth the price of Rs.35,490. However, if you prioritize on a light weight phone with great selfie camera and the competitive back camera then you can never go wrong buying the Oppo F3. That said, if you are after a phone with an overall performance worth the price then you should be looking somewhere else.  During my period of review, these are the things I liked and disliked about the Oppo F3.  What I liked about Oppo F3 (PROS):   First and foremost, it’s the dual camera setup that let me choose between detailed selfie or a wide-angle selfie as and when required. Plus this wide-angle unit also can be used while taking Full HD videos from the front.  The fingerprint sensor is quite snappy and did unlock the phone with almost zero misfires.  Though the phone doesn’t sport a unique design, it’s still lovable and it’s light weight almost got me sold.   What I disliked about Oppo F3 (CONS):   This phone with MT6750t is just not the right device for gaming. So, the phone’s performance isn’t worth the price.  I didn’t like the fact that the phone is running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and Color OS 3.0 isn’t the one I’d prefer.  The phone has a typical battery performance and doesn’t support fast charging.  The display is a bit undersaturated to my liking and is a true fingerprint magnet.   If you weren’t impressed by Oppo F3, Here are some other options you can consider:  OnePlus 3 \xa0  If you already have a budget of 35K, the best is to add 5K more and buy the OnePlus 3 instead which will checkmark all the boxes for a phone with the performance worth the price.  Redmi Note 4  If you have a budget of less than 30K but looking for a better battery life and performance, the Redmi Note 4 ticks all the requirement — all thanks to efficient Snapdragon 625 SoC and enormous 4100mAh battery.  Cool 1 Dual \xa0  Coolpad’s Cool 1 is also an excellent choice if you looking for an excellent rear camera and reliable gaming performance. Priced at Rs. 30,996, it comes with a dual 13MP rear camera and a powerful Snapdragon 652 processor.']",[]

Finally, the long awaited internet connection from China to Nepal will be completed in a week. This is the result of the signed agreement between\xa0Chief Technical Officer of Nepal Telecom (NT) Lochan Lal Amatya and\xa0Executive Vice President of China Telecom Global (CTG) Ou Yan in Hong Kong on December 7, 2016. Therefore, from next week\xa0Nepal can purchase Internet Bandwidth from interested Chinese firms.   Re – Routing of Nepal-China Link  NT had entered into a bandwidth purchase agreement with the Chinese company around six\xa0months ago. Sadly, it had not been able to acquire connection till date due to the avalanche that hit the area during the optical fiber laying process. The avalanche disrupted connections on the Chinese side. The Chinese then used an alternate route to lay down the cable. A ton of link build and testing had to be done which led to this delay.        The Wait is Over  Presently, Nepal is only linked through Indian telecommunication companies via different optical fiber connections at Bhairahawa, Biratnagar, and Birgunj, among other checkpoints.\xa0Now, all the process have been completed and now Nepal will be connected to the world via Hong Kong through China Telecom. The\xa0connection is through the optical fiber from the Geelong (Keyrong) to Rasuwagadhi border point.This will end Nepal’s sole dependence on India to connect with global internet\xa0service.  Will the internet from China prevent Google Services?  As NT is buying bandwidth\xa0from China, users here in Nepal will not face any problems while surfing Google’s sites.

['Device Review: Gatekeeper device: The ultimate security guard to your PC?'],"['Gadget', 'Reviews']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['May 27, 2017']",2017-05-27 13:57:25+00:00,"['Our computer carries our private data, plans, and strategies. Some of them are so confidential that we do not want even our close ones to know. So leaving the PC unlocked in our absence can bring significant repercussions. Locking and unlocking the computer every time departing and approaching the device is annoying. So, to avoid this tedious job with the privacy maintained intact,  Untethered Lab  has brought a device named Gatekeeper, which locks and unlocks the device automatically and wirelessly sensing the proximity of the owner.  What is Gatekeeper device?  Gatekeeper device can be simply described as a key that locks and unlocks your computer. The device comes in the package with a key, USB dongle (like the receiver of a wireless mouse), coin shaped non-rechargeable CR2032H battery to power the key, and key strap to prevent losing this small device. The key inherits a rectangular shape that comes with a dimension of 45 x 25 x 6 mm and employs Bluetooth technology to track its distance from the computer. To use the gatekeeper device, the USB dongle should be inserted into the USB port of the computer. The second step should be to download the Gatekeeper software, which is available on the official website of  Untethered Lab . Once the user pairs the PC with key and inserts the credentials (PIN and password) in the software, the Gatekeeper device is good to go.         As the key, along with the user moves a certain distance away from the computer, the key sends the Bluetooth signal to the dongle to lock the computer. As soon as the dongle receives the signal, the computer gets locked. Likewise, the PC gets unlocked, when the key reaches the vicinity of the PC. Lock options and modes to get back into your PC after the lock can be selected from the software.  My experience with Gatekeeper device   I used this device for a week of time. During the time of use, I find the device very handy. The device uses Bluetooth 4.0, due to which, it is capable of locking and unlocking the paired computer seamlessly. During my time of use, I set the lock range (in the software) to Near. On the use, I had not been able to track the actual locking distance because it varied on every use. However, when the key was 4-5m away from the PC, I found my PC always locked. \xa0The device also comes with a small button on the left, which when pressed, beeps with a small green LED on and locks the PC. This button comes handy when the user is unsure whether the PC is locked.  For the small size of the key, I had troubles finding it most of the time. But when I discover the Gatekeeper app, finding the key did not bother me at all. The Gatekeeper app is developed by CoolCAD Electronics and is available on  App Store  and  Play Store . The app helps the user to buzz the Gatekeeper key and helps to locate it.  The security offered by the device is reliable. I experimented different methods to fool the Gatekeeper security and to penetrate the locked computer, but my every attempt turned futile.  To sum up, the device is very useful, where privacy is the primary concern. This device finds its scope to conceal the personal privacy, IT security, health care and government bodies’ confidentiality. The device is easy to use, and the security is reliable. I found no glitches on the device except for the locking of the PC sometimes even when the PC and key were in proximity.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Gatekeeper-device-Gadgetbyte-Nepal1.jpg']

But a handy app specialized for your location, that lets you look for hospitals near you and search for your health problems is a rare thing. Today we are reviewing such Health App specialized for Nepal called the Hamro Doctor. Let’s see how Hamro Doctor can be the solution for your health problems.  Opening up the app, we can see different categories to choose from. All of the primary functions of the apps are right on the home screen giving an easy access to all the main functionalities. Scrolling down a little bit we’ll see all the news and articles related to health.         Going into the  Hospital  tab, you can find almost all the hospitals in Nepal arranged alphabetically. From there, you can search for hospitals, view its contact details, no. of wards and all the doctors of that hospital based on their specialization. It also shows all the services that are available in that hospital. You can directly send a query to book or get a feedback on your health issue as well.   Moving on to the  Doctor \xa0tab, we can find doctors specializing in different aspects of health. You can also find information on which hospital the doctor belong to. But this tab doesn’t’ seem to be complete. Feature to show doctor’s schedule seems to be an ongoing process along with the Doctors contact information. So in the future updates, we can expect some improvements here but still previewing everything related to a doctor means violating Doctor’s privacy.  Blood Donor Service  is possibly the best service of this app. You can either sign up to donate blood or request blood. All the information of the donors based on their blood types are listed and you can request blood from any of them. I highly recommend anyone who is willing to donate blood to use this app to register as a donor as it can save people’s live for real.  From the  Ambulance  tab, you can quickly contact ambulance from different hospitals.  On the medicine tab, based on the type of health issue you have, you can quickly find the medicine related to that problem./     Also, a pretty handy feature provided by the app is to  Track Your Medicine . You can add multiple\xa0medicines you want to be reminded about and at what times you want to take them, then the app will give a push notification based on the time set.  If you swipe from the left, you’ll get the array of options. On\xa0the  Articles  section, you can find articles related to health which explains about causes and remedies of different occurring health problems. And o n the  Video  section, you’ll find videos talking about health issues which you can also see directly view from the  Hamro Doctor’s YouTube channel. \xa0On the  Disease  section, you can search for a disease and get a detail description about the diseases with symptoms, prevention, treatments and so on.  So Hamro Doctor is your one-stop app for all your health related queries and support. If you want some general information about anything related to your health then it doesn’t get any better than this. Sure there are few problems with the app like incomplete information about hospitals and doctors and sometimes even wrong information but that doesn’t stop this app from doing what it’s supposed to that is quick and easy look up for your health problems in times of emergency.

Well, this announcement didn’t come as a surprise since we already shared in  our last post that DJI will be announcing it’s selfie drone on May 24 . DJI already impressed the drone-maniacs with the release of smaller yet powerful Mavic Pro last year. And, this new drone takes the thrill to a whole new level.

DJI Spark: Everything you need to know  The first thing you need to know about DJI Spark is its new control feature that lets you control the drone with hand gestures.\xa0So, you can simply make the drone fly to the right, left, back and front with respective hand gestures. Plus, you can also take a selfie with the help of shoot gesture using both of your hands.  While controlling the DJI Spark using gestures, the drone won’t go any further than 10feet away from you. To increase the flying distance of the drone you’ve to switch to either smartphone-controlled flying or remote-controlled flying that will let you fly it up to\xa0300feet and 1.3miles away, respectively.        Image Source: DJI  The DJI Spark is super light as it weighs 300gm only. It has a 12-megapixel camera with a 1/2.3″ sensor, 81.9-degree field of view, and f/2.6 aperture. The camera can shoot up to Full HD videos at 30fps. The camera gimbal uses 2-axis mechanical stabilization.  The drone app for Smartphones will let you choose different intellectual shooting modes like QuickShot, TapFly, Active-track, Dronie, Circle and Helix. Quickshot, for example, will take a minute long footage and then turn it into a 10seconds Highlight video.  Other specs of the DJI Spark are   Maximum Speed: 50km/h (*with no wind)  Battery Capacity: 1480mAh  Maximum Flight Time: 15-16minutes  Dimension: 143×143×55 mm  Weight: 300gram  Obstacle Avoidance using: 3D depth sensing and vision position system  GPS GLONASS sensor   Pricing and Availability  DJI has started taking pre-orders of the drone in the US\xa0at a strating price of $499. The drone will have its first shipping starting from June 15. The drone is available in four different color options:\xa0sky blue, metal green, alpine white and lava red. DJI has introduced\xa0a “Fly More” bundle that comes with an additional battery, analog remote controller, extra pair of propellers, propeller guards, charging hub, shoulder bag, and few other cables. To buy this bundle, one needs to pay additional\xa0$200.  There hasn’t been a word from DJI distributors in Nepal regarding the availability and pricing of DJI Spark in Nepal. However, it’s likely that this mini-drone from DJI will eventually make to the market of Nepal after few months from international launch.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DJI-Spark-Specs.png']

If you are a fan of Xiaomi smartphones and thinking to buy one but unable or uninterested because of the repulsive price segment then this could be your chance as Vatsal Impex has slashed the price of two smartphones.

['Nepali App review: Nepzy | Your next E-wallet?'],['Reviews'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['May 23, 2017']",2017-05-23 11:32:26+00:00,"[""Even in Nepal, we can realize the advancements in technology. As compared to international trends, yes, changes come a little slow but they make it up to here eventually. Especially, e-commerce and online payment systems are emerging aggressively in the market of Nepal. Realizing this, we thought of reviewing an online payment app designed for Nepal and that’s  Nepzy.  What’s Nepzy?  Nepzy is a newly introduced online utility payment solution exclusively for Nepal. Other than mobile recharges, one can do his/her other utility payments such as Landline bills,\xa0Internet/ISP, TV/DTH and Electricity bill payments. The service is not limited to recharges and bill payments since users can also do domestic flight ticketing online by using its app or the website. As an extended service, Nepzy is planning to launch another new feature of booking hotels.    Nepzy\xa0App Review         User Interface (UI)  Nepzy is currently available on both mobile platforms of android and iOS. However, we reviewed the app on an android device. Regardless of mobile platform, the UI is pretty identical. The UI of the app is pretty eye catching and well organized giving a good user experience. You can easily know what the app does right from its homescreen. So it is all about bill payment and recharges and flight ticketing. You can easily navigate through the app by swiping from the left edge of the screen or by clicking on three bars menu key on top. Then it reveals the navigation tree for the app that allows you to go to your profile, check your nepzy wallet, your transaction details and much more.  App’s Feature and Services  The app’s key feature and services can broadly be\xa0classified into two two and that’s  recharge  and  flight . From the Recharge service, one can easily recharge his/her mobile, Landline,\xa0ADSL, DishHome and SimTV accounts. And from the flight service, one can easily buy domestic flight tickets for both one way or round trip.   Way to recharge Nepzy E-Wallet  Recharging\xa0of the Nepzy E-Wallet can be done in four different ways and they are using SCT cards, Nepzy Cashcards, e-banking of partner banks and by using promo code. Plus, the wallet can be transferred between any two Nepzy Accounts. So you can easily borrow or lend money between friends.  Payments within the app  The payments done in the app should not always be from the wallet. If you’re skeptical to load your wallet\xa0with a bigger sum of money then you can still do payments directly from your bank accounts in partner banks using the e-banking service. And, while paying using the e-banking you’ll be directed to the respective bank’s e-banking site with the Nepzy App.  Securtiy  Nepzy is secured with 128 bit\xa0 EV SSL . Additionally, it is\xa0 GODADDY.COM , and Nepzy strictly follows\xa0 PCI compliance . If you are not a technical guy, it basically means you don’t need to worry while punching in those credit card numbers.  Bugs and Crashes  There weren’t much of bugs in the app other than while trying to set my date of birth in my account the calendar could be navigated only to the future. Coming, to the crashes, the app never crashed on me\xa0throughout the time of my review.  Verdict      Nepzy UI Screenshots   1  of 3               Nepzy- Recharge UI         Flight Booking UI Nepzy         Nepzy's App home User Interface                     Nepzy is an easy-to-go-through app. That doesn’t take long to get used to. On the UI side, the app is pretty strong. But what it lacks is the functionality and features. So, for this app to be a tough rival to its competitors, it certainly needs to provide more services. So, if you are looking for an app to recharge your mobile, landline, ADSL and dishhome then this could be a great choice. Plus, this app might be a boon for those looking forward to an app that’s capable of domestic flight ticketing online.  As long as we won’t have a Paypal or Paypal equivalent stable system of online payment, we’re sure to see more of such emerging payment systems here. From a users point of view, it’s good to have more options. Since that way, the service providers will be in competition and we’ll be getting better and cheaper services along with promotional offers.""]",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/download-Nepzy-for-Android.jpg']

['Instagram- Adding fuel to the fire of mental health crisis'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['May 21, 2017']",2017-05-21 08:24:48+00:00,"['According to a new report, published by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) and the Young Health Movement (YHM) found in the UK, Instagram has been found to be the worst social media site in terms of its impact on the mental health of young people, followed closely by Snapchat.  The study was conducted among 1,479 youngsters aged 14 to 24 to evaluate what sort of impact was created by social media on the user’s health. Issues regarding anxiety, depression, self-identity among others were giving primary focus. The survey examined the negative effects of five social media platforms: Instagram, Snapchat,Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. As per the survey, Instagram was found to be the most harmful social network, followed closely by Snapchat. Facebook, Twitter and Youtube were the third, fourth and least harmful social networks respectively.  “Social media has been described as more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol, and is now so entrenched in the lives of young people that it is no longer possible to ignore it when talking about young people’s mental health issues,” said Shirley Cramer, chief executive of RSPH.         Understanding the negative impact that these social platforms have created RSPH and YHM are now calling on social media platforms to introduce a “heavy usage” pop up warning to notfy users if they have been online for too long. This idea was recommended by 7 out of 10 participants of the survey. Another recommendation put forward suggests identification of users who could be suffering mental health problems with the help of their posts and discretely signposting them to where they can seek help.  Instagram, an image-saturated app which boasts over 700 million users worldwide, seemed noticably harmful among young women, stated the report. Matt Keracher, author of the report said,”Instagram draws young women to compare themselves against unrealistic, largely curated, filtered and Photoshopped versions of reality.” An anonymous female correspondent has complied, “Instagram easily makes girls and women feel as if their bodies aren’t good enough as people add filters and edit their pictures in order for them to look perfect.” Keeping this in mind, RSPH and YHM have suggested that social platforms highlight the posts that have been digitally processed, to let people know when images have been altered so that users don’t take the images on face value as real.  We must understand that social media sites are a platform for expression, however, they also provide us with highly curated versions of the people we know and the world around us and thus, easily distorts our perspective of reality.   While a number of negative effects about Instagram were pointed out by the survey, the platform was praised when it came to self-expression and self-identity. Responding to the survey results, Michelle Napchan, head of policy at Instagram said,” Keeping the app a safe and supportive place is its top priority – especially when it comes to young people.” She further added that every day people from all over the world used Instagram to share their own mental health journey and get support from the community. Nanchan continued: “For those struggling with mental health issues, we want them to be able to access support on Instagram when and where they need it. That’s why we work in partnership with experts to give people the tools and information they need while using the app, including how to report content, get support for a friend they are worried about, or directly contact an expert to ask for advice on an issue they may be struggling with.”  Dr. Becky Inkster, honorary research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said: “Young people sometimes feel more comfortable talking about personal issues online. As health professionals, we must make every attempt to understand modern youth culture expressions, lexicons, and terms to better connect with their thoughts and feelings.” Out of those five platforms, YouTube was ranked as the best place to visit to gain awareness about other people’s health experiences.  Most of us, needless to say, have seem to have developed an inclination towards either one of these social networking sites. Socializing from behind a screen can also be uniquely isolating, obscuring mental health challenges even more so than usual. It is necessary to keep ourselves and those around us informed about the positive as well as negative aspects of all social networking sites and stay on alert for any signs of mental health issues of our “friends and followers”. It is our moral duty to provide help whenever possible. So let’s say yes to being social and humane.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/why-you-should-stop-using-instagram.jpg']

J7 Prime (16GB)  If you are here to find out how this model differs from regular J7 Prime then\xa0there isn’t much. The only difference is the storage capacity. This new model has double (32GB) the storage capacity of  regular J7 prime (16GB) . Rest of the specs of the phone are identical.  Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime (32GB): What’s Inside?  Samsung Galaxy J7 prime is a beautiful metal unibody phone from Samsung in lower midrange smartphone category. This phone has a  5.5inch Full HD LCD  display. Under the hood,  Exynos 7870 octa-core CPU  coupled with  3GB RAM . By now, you must have already known that it comes with  32GB storage  that is expandable via microSD card of up to 256GB. Unlike phones with hybrid dual SIM tray, here you may use two SIM cards and a memory card at the same time. The  13MP, f1.9  unit on the back and  8MP, f1.9  unit on the front will satisfy one’s mobile photography needs. It has a  front-mounted fingerprint sensor  that doubles as the home button.

But the bitter reality is, the phone’s arrival is a little late. If it’s the storage capacity in a phone that you prioritize the most, then there are already a few phones in the price range with up to 64GB of inbuilt storage. However, Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime is still one of the  phones to consider in the price range of under 30,000 . So, it’s likely that brand loyal Samsung fans will certainly find this news more exciting than anyone else.

['Xiaomi Redmi 4X Review: Is it the new budget king?'],"['Android', 'Reviews', 'Xiaomi']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['May 18, 2017']",2017-05-18 16:53:31+00:00,"['The trend of launching smartphones every now and then has certainly brought competitions among manufacturers. So much so that even different models of the same manufacturer are going head to head against each other. Doing so is the newly launched Xiaomi Redmi 4X which will be facing competition from Xiaomi’s own Redmi 3s and Redmi Note 2 if its pricing is considered. So how does this Rs.  18,499  worth of device perform in real life? Let’s find out in this review.  Xiaomi Redmi 4X in a nutshell:   5-inch HD IPS LCD Display  1.4GHz Octa-Core Snapdragon 435 Processor  2GB RAM With 16GB ROM (expandable up to 256GB, uses SIM2 slot)  13MP, f/2.0, LED Flash rear-facing camera  5MP, f/2.2 front-facing Camera  Dual Hybrid SIM; 4G\xa0LTE  WiFi\xa0802.11 b/g/n;\xa0Bluetooth 4.2;\xa0A-GPS; FM Radio; accelerometer; gyro; proximity; compass  Infrared Sensor  4100mAh Battery  Fingerprint Scanner (Rear-mounted)  Available Color:\xa0Champagne Gold and Matte Black  Latest Price: Rs. 14,499 (3/32 GB) [Last updated on: December 6, 2018]   Design   The Xiaomi Redmi 4X is a handsome looking lad wearing a metal backing which has made the device feel premium. Engraved on the metal backing is a fingerprint sensor. There are two plastic bands on the top and bottom with a camera and LED flash sitting on the top band.        At the front, the Redmi 4X sports a typical smartphone design. On the bottom are capacitive buttons, which aren’t lit thus giving me a hard time in the dark environment. Below them is a LED sensor which hardly blinked except for when I was charging my device.   The volume rockers and the power button on the right are tactile and placed precisely where my thumb rests. There is the SIM card slot on the left side. The top has an IR sensor and a headphone jack. There are two speaker grills on the bottom with one of them serving as an actual speaker and the other one as a mic.  The compact body of the device really makes one-handed use easy. I really liked the design of the Redmi 4X except for the small black band around the display.  Display   The Xiaomi Redmi 4X comes with a 5-inch IPS LCD display with the resolution of 720 x 1280 and 294 ppi. The display is bright and eye-pleasing but lacks saturation and sharpness like AMOLED displays. But during my time of using the device, I hardly felt the lack of 1080p display. The Redmi 4X also lets you change the warmth of the display. Since I like cooler displays, I opted to decrease the warmth of the display.  The only thing I didn’t like about the display is the black band around the display. Yes, I am sensitive to even the thinnest of the black band around the display. Also, since it has a metal backing, the device is extremely slippery and I dropped it a couple of times while using it.  Performance  The Xiaomi Redmi 4X comes with an Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 CPU with a clock speed of 1.4 GHz. This processor, aided by 2GB of RAM and Adreno 505 GPU, failed to impress me. The device constantly underperformed while gaming. The app switching was a pain and the apps didn’t respond, that too, a lot of times, sometimes even force closing itself. I haven’t still figured out why it is doing this. The fact that even the keyboard takes a while to come up doesn’t help its cause.   Vatsal should have also launched the 3GB RAM variant for power hungry users.  Software      Xiaomi Redmi 4X Software   1  of 7                                                                                        This device runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with Xiaomi’s MIUI 8 on top. Even though it runs on a skinned version of android, the UI is eye-pleasing and has only a couple of unnecessary bloatware. The Redmi 4X comes equipped with different software features. It lets you use dual apps on the same device. So, you can add two different accounts of Facebook, Whatsapp or Viber in the same device. You can also make a different account altogether. This feature is like guest mode on computers.  One thing I liked about the software is that I didn’t have to tune down the animation scale, which I usually do in the devices I review because of the loading time.  Hardware   Storage wise, the Redmi 4X comes with 16GB of internal memory which is expandable up to 128GB, the downside being you will have to choose between a second SIM card and the microSD card. The single mono speaker at the bottom is only decent. Plus, it gets covered easily whenever I use it in landscape mode, especially while gaming and watching videos. The other speaker grill serves as a dedicated mic. There is another mic on the device for active noise cancellation.  The device lacks USB Type-C connectivity, but that is to be expected from a smartphone worth Rs. 18,500.  Camera   The Xiaomi Redmi 4X is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. It takes decent pictures in well-lit conditions. But like every other smartphone camera, it suffers under low light as the pictures come out grainy and noisy. There are different filters in the inbuilt camera app. It also lets you shoot on ‘Pro mode’ by tweaking the ISO among others. The front-facing 5-megapixel camera takes social media ready pictures. It, like the rear-facing camera, is a pain in dark environment.      Xiaomi Redmi 4X camera sample   1  of 4                                                          Connectivity   Connectivity wise, the Xiaomi Redmi 4X has a Dual hybrid SIM slot which supports 4G LTE. I really liked the fact that Xiaomi opted with an IR sensor. The IR Sensor serves as the hub between the smartphone and different electronic devices. The Mi Remote app has a user-friendly interface and features tons of different devices to choose from. A fingerprint scanner sits at the back. It unlocks the device without any hiccups. However, it takes just a bit more time to unlock when the device is completely locked.  Battery   Undoubtedly, the best feature of the Xiaomi Redmi 4X is its battery. It houses a huge 4,100 mAh battery in a thin and light body. The screen-on-time of the device fluctuated at times. On average, I got around 5 – 6 hours of screen-on-time under heavy usage. My usage consisted of frequent gaming, internet browsing, calling and texting. If you are a moderate user, who doesn’t use their smartphone all the time, you should easily get around a day and half of battery life easily. However, before using the Redmi 4X as a primary device, I thought I would be getting more screen-on-time than what I actually got.  Verdict   So, all in all, the Xiaomi Redmi 4X comes in a good-looking metal body and has a huge battery. It has quite a good display for the fact that it is of HD quality. I really liked its design and the inclusion of the IR sensor. But that doesn’t necessarily cover up the fact that the device isn’t a great multitasker. Playing high-end games or going through different apps isn’t its stronghold. So, if you are in the market for a device with a good design, display, and battery, the Xiaomi Redmi 4X could be your next device. But if performance is what you’re looking for, I suggest you look somewhere else.

And lately, messages to Gadgetbyte Nepal’s Facebook page have lately been about Nokia’s relaunch here after we mentioned about its launch in  this article .   So, after months of waiting, Paramount Electronics Pvt. Ltd, the authorized distributor of Nokia in Nepal, has finally brought Nepal’s beloved brand back to Nepal. While it was previously thought that the Nokia 6 would be the HMD Global’s first device to land in Nepal, Paramount Electronics has launched the classic Nokia 3310 here. And for those of you who are waiting for the Nokia smartphones running on Android, the company has said that they will fly into Nepal by the end of this month (Jestha). The Nokia 6, according to the distributor, will launch in Ashar.         The ‘revamped’ version of the ever-popular Nokia 3310 is by no means a flagship device. It comes with some outdated specs and runs on Nokia Series 30+. However, there have been some changes from the older Nokia 3310 which made around 126 million unit sells.  The Nokia 3310 comes with 2.4-inch display form factor. This display is of QVGA quality. Storage wise, the device supports up to 32 GB of external storage along with the low 16MB of internal storage.  The Nokia 3310 comes with a 2-megapixel rear-facing camera which is accompanied by a LED flash. Even though it is a mobile phone of the year 2017, it only supports 2G connectivity.   The older Nokia 3310’s battery was an absolute beast by all means and you might have come across lots of meme relating to this matter. And, on paper, the battery of the newer classic doesn’t disappoint. It houses a 1200 mAh battery which, according to the manufacturer, can last up to 31 days on standby.   Even though the Nokia 3310 is by no means a smartphone, I am still excited to get my hands on the device. It surely will bring back some memory as it was the first ever mobile phone I had used. Oh, and the inclusion of the Snake game is a cherry on the cake.  Snake game in the Nokia 3310.

['Android O: New Features of next version of Android displayed at Google I/O'],['Android'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['May 18, 2017']",2017-05-18 10:26:33+00:00,"['If you missed on yesterday’s  Google I/O’17’s live streaming  and don’t feel like going back to the youtube to watch hours long video, to explore the new features of next version of Android, then you’ve come to the right place. Here we’ve listed the top new features of the next version of Android, the  Android O . But, still the possible Android 8.0 hasn’t got its full name so\xa0let’s address it with its well-known codename for now. We’ll mention its possible names at the end of this article with a poll, so don’t forget to drop your vote in the poll.  Android O: New Features  Picture-in-Picture   This new picture-in-picture (PIP) mode lets the user continue watching the YouTube video\xa0in a small window over the\xa0homescreen.\xa0They can still keep that video as a small floating window even while navigating through different apps. In current developer preview, only limited apps are supporting PIP including Google Maps. To activate this feature, the user has to tap on the home button and then the small floating window of the supported app will appear\xa0on the homescreen. The user can then reposition it to any of the four corners of the screen.        Notification Dots  Source: XDA-Developers  The another new feature is the notification dots that appear on top of the\xa0app icon when the app receives a new\xa0notification or notifications. That way, you can now check the notifications without having to draw the notification shades from the top of status bar. To reveal the notifications from the app icon, the user needs to long press on the app icon with notification dots.  Autofill Support   If you’ve used a chrome before, you must have an idea of how autofill works once you log into the chrome with your Gmail\xa0account. Your username and password details for different web services can be saved to your chrome account. Then every time you go to the log-in screen of webpage for which you already have saved credentials of, then the chrome will autofill those username/email and password parts. The same experience will now be available for the Android with this new version of Android, the Android O. So, it’ll get much easier to log into different apps on Android.  Smarter Text Highlight  With the next version of Android, selecting names, phone number, location and other details will become much easier. You may highlight the name, number, or such details by double tapping on it and then you can not just copy those text but also use them in other apps to act further. For example, if it’s a location detail then you can double tap on it and load that location on Google maps. And, if it’s a phone number then you can add to contacts or even make a phone call after highlighting it by doubling tapping.  Adaptive Icons   Android is far from uniformity and it can be realized more on icons depart. Few android phones have rounded icons, whereas few have circular icons and some even have flat rectangular icons. So, it wouldn’t look matching when a newly installed app will have different icon pattern than the icons of the pre-installed app. Therefore, Android O will have adaptive icons so that the icons of all apps will be either circular, with rounded corners, or flat rectangular depending on the launcher used.  Background Resource limit  The next version of android will aid in better battery life. One of the ways the system is optimizing battery consumption is by limiting background apps from waking up the resources. For instance, if a background app needs a location, the Android O won’t let it turn on the GPS but will feed with the last known location details instead. However, the app can easily get the full excess of the resources when it runs in the foreground.  Google Play Protect  The new security feature in Android O will check for apps in the phone for vulnerabilities and will notify accordingly.  Others:   The next version of android boots noticeably faster than the Nougat.  More control over notifications with snooze option for 15, 30 or 60minutes.  The settings app is now cleaner and shorter with a more organized look and feel.  Promised improvements in battery life, Bluetooth, and WiFi.   \xa0Android O Name Poll  Drop your votes on the possible name of Android O.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Android-O-new-features.png']

['HTC U11 is now official with Edge Sense!'],['HTC'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['May 16, 2017']",2017-05-16 12:02:12+00:00,"['Today is 5.16.2017, the date that has been long reserved by HTC as the announcement of its 2017 flagship, the HTC U11. Now, the HTC U11 is now official with  expected edge sense technology . If you are confused with this naming scheme from HTC. It is due to the fact that, this phone shares design language with HTC U-series smartphones and is a true successor to last year’s HTC 10. Let’s take a look at what new rival of Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 has to offer.  HTC U11: What’s Inside?   Before digging into the phone’s specifications, let’s talk about the design first. The phone comes with glossy and well-curved 3D glasses both on the front and the back. The glasses blend with the middle frame seamlessly. This liquid surface design of the phone has taken serious influence from the last HTC U-series phones. So, without a doubt, the HTC U11 is one of the best looking phones of the year.         The specs of the phone do match with the  rumors we shared  a couple of weeks ago. To\xa0mention, the phone comes with  5.5inch QuadHD Super LCD5 \xa0display protected with  3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5 . Like other flagships of 2017, the phone is powered by Qualcomm’s latest  SnapDragon 835 . \xa0On the memory side, it has  4GB RAM  and  64GB  expandable storage. However, another variant of the phone with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage will also be available but is region dependent. The company is claiming for the phone to provide great camera experience with  12Megapixel  Dual Pixel focusing camera unit on the back and  16 Megapixel  selfie camera that has been optimized for better low light performance. The phone runs on HTC sense UI based on  Android 7 Nougat . Power the device is the  3000mAh  battery that does support  Quick Charge 3.0  but no wireless charging.  HTC U11: Extra Offerings  The phone does come with few extras like 360 sound recording. Though the phone, with  HTC Usonic , has ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack, the noise canceling earphone comes inside the box of the phone. Plus, the company has packed USB Type C to 3.5mm converter as well. This noise canceling earphone doesn’t have a battery of itself but relies on the power of the phone. So,\xa0if you keep listening to the music for long using the earphone, the phone’s battery performance might suffer a little. There are some other highlighted extras that will be coming with this  IP67  water and dust resistant phone and they are:  Edge Sense   The most highlighted feature of the phone is its new Edge Sense Technology. The manufacturer has managed to place pressure sensors along the lower half of the phone’s edge that senses different pressure levels. How this works is,\xa0if you squeeze the phone then you can launch the camera or it could be any of your favorite apps. While in the camera app, you may give a quick squeeze to swap the camera in use and you can click a photo or selfie by long squeezing. These can be changed from the app named “Edge Sense” that will be available on the phone with its next update. HTC says the user can change the way they want to make use of this feature and this squeeze feature can be enabled to perform different functions even inside of the third party app.  Inclusion of both Microsoft Alexa and Google Assistant  The phones come with not just one but two AI assistants. Along with the Google Assistant, Microsoft Alexa can be enabled on the phone. Both the assistants will be active and the users may choose whichever they prefer. Additionally, the HTC’s own AI HTC Sense Companion will also reside peacefully along with those two other AI. Therefore, the phone doesn’t come with not two but  three AI assistants  in total.  Price and Availability:  HTC U11 has been priced at 649 USD and the phone is expected to go on sale from June at the earliest. But the phone’s availability in Nepal is\xa0still under a shadow. So, we’ll surely keep you updated on our future posts regarding its availability in Nepal.  Verdict:   Well, this Edge Sense technology that HTC is embracing in its flagship phone does seem to have some potentials. But its effectiveness depends on\xa0whether the users find it interesting and handy or not. So, it will be too early to judge the feature for now.\xa0However, the rest of the specs of the phone seem top notch. Plus, the refreshed design in HTC’s flagship is gaining praises worldwide. Hence, the phone can be considered as a possible rival to Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/htc-U11-price-in-nepal.png']

But, the leak of an entire phone lineup for a whole year is totally unexpected. But it has happened recently. Yes, I’m talking about the Motorola’s entire moto lineup for 2017 being leaked in an image. The image is making circles on the internet. And, this image looks to be authentic since it’s from a slideshow of an event. Based on the same image, here is the list of 9 upcoming Motorola phones with their leaked specs that’ll be released before the end of this year.  9 Upcoming Motorola Phones with Leaked Specs     Moto Z Lineup (Moto Z2 Force/Moto Z2 Play)  In moto Z lineup, this year there will be two devices and they are Moto Z(2) Play and Moto Z(2) Force. Like the Moto Z device last year, these devices will also be modular ones. They’ll support moto mods from last year. Most probably, few new moto mods might be coming this year as well. The Moto Z(2) Force will have 1GBps LTE modem and it hints at Qualcomm’s latest SnapDragon 835 powering the device. Plus, the device will come with a shattershield display like the Moto Z Force droid and the Droid turbo 2.   Moto X Lineup (Moto X4)  The Moto X phone this year wouldn’t be called Moto X 2017 but Moto X4 instead as per  the tweet of Evan Blass . The Moto X4 will have 5.2inch Full HD display with “3D Glass” which must be hinting at the remarkably curved glass. It is said to be coming with SmartCam and AI Integration. The more leaks of the device (IP68, metal body and more) can be solidified from the video below:          Moto g Lineup (Moto G5s/G5s Plus)  Moto G5 and G5 plus, arguably the best budget phones for 2017 are likely to an iteration within the same year from the release. Their iterations will be Moto G5s and G5s Plus. The noticeable upgrades from the outside in phones will be the screen size, the G5s will sport 5.2inch Full HD display whereas the G5Plus will have a bigger 5.5inch display. The plus model will be sporting dual cam setup as well. Another major change is likely to be on the processor used. The G5Plus is rumored to be coming with newer Snapdragon 630.   Moto e Lineup (Moto E4/E4 Plus)  Motorola\xa0is likely to introduce two newer models in its e Lineup (likely Moto e4 and e4Plus). These phones will sport the design language that seems to be influenced from that of moto g5. The cheapest among these two, the Moto e 2017, will have 5 inch HD display. And, the plus model will house a bigger battery with the capacity of 5000mAh.   Moto c Lineup (Moto C/Moto CPlus)  Motorola will bring new entry-level Moto phones in the very new lineup of Moto C. There will be two entry-level smartphones from Motorola this year. Both the devices will have a 5-inch screen but the moto c plus will have a bigger 4,000mAh battery.   Verdict:  Well, it’s good to know that new 9 Motorola devices are due this year.\xa0This leaked image look promising. It certainly has given an overview of what to expect from Motorola this year. But there is still a lot to get revealed about these upcoming 9 devices from Motorola. With time, we’ll certainly keep you updated with their future leaks and renders.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Moto-smartphones-2017-entire-lineup.png']

Well, it’s a smart watch. After the launch of Apple Watch in 2015, there has been a massive hype for smart watches. Today there are many smart watches out there that have LCD/OLED displays providing many extravagant features. They are equivalent to small phones on your wrist. Everyone does not fancy a smart watch. And if you’re like me who likes premium branded luxury watches then you’re are in luck.  Q series of Hybrid Watch:  Introducing Fossil’s Q series of hybrid watches. It’s with some features of a smartwatch. Fossil Q hybrid watches are basically analog looking watches with hidden smart watch facilities. The watch also has an activity dial that shows the percentage of the goal reached. Fossil also presents you with an app that connects with the watch. The app is available on both android and iOS. This app can be used for:   Activities tracing  Sleep monitoring  Setting custom activity goals  Alarms  Receiving notifications   All this works through the Bluetooth connection between the watch and the app. These notifications are something that the manufacturer has worked on extensively. Since the smart watch does not have a display, it is relayed through the vibration and movement of the watch dials.\xa0 You can program the dials of the watch to move in a certain combination that allows you to get notified that only you can understand. This makes your notification experience private. Talking about the battery life, it exceeds all smart watch battery life as it has a battery life of 6 months. Also, it has 2 separate batteries, i.e. for the analog watch and for the smart functionalities so that even if the smart watch’s battery runs out, the analog watch continues to function.        Verdict  Fossil Q hybrid smart watch is a simple yet ingenious product that combines an analog watch\xa0with an update of the 21st Century. The\xa0price of the watch starts from US $175 which is quite affordable for a luxury watch. The hybrid smart watch is a \xa0perfect balance between the elegance of a luxury mechanical watch and smartwatch functionality.

We put covers and protective glasses to prepare them for the worst cases. Truly, we don’t even get to enjoy the feel of the phone. So how about a phone that is truly durable, that can withstand all the mishaps that can happen in your daily life. Today we have the Leagoo M5 smartphone (Rs. 11,999) which comes with a shatterproof glass and claims to handle the worst beating possible. Let’s find out the  Leagoo M5 Review \xa0in this detailed analysis.\xa0  Leagoo M5 Specs:   5inch super HD IPS 2.5D Arc(shock proof &  Bulletproof  glass)  RAM-2GB, ROM-16GB(128GB Expandable)  FREEME OS6.0 (Android 6.0)   Processor-1.3GHz Quade core   Network-WCDMA/GSM   FINGER PRINT-0.19S Ultra fast   Camera-Rear 8MP with Flash/ front 5MP  Battery-2300mAh li-polymer\xa0  Price: Rs.11,999   Build:   Leagoo M5 \xa0is a decent looking phone that comes with a tough polycarbonate back. Its back cover has textured surface to it. The phone doesn’t have any premium feel whatsoever, it just feels chunky in the hand which is a good thing for a durable phone. \xa0        Display:   The phone comes with a 5-inch display with 2.5D shatterproof glass and capacitive navigation buttons which are not backlit.  The colors are a bit cool for my liking but it is good nonetheless and the viewing angles are great. The screen, however, is susceptible to oils and fingerprints which make it hard for the display to be visible in the direct sunlight.\xa0  The feature focus of the phone is the display itself. The company claims the phone comes with Military grade Bulletproof glass. We handled the phone roughly to test its durability. It could withstand drop from heights up to 6ft on our test. The display didn’t get any scratches or crack even with multiple drops on cement and marble but the front housing of the phone came off after few falls. \xa0You can even use it as a handy hammer so usual drops and mishaps are nothing to worry about. This sure is one heck of a tough phone.  Despite the thick glass, there is no issue with the touch sensitivity and you can smoothly use the device.  Performance :  The phone comes with a Quad Core Mediatek MT6580M processor clocked at 1.3Ghz and has 2GB of DDR3 RAM. You can multitask between 3 to 4 apps without any app restart. However, with heavy apps in the background, the phone starts to lag.   On the gaming front, you can play games on medium to high settings and there were few lags and stutters as I continued to play for a long time. I also felt heating near the camera section while gaming and heavy multitasking. All and all it’s a very decent performer that will get you through your day to day usage.  Software UI:   Leagoo M5 is running on Freeme OS Lite which is your typical Chinese OEM skin on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. There’s no app drawer, all the icons are on the home screen. The look of the UI is pretty basic, you don’t get playful icons like in the MIUI. There’s theme store for changing your icons and wallpapers but I don’t find most of them any good. I immediately opted for a custom launcher and icon pack after few hours of usage to deal with the phone’s ugly UI.  There’s a quick switch mode which performs the function of the lazy swipe app. You can access by swiping from the edges. You also have off-screen gestures like double tap to wake up and control music. \xa0M5 comes with a fingerprint sensor on the back, which takes a lot of time to setup but unlocks the phone fairly fast.  Camera:   Leagoo M5 comes with an 8MP rear camera and 5MP front facing camera. \xa0The rear camera is decent, images looks good during daylight but they pretty much lack details. You can get decent images if the lighting is really good. And in low light, images are washed out and have lots of grain in them.  The rear camera is decent, images looks good during daylight but they pretty much lack details. You can get decent images if the lighting is really good. And in low light, images are washed out and have lots of grain in them.  The front camera is also decent, photos lack details and look washed out. The camera is definitely not a good part of this phone.   Battery :   The M5 comes with 2300 mAh battery which didn’t last for long during my usage. I got around 2 and a half hours of screen on time most of the days which is pretty low. You need to carry your charger if you want this thing to last until the end of the day. it takes around 2 hours to charge the phone.   Verdict :   So, for Rs.12,000, you cannot ask for a tougher and a decently specced\xa0entry level android phone. There are a lot of things to love and at the same time a lot to hate about the phone.The good things about the phone are:  The good things about the phone are:   A bulletproof display making it one of the toughest phone out there.  A good 720P screen.\xa0  Decent performance for your daily usual stuff.   And what I don’t like about the phone is    Poor camera quality.  Subpar battery life despite low-powered hardware configuration.

The Google Taimen is yet another pixel device for which the rumors claim to be a phone with the display bigger than the pixel XL. So will it be a pixel XXL or rather will be a tablet? This is a\xa0question that is bugging minds worldwide. Recently, the Google taimen was spotted on the Geekbench with 4GB RAM and Android O.  Google Taimen Geekbench Scores   This Geekbench information doesn’t have much to spare. Let’s talk about the scores first. The single core score of 1804 and multi-core score of 6248 are considerably good scores, but not the best though. These scores are comparable to that of S8+ since S8+ scored 1929 and 6084 on Geekbench for single core and multi-core tests. So, it’s likely the last rumor of all pixel devices to run on Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 might be true. However, the CPU is clocked at 1.9GHz only. So, it might be underclocked SD 835 or a midrange processor like SD 653 (less likely). What we are certain about this next pixel device from google codenamed “Taimen” is it’ll have 4GB RAM and will run on Android O.

Abroad study, as fascinating as it sounds, however, is not easy at all. There will be certain tests/exams (like GRE, GMAT, IELTS, SAT and GMAT) one need to attend to and attain the prerequisite score or more than it. To attain remarkable score, one should have a sound knowledge of English vocabulary, grammar, and its comprehensive use. The preparation is troublesome in most cases for not finding the resources required. However, with GIST app on your phone, the preparation will not be that troubling.  GIST, by its name, stands as an acronym for GRE, GMAT, IELTS, SAT and TOEFL. The GIST app is developed by Fewasoft with the sole purpose to ease the preparation for GIST exams.  GIST App: What is inside?  The app opens up to display clean and easy user interface. The GIST app is sectionalized into four segments, viz.  Learn & Remember ,  Vocab in Context ,  Test Your Limits  and  Random, or is it?.        Learn & Remember  As the name implies, this segment is all about learning and remembering words, phrases, and idioms. This segment consists of 50 sets of regular vocabulary and two additional sets as a bonus making it a total of 52 sets. Each set of vocabulary includes 25 words, phrases/idioms with meanings and a suitable use of it in a sentence. The meanings are provided in English and Nepali; however, to enable the meaning in Nepali feature, one should Choose Regional Language as Nepali from the setting lying on the top right corner of the app.  The words,\xa0phrases or idioms on the Learn and remember section can be opted as “I Know” and “I Don’t Know”. With the use of a certain algorithm and according to the behavior of the user, the app distinguishes the expertise of user on those words, phrases, and idioms and keeps track of it showing on the top of each set.  Vocab in Context  This section includes articles from different newspapers and magazines. This section is used is give the users clear insights of on the comprehensive use of learned vocabulary.  Test Your Limits  This section is subdivided into three types of tests,  Quick Test – On the Go ,  Donkey’s years  and  choose correct answer . This test includes the words from both locked and unlocked sets.   Quick Test – On the Go:  – This test presents the words with five words to test the vocabulary built. At the end, the users are rewarded with a star for each word known and an expressive emoticon for the result.  Donkey’s Years:  – The name for the test seems weird and somewhat irrelevant. Probably an increased number of words for the test could be an answer. This test is similar to Quick Test, the only difference being the set of 25 words.  Choose Correct Answer : – This is an MCQ-type test for those who find it easier to learn with options handy. An option can be selecting by double-tapping it. For any incorrect option selected, the option disappears encouraging the users to try again with remaining more probable options.   Random, or is it?  This section helps the users to avoid common mistakes one can make during the test. The spelling and use in the context of certain confusing words are mentioned in this section. It also includes rules for writing sections of GRE, GMAT, IELTS, SAT and TOEFL exams.  Some more features of GIST App   The most striking feature of this app is that it does not include any ads plus the GIST app is free to download.  The app is made more playful with just five sets unlocked at first. The new sets get unlocked as the user gets expert on the words of previous sets.  Turning on the sound lets you hear the pronunciations of the words.  GIST app includes all the frequent words of GRE, GMAT, IELTS, SAT and TOEFL.   Verdict  I find the app very useful for GIST preparators. The clean and easy UI will be the first benefit for the users. The simple and concise meaning to the words in the app helps the users to learn the words quickly and the Nepali meanings for the words have definitely been a privilege for the Nepali users. The GIST app also includes TTS (Text-to-Speech) due to which the app speaks the words itself telling users the pronunciation of the words. So, owing to its capability, I personally think it is the must have app for GIST preparators. For its ease of use and simplified learning and remembering methodology, this app will also be of use to the ones, who ought to develop their English vocabulary.

['A new tool to generate stronger passwords using AI'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['May 10, 2017']",2017-05-10 11:42:04+00:00,"['Just think about your password or group of passwords you use for a second. Are they any good? Or are they just simple word or phrases that you can remember easily? Remember those scenes from films or TV series you watch, where a person is trying to figure out the password of the other person. The hacker then suddenly remembers that one key feature about that person and types in that password and gets into the computer. Well, this can happen if you don’t choose your passwords carefully. The threat that the password of a student to be cracked might not be that much but if you’re an employee of a corporation where your password might be a gateway to all of your important information and bank accounts, there is a high probability that this might happen.  New Tool:  Well, there is an ingenious tool developed by a team from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Chicago that provides constructive suggestion to the user to change various parts of the password to make it more secure. The main core of this tool implements AI as a part of its thinking process specifically artificial neural network as that of our brain. This tool, instead of just showing the boring old “how strong your your password is” like they display in all major email service providers, tells you that a portion of your password needs change  The team developed this tool by feeding it with more than 135 million passwords and over 10 million natural-language words. For this reason, this tool can tell you whether the password you typed has been used before and can warn you not to use it again. Once the users begin typing in a password, the tool will indicate what requirements have been met and and also parts that need significant correction to create a strong password. At the end of the day, it depends on the user to accept or disregard the suggestion made by the tool.         Also Read:  WORST PASSWORDS OF 2016 [ INCLUDING TIPS FOR STRONG PASSWORDS ] \xa0  Verdict:  I think this is a brilliant tool that helps us as a user to improve the strength of our passwords and is clearly better than the one that just shows how strong the typed password is. However, there is one thing that bugs me about an AI giving me tips to change my password as if it is trying to manipulate me into shaping my password according to its opinion. There’s a high probability of critical information getting into the wrong hands. However, if you are not sure on how you can improve the strength of your password this can surely help you.

We praise the manufacturers for thinking about their customers and including a battery that could last 2 or even 3 days in total. But what if a manufacturer came up with a smartphone whose battery could last a whopping 15 days in total? Well, the day we can witness this may not be far as Oukitel, a smartphone manufacturer from Shenzhen, China, is set to launch a smartphone with 10,000 mAh battery next this June.  The Oukitel K10000 Pro isn’t the first smartphone from the company to feature such a massive battery. It had previously launched the  Oukitel K10000 back in December 2015 . And using the slogan ‘To Be the King’, the manufacturer is set to launch another beast of a device again.  Specification wise, the Oukitel K10000 Pro will sport a 5.5-inch display with the resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. The display will wear a version of Corning Gorilla Glass which the company hasn’t mentioned yet. Under the hood, it will run on a 1.5 GHz Octa-core MediaTek MT6750 processor which will be coupled with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.        Oukitel is yet to disclose other specifications and the price tag of the device. Whatever the price tag is, the fact that it will house a 10,000 mAh battery is more than impressive. But how long will it take to charge this battery completely? Oukitel has said that the K10000 pro will come with a 12V/2A flash charger which is capable of charging the battery in about 3 hours.  The fact that it has such a huge battery means that the Oukitel K10000 pro will have a heft to it. The device will weigh 292.5 gram. In comparison, the  Samsung Galaxy S8  weighs 155 gram whereas the  iPhone 7  weighs 138 gram.  So what do you think about the Oukitel K10000 pro? Are you interested in buying this device?

That WiFi certification didn’t share much other than the phone will be running on Android 7 Nougat. But the latest leak of the phone reveals all of its Specs. The Galaxy J7 2017 recently got spotted in GFXBench as “SM-J730” and here’s everything you need to know about the phone.  Samsung Galaxy J7 2017: Specs Revealed on GFXBench   The next iteration of J7 will have noticeable upgrades as compared to last years J7 and the one before that. The screen size of  5.5ich  is same as those two J7 but will have a greater resolution of  1920*1080 pixels . The phone will be running on the latest  Android 7.0 Nougat . It will be powered by\xa0 Exynos 7870 , an Octa-core CPU clocked at 1.5GHz. Another upgrade the phone will be having is in the RAM department since it’ll have a  3GB RAM .

['General Mobile GM 5 Plus Review: Best Android One Phone?'],['Reviews'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['May 8, 2017']",2017-05-08 13:12:26+00:00,"['When it comes to an Android One device, what we recall is a cheap smartphone that does provide pure android experience but fails to impress us with its hardware. But, the newly introduced Android One Phone in Nepal, the GM 5Plus that is designed by General Mobile is a little different. This phone doesn’t just come with pure android Nougat sweetness but also sports competitive specs in the price range. So, should you really buy this Android One phone priced at Rs. 25,000? Let’s find out.  Key Specs of General Mobile GM 5 Plus:   5.5″ IPS LTPS Full HD (1080×1920 pixels) Display  Corning Gorilla Glass 4  Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 Octa-Core 64 Bit  3GB LPDDR3 RAM  32GB Storage (expandable up to 128GB)  Rear Camera: 13MP AF with Dual Led Flash  Selfie Camera: 13MP AF with Front Flash  Li-Po 3100mAh Battery  Type-C connector, GM Turbo Charger  Hybrid Dual SIM tray  Android 7 Nougat (upgradable to 7.1.1)   Design   The GM 5 Plus, looks attractive from the front and the side but the same cannot be said about the back. The slim chamfered metal frame makes the device look slimmer than it really is. The buttons are also made out of metal and the power button is easy to spot with its dotted texture. The polycarbonate back kind of looks cheap and outdated. The camera bump and huge General Mobile branding make the device look even uglier.\xa0 But when it comes to holding the phone, the phone does provide a good grip.        Display   The 5.5inch Full HD display used in this phone is a good one. The color reproduction is near perfect and the viewing angles are wide too. The best thing about the display is the great outdoor visibility it has. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4. After 2 weeks of use as my daily driver, there are very few faint scratches on it. I used the phone for hours at night by setting the brightness to its minimum and surprisingly I didn’t feel any eye burning.  Performance  The phone powered by Snapdragon 617 that is coupled with 3GB of RAM is powerful enough to be used as a daily driver. The apps load pretty fast. The display touch is pretty responsive. I could switch between the apps with an ease. The phone doesn’t heat much but when I used the phone’s camera while charging the phone’s frame got warmer. The loudspeaker on the bottom is pretty loud and so is the earpiece. The earphone that comes with the phone is of good quality as well. During the time of my review, both the data and WiFi connections were stable and I didn’t experience any call drops.  On the memory side, it has 32GB of internal storage. In case it’s insufficient, the phone supports a microSD card of up to 128GB. Like other phones with hybrid SIM tray, the card is gonna use your SIM2 slot.  Camera   The phone has 13Megapixel autofocus camera units both on the front and the back. The primary camera is accompanied with dual led flash and the front too has got a LED flash for taking selfies in under-lit conditions. The photos taken under ideal lighting conditions come out sharp and well detailed. The color reproduction on photos is well okay. But, If you want to take photos with more vibrant colors, you can do so by turning the HDR on. The regular selfies are well detailed but come with a darker skin tone so I personally preferred the selfies taken with HDR on. The phone can shoot Full HD videos both from the front and the back. So, I found the cameras in this phone to be on par with the pricing.        1  of 12               Indoor Photo Sample         Macro Sample         Selfie Sample         Selfie with HDR on         Primary Camera Portrait Sample (HDR)         Rear Camera Food Photo Sample         Rear Camera Sample (Day Time)         GM 5 Plus Photo Sample         Rear Camera Sample (HDR)         Low Light Photo Sample         Primary Camera Sample         Random street Photo Sample                                                Software  This is an Android One phone so software is the best part about this phone. It comes with the Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box and after the latest update, it’s running on Android 7.1.1 with Security Patch of April 2017. You can easily access the Google assistant by long pressing the home button. The Google launcher is simple and keeps four of the most used apps on the top of the app drawer. What I liked the most about this version of android is the grouping of the notification it does and the option of quick reply straight from the notifications of messaging apps.      GM 5 Plus UI (ScreenShots)   1  of 9                                                                                                            Battery  The GM 5Plus comes with a 3100 mAh battery and the battery performance of the phone is well, average. Once fully charged, I got around 3 to 4 hours of screen on time in normal usage. In case you run low on power, the GM Turbo charger with quick charge 3.0 will get you covered. Though the phone has been advised to get 60% charge in 30minutes, the unit I tested gave a surprising result of only 33% of charge in 30minutes. It took a little under 2 hours to fully charge the phone. The phone is the one with USB type-c but however, you may still borrow your friends microUSB type-B charger if you’re carrying the microUSB to Type-c connector that comes with the phone.      General Mobile GM 5 Plus Battery Performance   1  of 4                                                          Verdict  The GM 5 Plus, the android One phone that was initially released a year ago in Turkey still seems to be worth buying if the pure android experience is what you’re after. \xa0So during my period of review, these are the things I liked and disliked about the General Mobile GM 5 Plus.      General Mobile GM 5 Plus Gallery   1  of 5                                                                    WHAT I LIKED ABOUT GENERAL MOBILE GM5 PLUS:   The phone runs on the latest version of Android and timely gets the latest android security patches. So, the stock android is minimalistic, responsive and snappy.  The phone has a great display and this display is arguably the best display used in any phones of this price range.  The cameras (both the front and the back) are equally impressive. The camera performance of the phone is on par with its pricing.   WHAT I DISLIKED ABOUT\xa0 GENERAL MOBILE GM5 PLUS   The phone lacks a fingerprint sensor that has almost become a ‘must-have’ feature in a smartphone recently.  The phone’s battery isn’t as optimized as I expected for a phone running on stock android.  The black borders around the screen of the phone are so thick that I can’t get my eyes off them every time I look into the screen.   \xa0  ALSO READ:\xa0 TOP PHONES UNDER RS. 30,000']",[]

But, the GamePad Digital (GPD), a Chinese\xa0company\xa0is mass producing a tiny laptop after  fundraising over $3million dollars in an IndieGoGo campaign . This GPD Pocket is even smaller than the smaller laptops that we’ve been seeing. The 7-inch screen laptop, is indeed small but still, comes with\xa0worth-mentioning specs.  GPD Pocket:\xa0Everything You Need to Know  GPD Pocket comes with a 7inch touchscreen Retina Display that sports a resolution of 1920*1200 resulting in odd 16:10 aspect ratio. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. This tiny laptop is powered by\xa0Intel Atom x7-Z8700 processor and has 4GB of RAM. It boots on\xa0Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or Windows 10 Home. It is 480 grams heavy and 18.5mm thick. The housing is stylish yet sturdy since it’s\xa0CNC precise all-in-one body made of magnesium and alloy. So, this tiny little thing is just as good-looking as the Apple Macbook Air or Microsoft Surface 3. As far as the ports are concerned, it has a USB 3.0, USB-C, mini HDMI and 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead of a trackpad, this laptop comes with a mouse knob like the one in older dell and Lenovo laptops. It has Bluetooth for connecting BT mouse and headphones. The company claims that the laptop will give 12hours of battery life off a charge.  Pricing and Availability:  The GPD has already closed its Indiegogo campaign, so you can’t be a backer and can’t pre-order the device. However, the device is expected to go on Sale in the US starting from June 15. The device can be bought from Indiegogo at the price of $399.\xa0Whereas, those buying from an offline retail store will have to pay $599.         Verdict:  Well, this small laptop from GPD seems impressive. Despite its small dimensions, it is still feature-rich and has the configuration that is comparable to Apple Macbook Air and Microsoft Surface 3. As far as my personal opinion is concerned, the laptop has been made tinier than it should be. So this tiny laptop with a tiny keyboard wouldn’t be a right one for me to write my stuff on the go. Well, that could be just me and you might be interested in buying a tiny laptop that you can carry around in your pocket.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GPD-Pocket-Laptop-Specs-Price-Features-in-Nepal.png']
['Hidden truth behind the Captcha'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['May 8, 2017']",2017-05-08 08:16:55+00:00,"['We all have come across these boxes with distorted letters and asked upon to retype those displayed letters in a text box. These tests are called CAPTCHA which stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. In artificial intelligence, Turing test is a test for intelligence in a computer. This test is done to check if a human can distinguish a computer from a human using the replies to questions put to both.  How it all started  CAPTCHA were created in the early days of internet to prevent the access of web content by automated pieces of codes. These code could damage the integrity of the website. The whole point of these tests is to prevent SPAM on the internet. It also\xa0stops automated programs from making online purchases like all the tickets of a well awaited concert or an event to prevent the sale of the tickets in black market.  CAPTCHA has become a universal tool and an accepted part of the internet user experience. Millions of people on the internet input these CAPTCHA on a daily basis. Some companies in developing countries have taken this phenomenon as a business opportunity. These companies basically let low wage workers solve these CAPTCHA on behalf of others. They may be people such as the visually impaired or to the companies interested in advertisement.        Evolution to reCAPTCHA  Millions of people were voluntarily translating nonsensical images into text. This seemed to the creators of CAPTCHA as waste of free labor. This led to the birth of reCAPTCHA which utilized this man power to solve words rather than random letters. The creators decided to digitize all books by scanning the pages of the book. It led to the utilization of\xa0optical character recognition software to translate the words to digital text. Any word that was not correctly recognized by the software was uploaded as reCAPTCHA.  Any reCAPTCHA that was typed as the same word for the text image shown multiple times, the word would be confirmed as the text and uploaded to the eBook database. Due to this effort hundred million reCAPTCHAs were solved per day. This rate led to digitization of two and a half million books every year. Google then acquired reCAPTCHA in 2009 to digitize all their Google books. Also they used it to digitize street sign from Google street view to label Google maps.  Birth of noCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA  As the advancement in image recognition grew, CAPTCHA were no more a barrier for bot. As CAPTCHA were made more and more difficult, a 2014 Google analysis found that artificial intelligence could crack even the most complex CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA images with 99.8 percent accuracy where as the humans could not even solve a CAPTCHA with 50 percent accuracy. Google then launched the now familiar “I’m not a robot” checkbox know as the noCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA. While it may appear to the user as a simple task, the program in the background analyzes things like the IP addresses, cookies of the user’s web activities and event the user’s mouse movement as it hovers and approaches a checkbox.  This method can pretty much distinguish a human from a bot. If the program is still not sure, a set of challenges are presented to the uses which are based on multiple image recognition problems.Google will then remember the next time the user checks a noCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA. ‘noCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA’ means no frustration, let people go where they are going faster and keep the bots at bay.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/truth-behind-captcha.png']
['Everything You need to know about New Windows 10 S'],['Windows'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['May 7, 2017']",2017-05-07 16:26:51+00:00,"['Recently, Microsoft released a new version of Windows 10 called the 10s. By name, it sounds like a new update to your current windows but it’s an operating system with a completely different concept. If you have heard about the Windows 10 S but don’t know what it is and what sets it apart from the regular Windows 10 then here’s your answer:   What is Windows 10 S?    Windows 10 S is the trimmed down version of the Windows 10 Pro which is designed to run on low-powered hardware computers. The new OS is made to compete directly with the lightweight laptop operating systems like the Chrome OS that is taking the industry by storm. A lightweight OS means, it can run on a very cheap hardware and provide optimum performance and battery life. Windows 10 S is targeted for students and business who prefer security and performance. The ‘S’ in the name is streamlined for  simplicity, security, and speed.  If you’re running Windows 10 then it can also run the 10 S.  Apps from Windows Store Only:         Your applications are delivered via the Windows Store ensuring Microsoft-verified security and integrity.  You cannot just run a  .exe  file to install third-party software on the 10 S. This means you don’t have Chrome, iTunes or any Adobe products on your computer. Microsoft does allow developers to port their apps to the store but it may take some time to really see some popular third party apps on the store.   Default Apps:  Source: Windows Central  With Windows 10 S Microsoft is locking down users on the Windows ecosystem. The default browser on the OS will be  Microsoft Edge  which you cannot switch despite installing other browsers from the store. Also, whichever browser you use,  Bing  will be default search engine which you cannot change.  Security, Performance and Battery Life:   By limiting apps to those in the Windows Store, Windows 10 S is ideal for people who have everything they need in the Windows Store and prefer the peace of mind that comes with removing the risk of downloading apps from other places. As a trimmed down version of the Windows 10, the 10 S is optimized for maximum performance. As Microsoft demonstrated on their Surface Laptop, it boots up in just 15 seconds.   The lite software and minimum use of hardware resources ultimately result in less battery consumption. Microsoft promises the best battery life out of the 10 S. With the Surface Laptop, MS assures it will provide backup for 14 Hours which is a pretty bold claim.   Bottomline:  Windows 10 S  is not for everyone, it is targeted specifically for students and schools, where on a limited environment one can assure productivity, security, stability, and affordability. The operating system is not completely restrictive, you have all the core functionalities of the system intact. \xa0If you are a professional then it is definitely not the right operating system for you. But if you happen to buy a laptop running 10 S, it can be easily upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for $49 from Windows store. But until this year, for every 10 S user, there’s free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.   All the major laptop manufacturers like Acer, Dell and Lenovo will be bringing out their own series of laptop running Windows10 S, later this summer.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Windows-10-S-GadgetbyteNepal.png']
"['India Launches SAARC Satellite, A big step for Nepal as well?']",[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['May 7, 2017']",2017-05-07 06:30:01+00:00,"['India launched their GSAT-9 Satellite on May 5 th  2017 by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region. It is basically a communications and meteorology satellite. This plan was put forward by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, of a satellite that serves the needs of SAARC member nations in the 18 th  SAARC submit held in Nepal in 2014.  What is a communication satellite?  Well a communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals. It creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. These satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet applications. There are over 2,000 communications satellites in Earth’s orbit of which the SAARC satellite will be one of them. Like every other machine, satellites do not last for ever. However the mission duration is estimated to be 12 years.  The SAARC satellite basically has a geostationary orbit (GEO). It orbits the Earth at an altitude of 35,786 kilometers which is about 35 times the length of the east west highway. It orbits around the earth once every 24 hours which is similar to the earth’s rotation about its axis. This means that the satellite will appear stationary to all the observer from the earth. This Satellite is specifically for TV broadcasting and telephone communication as the satellite dishes pointing toward this GEO satellite will never have to change the position. This GEO satellite is at such high altitude and has uninterrupted view of a large area of the earth. It is therefore also used for monitoring the weather and climate of the Indian Ocean.        Will it be beneficial for us?   As stated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the satellite focuses on enabling:   full range of applications and services in the areas of telecommunication  broadcasting applications viz television (TV)  direct-to-home (DTH)  very small aperture terminals (VSATs)  tele-education and tele-medicine  disaster management support   The launch of SAARC GSAT-9 satellite is an excellent multi-dimensional facility that is currently at our disposal. This has led to the decrease in dependency of Nepal to other foreign satellite. Nepal can now rely on its own SAARC satellite for communication with the world. However, it depends on how the Government of Nepal is going to utilize its new resource.\xa0 Do you think this is a big step for communication development in our country? Will it help to improve the rural communication\xa0infrastructure of Nepal? Well this is a question that only time can answer.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SAARC-Satellite.png']

However, because of its CGT controversy, it has been brutally criticized and even boycotted from several groups. Some law experts of the country also had maintained stress on the government to restrict the expansion of any new services from Ncell till all the government taxes get cleared. Despite the pressure, Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) has approved the permission to add 4G services in the portfolio of Ncell services.  The service will launch on the first day of June .   4G service was launched by NTC in the New Year 2017 . Though the service is limited to Kathmandu valley and Pokhara, there are more than six million 4G users in Nepal. Since the launch of 4G service by NTC, Ncell had been making an appeal to NTA to provide 4G services to its users. However, because of the CGT controversy and the pressure developed from it, Ncell had not been able to operate 4G services. Ncell now has been able to expand 4G services because of the Technology Neutrality mentioned on the Frequency Policy of 2016. Ncell now can operate its 4G services starting from June 1. It will use the same frequency (i.e. 1800 MHz) as used by the NTC 4G. The private company has also been granted to use 800 MHz and 900 Mhz frequency to serve high-speed internet.  The first phase of the service will be dedicated to Kathmandu valley, Pokhara, and Damauli. The services will be then expanded to Biratnagar, Bhairahawa, and Butwal.        What is 4G?  4G is the fourth generation in telecommunication technology. It is more than two times faster than 3G. Theoretically, the speed of 4G is 100 Mbps. But the 4G service provided by NTC is quite slow to that level and is limited around 30 Mbps. The speed of Ncell 4G has not been disclosed yet.

Ltd., the authorized distributor of OPPO Mobiles in Nepal, has launched OPPO F3 smartphone in a star-studded event in Yak and Yeti Hotel. The Oppo F3 was launched for Rs. 35,490. However, the phone\xa0has received a  price cut of Rs. 2,500  and is now available for  Rs. 31,590.  The OPPO F3 is also available in Black color option apart from the Gold color option.  OPPO F3 is a cheaper variant to the recently launched  OPPO F3 Plus  (Rs. 54,900). It houses a full metal body and a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with a\xa0full HD resolution. The display is protected by the latest Gorilla Glass 5. Powering the phone is an octacore MediaTek processor (MT6750T, 1.5Ghz, 64bit, Cortex A53) and 4GB RAM. Storage is 64GB, but you can expand it via microSD for upto 64GB.         The OPPO F3 justifies the tagline “Selfie Expert” as it boasts a dual front camera (16MP + 8MP). The 16MP camera is for taking high-resolution portrait selfie while the 8MP is for taking group selfies.\xa0The rear camera is a 13MP shooter. Backing up the device is a 3200mAh battery, but it lacks fast charging.   Connectivity wise, it has dual SIM card slot with both SIM support 4G LTE. There’s also WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS. The fingerprint sensor is located on the front.

At Rs. 32,990, the OPPO F3 is\xa0an interesting phone. It has a good 1080P display which is standard for phones at this price bracket, 4GB RAM and 64GB storage is good to see in a mid-range phone, the dual front camera is best in its league, and the phone looks gorgeous all thanks to its uni metal construction.  The biggest letdown of the OPPO F3 is an average MediaTek processor which can be found in a sub 20,000 smartphone these days. Even with 4GB of RAM, the phone suffers while playing high-end games and is not ideal for heavy multitasking. Phones like Xioami Mi A1 (Rs. 30,000), Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Rs. 25,000) performs better than the OPPO F3.   The second letdown is it’s still running on Android Marshmallow 6.0 and the UI is heavily skinned and hence will take a time to get Nougat. Phones launching in 2017 should really have Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Gionee A1 has one and the Huawei GR5 2017 recently got the update as well. So, what are your thoughts on the Oppo F3?

['Apex Smart Diary Review: Is it really smart?'],['Reviews'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['May 6, 2017']",2017-05-06 04:21:20+00:00,"['Apex Digital, a subsidiary of the Apex Group is making a name for itself in the Nepali market because of its smart store. The store has opened up various  branches all over Nepal  in a very short time. It has started to shine because of the on-hand experience with smartphones of various brands that it offers to its customers. And while Apex Digital has been working with smartphones for some time now, the store has recently introduced a new self-designed diary-cum-gadget into the Nepali tech market.  Named ‘Smart Diary’, the diary does justice to its name. It comes with a power bank, few charging cables, a flash drive, and more importantly, papers for writing. It allows three options in terms of colors: black, green and pink, and each color has a different texture on its cover. The black one I got to use has a smooth covering, the green one has a rough texture and the pink one has a mixture of both textures. Apex Digital has priced the Smart Diary at Rs. 3,999.         The smart diary is clothed by a leather-like material on the outside with padding on the inside, which makes it comfortable to hold and carry around. It can be opened with a magnetic clip that has a flash drive which slides out easily.  The interior, however, is not very different from a normal diary. The first few pages consist of personal memoranda, emergency numbers, and a calendar for the year 2017. This is followed by normal diary pages.   It is the final page of the diary that one encounters the genuinely ‘smart’ aspect of it and brings us to the major feature of the Smart Diary. Inside the outer covering is a power bank of capacity 10,000 mAh. Three cables, one for power input interface, another for a microUSB cable and a thunderbolt cable sit comfortably on the outer covering of the power bank. The battery life of the power bank is indicated by four LED lights present on the inner covering. These lights are accompanied by a power switch.   Using the microUSB cable, I had no issues with the battery pack. However, when I tried to charge the iPhone 6 Plus through the thunderbolt cable, I couldn’t really juice up its battery. Instead, the charge of the device actually started to decrease.  The diary’s flash drive is of 8 GB. It works without any hiccups and I liked the fact that Apex Digital has cleverly kept the drive inside the diary’s magnetic clip. But since the flash drive is surrounded by magnets on all sides, what if it stops working? Since I got to use the Smart Diary only for a short time, I couldn’t find any conclusive answers to the question.   Cons   Well, like I already mentioned, the major con of the Smart Diary is the fact that the flash drive could get damaged because of the magnet. Also, what’s the use of having a power bank and a thunderbolt cable if you can’t really charge an iPhone?  The Smart Diary also lacks a USB Type-C connector. And with more and more phones coming out with the feature, Apex Digital should have included the connector.  Who is it for?  No doubt the Smart Diary features some neatly included individual gadgets and pieces of technology. But is it for everyone? Perhaps not.   So who is it really for? If you work and carry around individual cables and power bank, then this is a perfect diary for you as it was for me.When I used the device, I didn’t have to carry around any other cables and power banks which, for me, were always annoying. Furthermore, I also didn’t have to carry an extra notebook. Oh, and Apex Digital will refill the papers if you fill it all up, but after you pay for it, of course.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Smart-Diary-2-1.jpg']

But there are some notable changes to the hardware of the phone. Looking at the render it looks like \xa0Huawei has ditched the headphone jack on the phone as only the USB C port lies on the bottom and the top is completely clean. With the headphone jack removed, leakers have speculated that the new phone might come with some sort of water resistance.\xa0The fingerprint sensor has been relocated\xa0from the back to the front of the phone.

['Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier Review: Best Smartwatch to Buy?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartwatch Price in Nepal']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['May 3, 2017']",2017-05-03 14:28:33+00:00,"['Smart Watches are a rare thing in tech when it comes to Nepal. But still, we have few options available in the market. Their rise to popularity, obviously, has been hindered by their price tag, as they do not come any cheap. But if the price is not the concern and if you have to pick one, then the Galaxy S3 Frontier is the option you’d want to go for. Let’s find out what you can get out of a Rs.40,000 smartwatch.\xa0  Build and Design   The Galaxy S3 Frontier is aesthetically pleasing and feels sturdy. It comes with a 1.3inch Super AMOLED display which is really sharp and protected by Corning Gorilla Glass SR. The watch as a whole is IP68 water and dust resistance so you have nothing to worry about. It feels really solid and even with few drops and strikes here and there, I couldn’t find any physical damage on the watch. The fair and simple design of the watch makes it look like any other normal watch. The back of the watch comes with stainless steel and on the right side, it comes with two physical buttons. The upper button is used as a back button and the lower button is the home button which can be programmed for double tap feature. You can use the double tap to show the recent apps, enable S Voice, start S Health and so on.\xa0          One of the most pleasing aspects of the watch is the circular dial which makes navigating around the watch much faster and easier. You can spend hours just playing with the dialer. There are also few games on the Samsung App Store which you can play on this watch with the help of the dial. The watch is 12.9mm thick but doesn’t feel that big and the straps are 22m wide which felt pretty comfortable during my daily use.  Software  The watch is running on Samsung’s Tizen OS with 768MB RAM and 4GB storage.\xa0I noticed no lag during my usage even with loads of watch faces installed and apps running in the background.\xa0You need a companion Gear App and other Samsung Apps installed on your phone to connect it to the watch. All of your notifications and calendar events are synced to Gear seamlessly. You can also sync music and pictures. You can make a call, send SMS, reply to various app from the watch itself. There’s T9 keyboard on the watch for typing, or you can use the circular dialer to choose the default replies or just use the emojis.\xa0  You have plenty of watch faces to choose from, on the Samsung App store you can find all sorts of watch faces that suit your mood and style. It feels like wearing a new watch every single time changing the watch face.  Health Tracking   The watch proves to be more useful when used for fitness tracking. With the Samsung’s S Health app, the Gear can track pretty much everything you’re doing and provide insights on that. If you are working out, playing Golf, climbing stairs, running, walking, or sitting idle for too long, the watch will give you insights on all of your activities which you can check both on your watch and the S Health app on your phone. You also have heart rate sensor which seems to be pretty accurate. Apart from that, you have Altimeter, Barometer, and GPS.\xa0  The 380mAh battery seems to be pretty solid as it gave two to three days of battery backup depending on the usage and with the use of dark watch face. It takes two hours to fully charge the watch.  Verdict   With very few app support, the Tizen OS proves to be a drawback. With Android Wear 2.0 you could have a plenty of android apps right on your wrist but that’s not the same with Tizen OS. There are only a handful of useful apps on Samsung App Store and it feels like a restriction from using your watch to its full potential.\xa0  The goal of wearable is obviously to sync your notifications and track your health, and S3 frontier just does that in the best way possible. If you can live with limited apps on your wrist and  if you just want a solid smartwatch that can last for days and track your health in the most detailed way possible. Then this is worth the buy. It’s definitely not cheap but it can help you in your daily tasks in a great way.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Galaxy-Gear-S3-Frontier-Nepal-GB.jpg']

The HTC’s flagship for this year will be the HTC U 11. It will be the successor to last year’s HTC 10 but will be packing something unique with it. I don’t wanna keep much of suspense that something unique is the frame with “Edge Sense” that the phone will be having. Such frame design will sense the different pressure levels on the frame and will function accordingly. This can be solidified with the latest teaser video of the phone by the HTC. If you haven’t checked that teaser already, you may check it here:   Release Date:  Now the release date of the phone is official and it is on  May 16, 2017 . In case you’re counting the days left, it’s just 18 days away from now.        HTC U 11: Rumored Specs:  Though the release date isn’t that far, but still we can understand your urge of knowing the specs beforehand. That’s why we’ve tried compiling the rumored specs of the phone. The design of the phone will be somewhat similar to the HTC U ultra with shiny back and everything. But it’ll be distinct because of its touch-sensitive\xa0frame called the “ Edge Sense “. The phone won’t have any secondary display or anything and is likely to come with a  5.5inch QuadHD display \xa0with sapphire\xa0glass protection. It’s still not sure whether it’ll be an LCD or AMOLED one.  The HTTC U 11 will be powered by  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835  and will be coupled with  4GB  RAM. The phone will have onboard storage of  64/128 GB . This memory will be expandable up to 256GB. The phone will have a  12Megapixel unit on the back  that will have OIS and will shoot 4K@30fps. For the front, mixed rumors are being heard. Neglecting the rumor of 8MP selfie unit, I believe it to be the  16MP selfie unit  just like the one in HTC U Ultra. As far as the battery’s concerned, it will at least be of  3000mAh\xa0 but we’d love to see something above that for a 5.5inch 1440p display. The phone will run on  Android 7 Nougat  with HTC Sense on top of it.  The phone will have capacitive buttons on either side of the fingerprint sensor that doubles as a home button. Just like the HTC U Ultra, the phone will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack. The rumor claims the phone will have 4 microphones in total and will be capable of recording 3D sounds. No words have been heard regarding the speakers\xa0though.  Verdict:  I don’t know what you think about that “Edge Sense” technology the phone is bringing. But in case you wanna know, what I think about it, then I think it’ll be super gimmicky, period. Just imagine, squeezing your phone for some added functionality, that doesn’t sound handy at all. I tried squeezing my own phone and it felt super awkward, to be honest.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/HTC-U-11.png']

Some of them might be genuine but most of such links are forged to steal sensitive information. This way of stealing info with the means of forged or duplicated website is called Phishing. If you click on such websites and provide the information asked, they could make an illegitimate use to make a profit from them. In this article, we will discuss phishing attacks and ways to be secured from phishing attacks.  What is phishing attack?  Phishing is a malicious attempt to obtain sensitive information disguising as a trustworthy entity through websites. The sensitive information could be usernames, passwords, bank info, Debit/Credit cards info, etc. It can be simply understood as fishing, the way it is pronounced. Just like on fishing, the phishers try to lure you to grab benefits or ask you to rectify the discrepancies regarding your account and requesting you to click certain links. This will be the bait in Phishing. And if you believed in them and provided the information requested, you have taken the bait and unknowingly provided your sensitive information to the phishers. Once the phishers get your information, they can highjack your account and take advantages from them.         In the Phishing technique, the forged or duplicate website will have all the details cloned from the genuine website so that they seem identical. This is the major objective in phishing. The phishers will not let arise a single hint of the doubt to divert the user interest.  How to identify phishing websites?  Checking the website URL would be the most reliable way to identify a phishing website. So you should check the website URL to assure yourself that you are on a safe site.   Domain name    Authenticity of the website can be checked from the URL. Most of the organizations have its name or the acronym as the domain name. If no such information is found in the URL, it could be a phishing website.  Check the complete URL. Sometimes domain name of the genuine website can be used as a subdomain of other websites for phishing purpose. For example,  Facebook.blogspot.com.    Unsecured website   If the website does not have https:// or padlock icon on the URL, the website could possibly be a phishing website.   Spelling or grammatical mistake   Some phishers use website with the domain that closely resembles the original website. Check the spelling and grammatical mistake. If found then it could be a phishing website. For example,\xa0 Fakebook.com  and  Faecbook.com  could be the phishing website of  Facebook.com .  You can also find spelling, grammatical and sometimes technical mistakes on the content of the phishing website. Stay alert!   Enter the URL by yourself   Enter the URL by yourself.\xa0 In the course of entering, if there is auto-filling, then the website could be a genuine one.   String length in URL   If the string in the URL is unusually long then it hints to be a phishing website.  How to be secured from phishing attacks?  Due to advancements in technology and digitization, our information is being vulnerable. So phishing attacks have been a serious threat for all of us. Here are some ways to keep one secured from the phishing attacks.   If the emails and links are from unrecognized senders, ignore it  If you have a doubt, do not risk it: – If you are skeptical about the website, try to contact the organization. If you are asked to fill the bank information, call the bank and find the truth from them.  Check your accounts regularly: – If you make a habit of checking your accounts regularly, you can detect irregularities.  Never send any sensitive information through the mail: – Genuine media never asks to send sensitive information via mail. So never, send such information through the mail.  Do not fall for the offers that are too good to be true  Hesitate to Log into the websites where you barely logout  If you are using an app/software to provide info check the developers and confirm them to be official  Check ‘forget password’ option. Many phishing websites lack them.  Apply unique account unique password rule:- Avoid using same password for several accounts. If one password is leaked, a number of accounts are at stake.  Beware of pop-ups: – Avoid clicking on the pop-up links, copying the links or providing personal information to such links.  Protect your browsing device with a firewall, spam filters, anti-virus and anti-spyware software.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phising2.png']

The question today is can the OnePlus retain its last year’s achievement. Will its next release be as premium and powerful as other 2017 flagships? Well, the answer to these questions were uncertain till the  India Today  shared a design render of the OnePlus 5, yesterday. But this render leak raises another question on itself and that’s how legit is the render? and, Is this really how OnePlus 5 will look like? Here I’ll try to find an answer to that question.  OnePlus 5 Design\xa0Render (Leaked)  Before addressing those questions, let’s talk about the leaked design render first. What is easily noticeable in the design render is the dual cameras on the back. That’s kind of expected. Since many flagship phones and even high tier mid-range phones are coming with dual cameras on the back for the better performance. But not all dual cameras are engineered the same so, what kind of dual camera combination the next OnePlus phone will have is still under the dark. Below the dual cameras is the LED flash and below the flash sits the 1+ trademark. The buttons and their placement seem to be identical to the OnePlus 3/3T. If you were not sure the phone will still retain the 3.5mm Headphone jack placed at the bottom. Thankfully, the phone won’t come with a camera bump\xa0and that’s a good thing.         More on the render, the metal body phone seems to have thrown away the antenna band on top but that on the bottom is still noticeable. It is so faint that you have to watch it with a Hawk-eye.  OnePlus 5 Rumoured Specs:   5.5inch QuadHD (1440p) Optic AMOLED display  Qualcomm Snapdragon 835  6GB/8GB RAM  64GB/128GB Storage  16MP Selfie Unit (same as the 3T)  Dual rear cameras (yet to be confirmed)  Oxygen OS based on Android 7 Nougat  3600mAh battery  front mounted fingerprint sensor   *these are just the rumored specs and this might change when the actual device gets confirmed.  Is this really how OnePlus 5 will look like?  As of now, it’s kind of 50-50. The image has been rolling around the internet but the source is only one. That makes me a little skeptic.\xa0But the design render hits the nail right on the head with those dual cameras which were kind of expected. And, the buttons placement seem legit too. But to confirm how the OnePlus 5 will look like, we have to wait for its official launch that’s expected to be just 2-3 months away.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/OnePlus-5-in-Nepal.png']

But, none the devices are as exciting as that from Google. As major OEMs already released their flagship devices for the year 2017, there are still few yet-to-be-announced devices that are worth waiting for. To name a few, they are the OnePlus 5, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, iPhone 8 and the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. Since the successors to last year’s Google Pixel devices were certain to be announced this year, a new surprising fact has just emerged in the smartphone industry. And that is, you can now expect not two, but three Google Pixel devices this year.  Three Google Pixel Devices for the year 2017  All three Google Pixel devices will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. Recently, three Google devices with SD 835 have been added to the\xa0Android\xa0Open Source Project repository. They are codenamed: “Walleye”, “Muskie”, and “Taimen”. The first two devices are certainly the successor to last year’s Google Pixel and the Pixel XL. The another device named Taimen is rumored to have a screen larger than the Pixel XL. So, it’s likely to be a tablet than a phone. So, it could be the second iteration to the Pixel C, the first Google tablet. It won’t be out of place to mention, the rumors on the third device being a cheaper pixel is also found circulating the web. Since all the devices are powered by Qualcomm’s most powerful chipset, it is less likely to be a cheap device. Hence, my safe bet is on it being the tablet.  These Google devices are likely to be announced somewhere in late September or early October and that’s still a long way from now. Hence, there’s a very little information regarding these devices so far. The rumors claim the devices to have a design language inspired by the Galaxy S8 with the curved screens. Last year, the Google said the devices couldn’t be made waterproof because of the time constraint. So, this year Google devices are more likely to come with some water resistance. The Google Pixel devices are even rumored to have improved camera. And, yet again the phones made by Google are likely to have best cameras in a smartphone for the year 2017. HTC, the last year’s Pixel’s manufacturer, will be manufacturing this year’s devices as well. However, the design will solely be that of Google.        More to Follow.

Now, a month after the release of the F3 Plus, Oppo is all set to launch the mini version of the phone, the Oppo F3. The selfie focused phone is now finally making it’s way to Nepal. So, if you’ve been waiting for something remarkable to up your selfie game, then mark your calendars for May 5.  Update: Oppo F3 Launched in Nepal For Rs. 35,490. Now, it has also seen a price drop of Rs. 2,500 and is available in Nepal for Rs. 32,990\xa0         The Oppo F3 comes with a full metal body with a pretty slick profile. It houses a 5.5-inch Full HD display with thin bezels and has 2.5D glass. It is protected by the latest Corning Gorilla Glass 5 which will protect the display from scratches and minor drops.   The phone is powered by an unspecified MediaTek Processor and comes coupled with 4GB of RAM. Storage wise, it comes with 64GB onboard storage which can be expanded up to 256GB using a dedicated Micro SD Card slot. It also has two separate SIM card slots.  Let’s talk about the biggest asset of the phone; it’s dual front facing camera.\xa0Since it’s titled the “selfie expert”, it houses the same dual front cameras (8MP+16MP) like in the F3 Plus. The 16MP unit has f2.0 aperture so the selfies from it come out detailed and bright. The second 8MP lens is a 120° wide angle one that lets you pack all your friends in one selfie. Hence, this selfie expert is suitable for taking selfies with the wider field of view. However, the photos taken using wide angle lens seem to have lots of grains in non-ideal lighting condition. There are options to shoot selfie time-lapse and panoramas as well. Like other Oppo phones, this too comes with beauty mode for the enhancement of the selfies. There are different options to apply filters and watermarks while taking the photo. Moreover, you can also take double exposure selfies from this phone.   Oppo F3 also comes with Solid State Fingerprint sensor which will unlock the phone even if your fingers are oily or moist. This is certainly a neat feature to have! The phone is backed up by a 3200 mAh battery which is smaller than the 4000mAh battery on the F3Plus. The phone also lacks VOOC charging capability which could have enabled the phone to supercharge.

As the name suggests, the Turbo tag means the phone comes with Quick Charge 2.0 technology which is pretty impressive for a mid-range device.  The phone houses a 5.5inch Full HD display with the pixel density of 401ppi. It is protected with the Corning Gorilla Glass 3. \xa0Powering the phone is the old\xa0Qualcomm MSM8939 v2 Snapdragon 616 Octa-Core Chipset whose four energy efficient cores are clocked at 1.2Ghz and the four high-performance cores are clocked at 1.6GHz. For graphical performance, it comes with Adreno 405 GPU and for multitasking, it comes with 3GB of RAM. This configuration should be enough to get through your normal day to day usage but if you want to use some demanding or heavy apps and games then you’re going to feel the devices resentment.         On the optical front, Vibe P1 Turbo comes with 13MP Rear Camera with f/2.2 aperture and PDAF. It can shoot Full HD videos at 30fps. On the front, it comes with 5MP Camera with f/2.8 aperture. Storage wise, it comes with 32GB Internal Storage and which can be expanded up to 256GB via Micro SD Card. For connectivity, it supports 802.11/ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0 and supports USB OTG as well. It comes with a fingerprint sensor on the front. Backing up the device is a massive  4,900mAh battery  which has added some heft to the device making it 189grams. Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo comes with Quick Charge 2.0. This enables the phone to get charged from 0 to 50% in under 30 mins. It’s a great thing to have the quick charge when your phone comes with a huge battery. Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo is priced at Rs.28,000.  Verdict:  Lenovo Vibe P1 Turbo is all about the battery life. It comes with a massive 4,900mAh battery to last a whole day of usage and if you somehow managed to finish the charge, you can get back on track easily with the Quick Charge. So it’s a great phone for those who wants a pretty reliable battery life.  But we cannot overlook the cons of the phone, to start with, it’s already a year old phone, it is powered by a mediocre last gen chipset and it still runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop. A better alternative for this phone could be the  Coolpad Cool 1 , \xa0Redmi Note 4 ,  Huawei GR5  and the  Galaxy J7 Prime .']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Lenovo-Vibe-P1-Turbo-Cover.png']

But, you do get a\xa0 Mini Dock (Type C to Type A/Type C/HDMI).\xa0 The best thing about this laptop is how well it’s built and how light it is. This laptop weights 910g, and it’s 11.9mm thin. That’s\xa0as thin as most smartphones these days.   Asus’s new laptop runs fairly cool and is a serious\xa0looker — all because of copper-alloy heat pipes and liquid-crystal-polymer fan.

['Doogee Mix: a new cheap bezelless smartphone'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['April 24, 2017']",2017-04-24 07:08:00+00:00,"['Xiaomi, the company well known for copying the design language of others, somehow managed to get an innovative tagline with the release of  Xiaomi Mi Mix . The Mi Mix got a warm welcome in the smartphone industry for its\xa0bezelless\xa0design, at least on the three sides of the screen. But, the\xa0Doogee\xa0launched a new phone at the Global Sources fair in HongKong named “Doogee\xa0Mix” that doesn’t just sound like Mi Mix but also looks like Mi Mix. That said, these two phones have pronounceable differences as well and that’s what you’ll find in this post.  Doogee\xa0Mix: What We Know so Far  Doogee,\xa0the Chinese company that is popular in its homeland for producing quality budget phones, recently managed to get international attentions with its latest release. There are two reasons for that. The first being the\xa0tri-bezelless\xa0screen and the second being the pricing. The phone that looks like Mi Mix will cost you less than half of its price. The\xa0rumors claim the phone to be a sub$200 one. Plus, not just the design but the specifications of the phone look equally impressive on paper. As far as the naming is concerned, the company says it came up with the name “Mix” as the combined form of Minimum and Maximum. The phone with smaller form factor sports a maximum display. The display is said maximum not because of its size but for its design that has been stretched to three sides of the phone.  Coming to the differences between Mi Mix and the\xa0Doogee\xa0Mix, the first is the screen size. The\xa0Dooze\xa0Mix has a smaller screen size of 5.5inch, Full HD IPS LCD screen. This new cheap\xa0bezelless\xa0smartphone comes with Helio X25 processor, 4GB\xa0RAM\xa0and the 64GB storage. The rumors claim there will be a higher-end variant of the phone that will have Helio X30, 6GB\xa0RAM\xa0and 128GB storage. \xa0Unlike the Mi Mix, the phone has a slim physical earpiece on the top and the front mounted fingerprint sensor. For the cameras, it has a dual lens (16MP + 8MP) on the back and the 8MP unit on the front chin. The phone runs on Android 7 Nougat and houses a 4050mAh battery.        Verdict:  Well, the phone looks and sounds interesting but the fact is the phones like this will never make to the market outside of its homeland, China. So, it’s better not to expect availability of the phone in Nepal. However, this phone launch is hinting towards the bezelless\xa0era of smartphones. We now can expect to see more phones with smaller bezels and larger displays not just in flagship ranges but in mid and budget ranges as well.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/doogee-mix.png']
['Apex Digital Launched Smart Diary in Nepal'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['April 23, 2017']",2017-04-23 09:09:24+00:00,"['Apex Digital , has launched Smart Diary in Nepal last week. The diary is available for purchase exclusively at any  Apex Digital Smart Stores . The diary comes in three different colors (pink, green and black) and is priced at NRs. 3,999. The smart diary comes with 10000mAh battery pack so that you can charge your phones on the go. Additionally, you can also find a flash drive with a capacity of 8GB placed beautifully on its clip.  A Closer Look at the “Smart Diary” from Apex Digital   The smart diary from Apex Digital comes in three different colors of Pink, Green, and Black. Not just the colors, these diaries differ in the texture used on their covers as well. The Green one has a little rough texture to it and the black on has a smoother on and that of pink is just in-between. The diary gives a nice feeling to the hands while carrying. Thanks to the leather like material on top and padding used inside of it. The diary has a magnetic clip to it and the detachable flash drive is placed well in it. When opening the diary from the front there’s nothing much different about it with some card compartments\xa0underneath the cover and first page to mention the personal information. Turning further, you’ll find some important emergency numbers followed by the map of Nepal. The following three pages have the month calendar for the year 2017. Thereafter, comes the regular diary pages for keeping the memorandum.         It is at the last page of the diary that you’ll find the instruction paper. In case, you’re wondering what’s so smart about the diary then it comes after turning the last page. That is when you’ll find three different connecting cables of the power bank with the capacity of 10,000mAh. The first USB cable connector is for charging the power bank itself. Next two cables are for charging your iOS or Android device with lightening port or USB type B port, respectively. There are also four LED lights for the indication of battery level of the power bank. To turn on the power bank there’s a button alongside the battery indicator. When you’re done charging your device, just detach your device and the power bank will turn off by itself after few seconds from detachment.  Verdict:  Well, it’s kind of a new product and we don’t get to see many of such products in Nepal. As far as my opinions are concerned, I’d say this isn’t the diary for everyone. It is for those who keep carrying three things, pen drive, power bank and a diary, separately almost like every day. With a purchase of this smart diary, you can have all those three things more organized.        1  of 4                                                          But in my daily use, this dairy was a little heavier than the last ones I used, it may be because the 10000mAh battery pack contributing good weight to the overall weight of the diary. It won’t be out of place to mention the diary itself and the pages used in it are of good quality.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Apex-Smart-Diary-in-Nepal.jpg']

The data I’ve going to use here is from the Motorola’s Survey titled\xa0“ Cracked Screens and Broken Hearts “. 6,000 Participants from 6 different countries participated in the survey. From the survey, it was found over 50% people around the globe have\xa0broken their phones on one or more occasions.

So, this phone is now more likely to get broken and even the Samsung knows it very well. As Samsung Mobile Nepal has offered 6months breakage Insurance on every S8 and S8 plus units being sold in Nepal.        This Insurance covers the breaking of the glass or screen from any side of the phone. The company guarantees replacement of genuine glass or screen within 2-3 days. The charges will be nominal. If the cost of repair is anything below Rs. 6,000, the owner of the phone has to pay the exact price for the repair. But, if the repair cost is anything over Rs. 6,000, the\xa0owner will only have to pay the Rs.6,000. The rest of the repair cost will be covered by the insurance. And, in case you break your new S8 and S8 Plus in a way that can’t be repaired. For instance, you got your phone run over by a motorbike or car then the insurance will get your phone not repaired but rather replaced with a new one.  Verdict:  It’s a really nice initiative from Samsung Mobile Nepal. I think other companies should also come up with such insurance plans in days to come.

Now after 2 years of pause, the company is back again with a new product, the Turing Phone Appasionato. The phone, unlike the previous version, doesn’t claim to be Unhackable, but instead, it is the first widely manufactured phone made out of  Liquidmorphium .   Build quality and toughness seems to be the words at play here. The phone is made out of Liquidmorphium, a type of alloy that is more durable than steel and titanium. Beautiful design and sturdy build quality are definitely what we crave for, but the phones these days have to sacrifice the toughness for the beauty of the phone. Liquidmorphium can definitely change that. The phone will also have diamond-like carbon coating which provides a high-tech ceramic feel and makes the device less prone to scratches. And most importantly, it will use ultra-strong sapphire glass for its display. It is the same glass Apple uses for the lens of the iPhone Cameras. With this, we could finally be heading towards a future with shatterless displays.         Despite the build quality, most of the internals of the phone are of outdated. The phone is powered by Snapdragon 820 Processor and comes with Adreno 530 GPU. The phone will be running on Android 7.1.1. Apart from this, not much has been revealed about the phone. The phone has a long way to go until its release date, which is in September. So many things could change during that time. But apart from specs, the unique thing about the phone is, it provides it’s own Personal Assistant and concierge service named\xa0 “Sir Alan.”  The Turing Phone\xa0Appassionato will come in two variants, namely:  Elite PX8  which costs $1,099; and the Premium Luxury Edition  GX8 , costing $1,599.

The phone was found listed on the Russian site of the company, which is expected to go on sale later this month for\xa0RUB 19,990 which is around USD 335. The major focus of the phone is given to its battery life and comes with a massive 4,000mAh battery which the company claims will last for 2 whole days of usage.  Being a mid-range phone of 2017, it comes with a familiar set of specs. It carries a 5.5-inch Full HD display with pixel density of 401ppi and is protected with an unspecified version of the Gorilla Glass. Powering the phone is Helio P10 octa-core processor clocked at 1.8Ghz. Paired with that comes 3GB of RAM. For graphical performance, it has Mali-T860MP2 GPU. The phone also comes in a sleek metal body with typical HTC design and carries a fingerprint sensor on the back.

The phone comes with HTC’s Boost+ function which dynamically manages the phones resources to provide better performance while gaming.

The company’s choice to offer some top quality smartphones in an affordable price range is really commendable. Even while launching some high-end flagship devices, the company hasn’t forgotten about its budget smartphone department. The launch of a new budget device tells this story. The Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus is a budget oriented device that features a not-so-new design.  The Enjoy 7 Plus has a tall form factor as it sports a 5.5-inch display with some large bezels on the top and bottom. Probably the downside of the device is the display as it comes with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels with 267 ppi. Underneath the hood, the device is powered by an Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor with the clock speed of 1.4 GHz. Huawei has coupled this processor with 3GB of RAM and an older Adreno 505 GPU.  The major selling point of the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus is its battery. The device boasts a huge 4000 mAh battery. This battery will go nicely with the low-res 720p display.        Camera wise, the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus comes with a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera that has autofocus functionality. The primary camera is capable of taking videos up to 1080p. The camera at the front is of 8-megapixel which will surely take some social media ready pictures.   It runs on Google’s Android v7.0 Nougat right out of the box. Storage wise, the device packs 32GB of onboard storage with an option to expand it via a microSD card. A fingerprint scanner rests below the camera at the back. The device comes in three color options: Gray, White, and Gold.  Talking about its pricing, the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus will go on sale for around CNY 1,600 which roughly converts to around $230. While Huawei has been offering some great devices at a much lower price range, I personally don’t like the price of the Enjoy 7 Plus. Yes, it does feature a huge 4,000 mAh battery but the display is just of 720p.  Also, regarding its pricing, Chinese smartphone’s prices never translate to 1:1 in other currencies or countries when mobile devices are offered outside of the mainland. So, if the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus is launched here in Nepal, you can expect it to come at a higher price tag.

Yes, you read that right! Duo, a New York based start-up, has created an AI powered computer: Albert , that looks and \xa0works like a mirror but performs much more than reflection.  Keeping aside the hardware, the key specifications of the Duo computer can be listed as follows-         27″ full HD 1080p display  27″ 5-point multi-touch reflective surface  Built-in microphone and speakers (connecting to separate Bluetooth speaker)  Built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth  Duo Core chip (onboard processor)  HomeOS including Albert Engine  Native apps including Duo Music, Duo News, Duo App Store   According to the details released on the company’s official website, the main body of the machine weighs approximately 8 pounds. The separate computer box weighs less than 1 pound. The reflective surface, 0.25” two-way mirror, has been treated with a coat of anti-fingerprint (oleophobic). And the back panel and casing is ABS plastic.  Like other home AI assistants Alexa and Google Home, Albert is controlled by voice commands. It can understand commands to play music, videos, check the news, switch on/off the lights, or turn into a virtual art gallery through its own native apps and others that can be downloaded from the Duo App Store. It\xa0will also give you informations regarding the weather, your calendar, a summary of the main news stories, your favorite recipe.  The company has described it’s product as an AI computer for home and it’s pretty true to that fact. The computer almost makes up for an AI Butler. This virtual assistant named Albert, can also be customized by changing its name, gender, and accent.  The Duo\xa0looks like just about any other mirror you’d hang on your living room wall when it’s not in use and hence easily blends with the decor. But there is so much more to it than it just being another connected device or standalone AI assistant that complements your smart home setup — it’s a full-on home computer system housed in a mirror.  The computer is packed with with it’s own operating system –\xa0HomeOS. And the Duo team has also some promising offers for interested developers. The team has a specialized web-based HomeOS SDK for developers interested in building new apps for the system.  As of now, hands-on experience for this out of the world computing technology have not yet been permitted. Nevertheless, the company started taking pre-orders for the device on Tuesday and plans to ship its first batch to customers sometime this October. The first 5,000 people to order one will get it for $399, but after that, the price will increase to $500.   The Duo’s introductory video is as promising as it gets.

['Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 Review: A Fancy Midrange Phone'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['April 11, 2017']",2017-04-11 12:18:17+00:00,"['Samsung, the Korean giant that already has a good standing on budget and flagship ranges with its Galaxy J series and Galaxy S series\xa0smartphones wants to take over in the midrange segment with the introduction of Galaxy A series smartphones starting from last year. This A series phones have got a second iteration this year and for last two weeks, we’ve used the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017, the latest and greatest phone in this lineup. Here’s what we think about the device and let’s find out where this big screen water resistant phone stands against its competition.  Design:  Starting with the design, it is where the phone easily surpasses the competition. The glass-clad phone with metal all around it seems to borrow the design language right from the company’s last year’s flagship the Galaxy S7. The phone is premium to look at and hold. The curved glass at the back does aid in providing good grip while using the device. The phone is truly a fingerprint magnet so get ready to rub your phone against your cloth every now and then. Design-wise, this is the fanciest mid-range phone that we’ve reviewed so far.  Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 is priced at Rs. 54,900 in Nepal.  On the back, the phone is all clean with Samsung logo below the back camera and the flash. Thankfully, the phone doesn’t have a camera bump and lays flat on the table. On the front, the phone looks like a chunk of glass with big screens, thin borders, and obvious head and chin. The head has the proximity sensor, metal earpiece, and the front camera. The chin has a fingerprint sensor embedded in the home button with backlit capacitive buttons on the side. The phone has a tray for sim2 and micro SD card and a secondary mic on the top. On the right, it has a loudspeaker and the power button. Micro USB type C, primary mic, and the 3.5mm headphone jack are placed on the bottom edge. And, the volume rockers and the sim1 tray are placed on the left edge.        Display:  The A7 2017 has a big 5.7inch Super AMOLED Full HD display that has deeper blacks and great contrast. The colors are well saturated and do pop out like every other Samsung OLED displays. But if you’re coming from an LCD screen this might look a bit artificial to you and you can get the colors that you’d rather prefer by setting the screen mode to the “basic”. The viewing angles are super wide and the display is pretty bright and I had no issues while using the device outdoors. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 but still, I got few unintentional scratches on them so I would suggest you to apply some screen protection to the display just to play it safe.   Performance:  Now, it is in the performance where the phone doesn’t keep up with the competition both on paper and in real life use. That said, the phone that is powered by Exynos 7880 Octacore CPU and coupled with 3GB RAM is no super slow or anything. The app loading times aren’t that long and the phone is capable of running graphics intensive games as well. But it is when I tried switching the apps that were opened a while ago, the device took much longer than other phones in the same price range would do.      Galaxy A7 2017 Benchmark Scores (Antutu and GeekBench 4)   1  of 5                                                                    And, there were a few times when the device didn’t respond to the touches but I’m still not sure if it’s the display issue or the device issue. I played few games like Modern Combat 5 and Asphalt 8 and I wasn’t disappointed with its gaming performance. Plus, the phone didn’t have any heating issues even in my prolonged gaming sessions. Like the J7 prime, the loudspeaker is placed at the right top edge and is now less likely to be covered while gaming but I’ve used phones from same price range with much louder and richer loudspeaker. Lastly, the fingerprint sensor’s performance is sub-par and is not so impressive.  Software/UI:  The phone runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow but the real sweetness is the Grace UX that is minimalistic and flashy at the same time. The slightly rounded icons look pleasing to the eyes and the interface is much lighter and faster. The colored icons in quick settings to represent what is on and what is not are a welcome edition as well. What I liked the most are the grouping of notifications it does, and the split-screen mode that can be enabled by long pressing the recent app button.      Grace UX (screenshots)   1  of 10                                                                                                                      Camera:  It is when using the cameras the phone started to win my heart again. The phone houses 16MP, f1.9 units both on the front and the back that take 4:3 photos in full megapixel and 16:9 photos in 12megapixels. The primary camera focuses really fast and the photos come well-detailed with a little of over-saturation. The Camera app is much cleaner and comes with different modes and filters, that can be accessed by swiping from left and right respectively. The floating camera app button and swiping vertically on the camera app to switch cameras are other cool features. You can take 30 burst photos both from the front and the back by long pressing the shutter. The front cameras are on point in reproducing right skin tone and the selfies can be tuned to look even better by different beautification options like skin tone, skin smoothing, and large eyes.      Camera Samples   1  of 10               Photo of Owl taken from Samsung Galaxy A7 2017         Captured using Samsung Galaxy A7 2017                Samsung Galaxy 2017 Back Camera shoots well detailed photos         Low Light Photo Sample         Front Camera Sample (Normal)         Front Camera Sample (Beauty Mode: On)         Samsung Galaxy 2017 Macro Shot                                                        Coming to the videos the phone can shoot 1080p videos at 30fps at the highest both from the front and the back. Though the phone has an option for software video stabilization, the camera unit doesn’t have Optical Image Stabilization and that can be felt while trying to shoot videos while walking. Coming to where the camera suffers the most, it is under the low-light conditions when the photos come too noisy with lots of grains in them.  Connectivity and Sensors:  For wireless connectivity, the phone comes with\xa0Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac\xa0with dual-band support and Bluetooth 4.2. Other sensors used in the phone are GPS, NFC,\xa0accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, and barometer. The phone supports Dual 4G SIMs and a microSD card. The Wi-Fi networks and data were stable and I had no problems while calling.\xa0The call quality was excellent, so was the audio coming out from 3.5mm headphone jack. The volume of the earpiece is already loud and in the case of hearing aid needed while on a call, there is an option for “extra-volume” from the earpiece as well.  Battery:  Comparing with the phones in similar price range based on the battery performance, Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 is without a doubt a definite winner. The phone with 3600mAh battery gave me an insane battery life worth a full day even in my heavy usage. If you want to enhance the already good battery life then you could do so by turning off the always on display that drained the battery a little faster during the time of my review. In last 10days, I’ve charged the phone for 7 times in total.      Battery Performance   1  of 3                                                Verdict:  The Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 isn’t the right phone for everyone. It’s for those who prioritize looks over performance. If you need a water resistant phone to address your multimedia needs and that lasts longer on a single charge then it’s the phone for you. But if you want a phone with the performance worth the price then you should be looking somewhere else.

It feels amazing to be carefree about your battery life when it lasts for two whole days.  Then comes the flagship grade design in a midrange phone. It’s easily one of the great looking phones in this price range.  Having a phone with IP68 certified water and dust resistance makes me feel confident to\xa0use my phone even in dusty roads of Kathmandu and while raining.  This phone has an impressive display that has good contrast, great colors and amazing outdoor visibility.   What I Disliked About Samsung Galaxy A7 2017:   The performance of the phone is sub-par as compared that of phones in similar price range. That way, the performance doesn’t seem to do justice to the price tag of the phone.  The second disappointment from this phone is its fingerprint sensor which isn’t as fast and accurate as that of the phones in similar price range.  Since\xa0it’s a phone of 2017, it was expected to be running on Android Nougat out of the box but it doesn’t.   If you weren’t impressed by the Samsung Galaxy A7, Here are some other options you can consider:  OnePlus 3T  Priced at Rs. 54,900, the OnePlus 3T sports a 5.5-inch 1080P Optic AMOLED display with 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass 4 protection. It houses a 16MP (f/2.0, Sony IMX298 sensor, OIS, 4K) rear and 16MP (f/2.0, Samsung 3P8SP sensor, PDAF, 1080p) front cameras. It is powered by Snapdragon 821 processor, 6GB RAM, and 3400mAh battery. It is running on Oxygen OS based on Android 6 Marshmallow and is upgradable to Android 7 Nougat.  Oppo F3Plus  Another great device in the same price range is the Oppo F3Plus that sports 6inch 1080p IPS LCD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. It houses a 16MP (f/1.7, dual phase detection autofocus, OIS, dual tone LED flash) rear and dual 16MP + 8MP (wide angle) front cameras. It is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 653, 4GB RAM and 4000mAh battery. The phone boots on ColorOS 3.0 based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.  Samsung Galaxy S7  After the recent price cut, the last year’s Samsung’s flagship, the Galaxy S7 now falls on near-to price range and is another device to be considered. The phone is now available to buy on Rs. 57,900. The phone sports a 5.1-inch QHD (1440 x 2560 pixels) Super AMOLED display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4. It houses a 12MP, f/1.7 rear and 5MP, f/1.7 front cameras. It is powered by\xa0Exynos 8890, 4GB RAM, and 3000mAh battery. The phone boots on Android 6 Marshmallow but is upgradable to Android 7 Nougat.']",[]
['Infocus M535 Review: All About Looks'],"['infocus', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 10, 2017']",2017-04-10 10:15:46+00:00,"['The increasing number of smartphone companies in Nepal has resulted in more number of devices releasing in each and every price segment. We have been witnessing the release if some great smartphones. But while doing so, manufacturers have now started selling some old pieces of hardware. Not saying it’s a bad thing or anything since we are getting to see some great devices at a cheaper price. Doing the same thing is Infocus, as the American company has released the Infocus M535, more than a year old device.  Priced at Rs. 17,490 (2GB) and Rs. 19,990 (3GB), according to the variant you purchase, I got to play with the device for a week. And here is my verdict.  Key Specs of Infocus M535:          5.5-inch IPS display,\xa0720 x 1280 pixels  Corning Gorilla Glass 3 upfront  MediaTek MT6735 SoC;  Quad-core processor with 1.5GHz clock speed  Mali-T720 GPU  Android v6.0 Marshmallow\xa0with InLife UI  2GB/3GB RAM  Internal Storage: 16/32GB  Expandable Storage: Up to 64GB  Rear Camera:\xa013 MP, LED flash  Front Camera:\xa08 MP  Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, WiFi Direct, hotspot, Bluetooth 4.1  Sensors:\xa0accelerometer, gyro, proximity  2600 mAh Non-removable battery  Price: Rs. 17,490 / Rs. 19,490   DESIGN  These days even the lower-end smartphones feature metallic back, and the Infocus M535 is no different. The device comes in a metal back that is bordered by two plastic bands. \xa0The metal back of the device feels premium, but the review unit we received has somewhat of a bulged out plastic band which makes a lot of that ‘Kiiirrrkkkkk’ noise when pressed.   On the plastic back up top, a rear-facing camera sits along with an LED flash. There’s a company branding on the metal. Up front, the device features a 5.5-inch display with some rather larger bezels at the top and bottom. The large bezels have made the device look a bit bland. On the top is an earpiece, a few sensors and a front-facing speaker.        1  of 5                                                                    The power button, the volume rockers, and the SIM slots sit at the sides. One issue I had with the volume rockers is that they are placed a bit higher than what I am used to. The SIM and microSD card slot is placed right above the power button. Down below, there is a single bottom firing speaker and a microUSB connector. Oh, and the device does come with a headphone jack.  DISPLAY  Like the devices of its price range, the Infocus M535 sports an HD display. The IPS display measures 5.5-inch and come with the resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels.   Unlike the Epic 1, the last Infocus device I reviewed, the M535 has no ugly black band around the display. Right off the box, the display looked bright. But once I streamed a HD video on the device, I realized that it lacked the sharpness and vibrancy. I had expected a bit more from the display even though it comes with a 720p resolution. The gaming experience is nice on the large display, but again, it lacked the sharpness, and wasn’t all that colorful and saturated. The viewing angle of the device is good and the gaming experience is decent, though.  SOFTWARE  Software wise, the Infocus M535 runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with InLife UI on top. Even though I am aligned towards stock UI, I had no problem using Infocus’ skin. I, however, decreased the animation scale of the device as the software felt a bit slower for me.   But it does come with a few bloatware which I didn’t actually use. One of the best features of my primary smartphone is the inclusion of different gestures. But I missed those gestures dearly when the M535 became my primary device for a week. Nonetheless, the software experience of the M535 is good and lag free.  PERFORMANCE  On to the performance, the Infocus M535 is powered by a Quad-core MediaTek MT6735 processor with the clock speed of 1.5GHz. The SoC is coupled with Mali-T720 GPU and 2GB or 3GB of RAM, according to the variant you purchase.  The device sometimes lagged when I had tons of apps running in the background. Other than that, I had no issues with the performance of the device.  HARDWARE  On the hardware side, the Infocus M535, like I already mentioned, comes with a single bottom firing speaker. It is average and not that very loud, but it gets the job done, nonetheless. One problem with speakers at the bottom is that it gets covered easily while using a device in a landscape mode. And I had the same issue with M535’s speaker.   Being a two year old device, it comes with a microUSB v2.0 port for connectivity and charging. Alongside the charging port is a primary mic. There is a secondary mic on the top which really helps in background noise cancellation.  The Infocus M535 ships with 16GB of onboard storage with an option to expand it up to 64GB via a microSD card slot.  CAMERA  The Infocus M535 is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera. In a well-lit environment, the pictures from the camera come out decent. It, however, lacks the proper sharpness and color reproduction. Like every other smartphone of its price range, the camera of the device suffers under low light. The pictures come out way too noisy and grainy.   The front-facing camera of the Infocus M535 measures 8-megapixels. Before anything, I would like to mention the unusual lines that appear when taking selfies in the night time. I don’t really know what those lines are but it really tells us all about the camera quality of the device. Under ample lighting, the front camera takes decent social media ready selfies.  The camera app comes with some gestures for taking pictures. But I would have liked it if Infocus had concentrated on the camera quality rather than these gimmicky features.  CONNECTIVITY  The device comes with dual Nano-SIM slots with only one slot supporting 4G connectivity. It also supports memory expansion through a microSD card slot. Then 16GB of onboard storage can be expanded up to 64GB. During calls, people didn’t really complain about the call quality. Also, the inclusion of a secondary mic has helped in making the call quality a bit better.  The Infocus M535 has a Gyro sensor for an excellent VR experience. It, however, lacks a fingerprint sensor. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, WiFi Direct, hotspot, Bluetooth 4.1  BATTERY  The Infocus M535 houses a small 2600mAh battery. Since the device features a 720p display, I had expected the battery to last a bit longer even if it was a tad bit smaller. But I only got around 3.5-4 hours of screen-on-time under heavy usage. My usage included gaming, internet browsing and calling. Even with moderate use, the battery didn’t last all day. So, you will have to carry around your charger if you intend to buy this phone.   The device has no fast-charging option. There is, however, a power saver option which increases the battery life slightly.  Conclusion  The trend of smartphone manufacturers and distributors releasing devices has brought forward a massive competition. Infocus surely realized that and launched the Infocus M535 here in Nepal. But since it is a two-year-old piece of tech, you might not actually find some of the newer features in the device.  All in all, the Infocus M535 is a midrange device that offers good design and bigger display for your multimedia needs. If good looking design and a bigger display are your priority, this would be a right choice. However, if you want a better performance, better camera, and better battery life, you should be looking somewhere else.  IF YOU’RE WEREN’T IMPRESSED BY THE INFOCUS M535, HERE ARE SOME OTHER OPTIONS YOU CAN CONSIDER:  Huawei GR5 Mini  Priced at Rs. 19,999, the Huawei GR5 Mini packs a\xa0Octa-core\xa0Kirin 650 processor with 2GB of RAM. It sports a 5.2-inch full HD display. A large 3,000 mAh battery backs the device.   Xiaomi Mi4  The Xiaomi Mi4 sports a 5-inch 1080 x 1920 pixels display which is cloaked by Gorilla Glass 3. It is powered by a Quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor with 2.5GHz processor. The SoC is aided by Adreno 330 GPU and 3GB of RAM. The Xiaomi Mi4 is available at Rs. 17,999.   ZTE Blade V7 Lite  The Zte V7 Lite comes in a metal body. The device is powered by a Quad-core MediaTek MT6735P processor with 1.0GHz clock speed. It features a fast fingerprint scanner.The 13MP back and 5MP front camera is also decent considering the price of Rs. 17,390.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/infocus-M535-review-13.jpg']

Xiaomi Mi Notebooks looks great aesthetically and there’s no competition for its lightness. Specifically, the Mi Notebook Air 12.5 which weighs just 1.07Kg. But for the price of lightness, you are getting a fairly underpowered processor which might not be adequate if your work needs a little more power.  The Mi Notebook 13.3 is also a pretty good pick but if you look elsewhere then the  Dell XPS 13  can be a great alternative or you can just get the  Apple MacBook 13.3 Air .  All and all these notebooks were targeted for the people who want a lighter computer for their daily commute without breaking their back carrying a hefty laptop. Xiaomi Mi Notebooks can be a perfect pick for anyone who has to travel and work.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Xiaomi-Mi-Notebook-Nepal-GadgetbyteNepal.png']

Like the S7,\xa0the phone is made using the glass and the metal. The 2.5D glass on the front and the curved 3D glass on the back does feel good on the hands but are a true fingerprint magnet. The metal frame along the edges that is slightly curved aids in making the phone look more premium. The phone is a little heavy but that is considerable for a 5.7inch phone.        The 5.7inch Super AMOLED display is pretty bright and the colors look pretty punchy as well. The display with options for “always-on” is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 5.  The A7 2017 is running on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and the Samsung’s Grace UI\xa0looks much impressive than the TouchWiz UI. The phone does come with some bloatware and most of them can be considered to be the useful ones. During our early usage, the device has a quick response and the apps loaded pretty quickly as well.   Coming to the cameras, it has 16MP, f/1.9 units both on the front and the back that are capable of shooting videos of 1080p at the highest. The early samples taken from both the cameras look promising. The camera app is pretty easy to catch with.  This IP68 certified water and dust resistant phone packs 3600 mAh battery and during the time of my early impression, I did notice the battery was keeping up pretty well. So, we can expect good battery life from this phone with power efficient processor and OLED display.  The fingerprint sensor is fast and pretty reliable. Just like the J7 prime, the loudspeaker is placed at the top right edge and is pretty loud indeed.      Samsung Galaxy A7 2017   1  of 3                                                This was our early impression on the galaxy A7 2017 and after using the phone for a couple of weeks, we’ll surely be releasing its full review.

Samsung has officially launched the Samsung Gear S3 frontier here in Nepal. The company has priced the product at Rs. 41,900 and is available from different smartphone retail outlets and from  online store smart doko .  Released in November last year, the launch of the device came in as a surprise to many as the high-end smartwatch market has been on a decline. As far as the specifications go, the Samsung Gear S3 comes with a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display with the resolution of 360 x 360 pixels (278 for the PPI). Just like most of Samsung’s high-end devices, this watch also supports the always-on display, which, of course, is really necessary for a smartwatch (duh!). The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass SR+. The display is lined by a circular bezel that spins and lets you breeze through the OS.  The Gear S3 frontier is a premium watch that is covered in stainless steel 316L. It weighs just around 63 grams. The device is IP69 certified, meaning it can survive under 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes.        Underneath the hood, the Samsung Gear S3 frontier is powered by a Dual-core Exynos 7270 processor clocked at 1.0 GHz. This is coupled with 768MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. On the software side, the device runs on Samsung’s very own Tizen-based wearable 2.3.2 OS. This is disappointing as the many apps for the operating system aren’t available just yet.  The Gear S3 frontier supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. It is backed by a non-removable 380 mAh Li-Ion battery. The battery can be charged via WPC wireless charging.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gear-S3-frontier.jpg']

Take for instance the S7 Edge, it’s still a great phablet and comes with similar specs compared to S8.         2. The latest features aren’t a must  The new features added in the newest flagships are great and attractive to the users but is it really necessary? The 4k video recording, iris scanner, modularity, waterproofing, forced touch etc. aren’t a must for daily usage. The features are definitely plus points but are not worth the extra money.   3. Latest smartphones may have unknown bugs  When you buy the latest smartphone you are taking a risk as there may be some uncovered hardware or software bugs. But when you opt for an older handset you can find its problems and solutions and there are already lots of problem documentation and information on forums, which can be really helpful.  Photo source: DetroitBORG  4. Old flagships are cheaper  So another reason to approach older phones is that it will be much cheaper than the flagships. All people cannot afford the expensive latest smartphone so people can choose to buy the cheaper older flagship.

['Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge cash back offer: Great time to buy the 2016 flagship?'],"['Android', 'Samsung']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['April 2, 2017']",2017-04-02 01:21:50+00:00,"['It has only been a couple of days since Samsung unveiled its latest flagship – the Galaxy S8.   The Korean company showed off the two variants of the device at an event in New York. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great looking devices with some great specifications. They are set to launch in the first week of May in Nepal. Keeping that in mind, Samsung Nepal has brought a cash back offer for their predecessors.  Talking about the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, even though it has been a year since their launch, they still work great. The devices are powered by an Octa-core Exynos 8890 Octa CPU which is aided by 4GB of LP DDR4 RAM and Mali-T880 MP12 GPU.         Display wise, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge come with 5.1-inch and 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display respectively. Both feature a 1440 x 2560 pixels quadHD resolution. Samsung has already started to roll out the Android v7.0 Nougat update to its flagship of 2016.  For the photography lovers, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are equipped with 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with f/1.7 aperture and Optic Image Stabilization. The recently launched Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature a similar camera setup. At the front, the devices feature a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with the same aperture. They take some good social media ready selfies.   Storage wise, the S7 and S7 Edge have more storage options than their successor. Both devices come with two storage options: 32GB and 64GB. It can be expanded up to 256GB due to the microSD card slot available in the devices.  On the battery front, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge house a 3,000 mAh and a 3,600 mAh battery respectively. In our review, we got a screen on time of around 4 hours which can be considered decent. The battery in the devices charges up within 1.5 hours. The phones, however, lack USB Type-C connectivity.   When the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were launched last year, they came with a price tag of Rs. 77,900 and Rs. 88,900 respectively. And now, after the release of the Galaxy S8, Samsung is now offering cash back while buying the aforementioned devices. Buyers will get Rs. 20,000 cash back on both these devices. After exercising the offer, the Galaxy S7 will come with a price tag of Rs. 57,900, and the Galaxy S7 Edge will come with a price tag of Rs. 68,900.  The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a great device. Samsung took a revolutionary step by going with an almost bezel-less display with a different aspect ratio. But the company’s flagship of 2016 doesn’t fall behind. It is still a great looking device and features a good camera. So, you won’t regret your decision if you decide on opting for the S7 or the S7 edge rather than waiting for the Galaxy S8.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Samsung-S7-Edge-Price-Nepal-2017.jpg']

['18:9 Screen Aspect Ratio: Is it here to stay?'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 31, 2017']",2017-03-31 07:47:57+00:00,"['It’s the LG that pioneered in bringing 18:9 screen aspect ratio to the smartphones.\xa0The LG G6 is the first phone to sport odd 18:9 aspect ratio on its display. Well, there are many different reasons for LG to come with such decision and we’ll surely be discussing on that. But following its footsteps, even the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with fairly similar 18.5:9 aspect ratio. So the question now is, is 18:9 screen aspect ratio the next de facto for future smartphone displays?  What’s so good about 18:9 screen smartphones over 16:9 screen smartphones?   The screens with 18:9 or should I say 2:1 aspect ratio, aid in better one hand usability. The taller and narrower phones are giving us better ergonomics without compromising on the screen size.  The 2:1 screen aspect ratio seems more practical for multitasking giving better rooms for two apps to be running on square (1:1) split-screens.  Since the multimedia contents (Cinematographies and TV shows) have already started being shot and produced on Univisium\xa0Format (2:1). It makes more sense to watch such contents on the screen of same aspect ratio.  Reading web-contents have become easier in taller displays as they will accommodate more lines on the same page.   What are the current challenges for opting 18:9 screen smartphones over 16:9 screen Smartphones?  Though the 18:9 screen smartphones are already available for purchase and use. The first few months, the experience with the phone wouldn’t be that rich. Since\xa0it is only recently that phones with such odd screen aspect ratio made their debut so the contents and the apps aren’t that responsive for such screen type. So, what is the use of a phone with big screen and thin bezels that will still produce black borders by the side of the contents that are based on 16:9 aspect ratio. But, since Google already requested its developers to make their apps to support taller display types, we can expect more apps supporting this 2:1 aspect ratio with time.  Is 18:9 screen aspect ratio the next de facto for future smartphones?  Well, I so much want to go with the “solid Yes” as the answer but for now, I’ll keep myself on the hold since it’ll be too early to judge. But with such big names in mobile phone industry already producing phone screens with the 18:9 aspect ratio, it certainly hinting towards this screen type is here to stay. Not just for the content, but for the usability as well. This aspect ratio makes more sense than any. This new screen aspect ratio already seems to address the customer’s dream of having a big screen phone that doesn’t feel so big on the hands.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18-9-screen-phone.png']
['Oppo F3 Plus Review: More Than Just a Selfie Expert'],"['OPPO', 'Reviews']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 30, 2017']",2017-03-30 15:53:53+00:00,"['If there’s anything that the youth loves more than social media, it’s clicking selfies. The selfie obsession has reached a fever pitch, so much, so that each time you walk into a public spot, you’ll find yourself surrounded by hundreds of pout faces and smirks. Understanding this obsession, Oppo has been releasing its phones in “F-lineup” that the company titles for being the selfie experts. Stepping up this selfie game, Oppo has launched the very new dual selfie camera phone, the  Oppo F3 Plus . This phone has dual selfies cameras and lot’s more. Let’s find out what else this phone is offering other than the wide angle selfies.  Key Specs of Oppo F3 Plus:   6-inch IPS LCD display,\xa01080 x 1920 pixels,\xa0367 ppi,\xa0Corning Gorilla Glass 5  Qualcomm Snapdragon 653;\xa0Octa-core processor,\xa0Adreno 510  4GB RAM/ 64GB internal  Rear Camera:\xa016 MP, f/1.7, dual phase detection autofocus, OIS, dual tone LED flash  Front Camera:\xa0Dual 16 MP, f/2.0 + 8 MP (120°), 1/3″ sensor size  ColorOS 3.0 (Android 6.0 Marshmallow)  Hybrid DualSIM/microSD card slot (up to 256GB)  Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, WiFi Direct, hotspot, Bluetooth 4.1  Sensors:\xa0Fingerprint (front-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass  4000 mAh battery;\xa0Fast battery charging: (VOOC Flash Charge)   Oppo F3 Plus Price in Nepal: Rs. 54,990    Design:  The\xa0design of the Oppo F3 Plus seems to be inspired from that of Oppo R9s since it boosts the same metal-clad design with strip antenna bands on the back and chamfered lines along the front edges.         The phone looks intriguing from the front that has a huge display and thin borders. The device with rounded edges and curved back with smooth finish\xa0gives a premium feeling as soon as it lands on your palm. At the time of my review, I found it to be a little slippery. All in all, this is a well-built phone with bigger dimensions that more frequently asks you to use it with two hands instead of one.  On the right, it has the power button and the volume rockers are placed on the left. But I wouldn’t say they are well-placed since you have to really stretch your fingers to reach those buttons. These buttons are pretty tactile and give a nice feedback. On the bottom of the phone, are the loudspeaker, microUSB charging port, mic and the 3.5mm headphone jack. Below the display, are the capacitive buttons and in between them is placed the home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The sensor is pretty fast and accurate.  The Fingerprint scanner embedded in the home button of the Oppo F3s is fast and unlocks the phone in less than a second.  Display:  The phone comes with a\xa0big 6-inch display that comes with the resolution of 1920*1080 pixels. The display with 367ppi isn’t the sharpest but still, the color reproduction and viewing\xa0angles are noticeably\xa0impressive.  The Oppo F3s sports a big 6-inch display that comes with a full HD resolution.  It’s an LCD display that just looks as saturated as the OLED ones. Well, if the display with saturated colors falls in your liking, then this display won’t disappoint you. However, the phone doesn’t come with any display tuning options other than an option to filter the blue color, which can be disappointing to many. Unlike many other phone displays, this display was easy to look at even in direct sunlight. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and it does have a good touch response.  Performance:  Under the hood, the Oppo F3 Plus is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 which is the “Pro” version of the Snapdragon 652 that is claimed to be 10% more powerful than its predecessors. This OctaCore processor is backed by Adreno 510 GPU and is coupled with 4GB of RAM. Hence, the device is snappy fast and the performance was never an issue at the time of my review. The app loading and switching times were noticeably fast and the phone performed quite well even while playing graphics intensive games. But at times, the upper portion of the phone gets hot but that didn’t affect the performance of the phone. The phone offers 64GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 256GB.    Antutu Benchmark Score Higher is Better  Software/UI:  This device boots on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with Color OS 3.0 layered on top of it. The interface is exactly like that of any other Oppo phones. So, it’ll take time\xa0lesser time for IOS users than stock android users to get used to this interface. Other than that, the inclusion of tricks like swiping from the left or right bottom edge to the center of the phone for one hand usability seemed pretty handy. But there are times when the UI pushed me away, for instance, there are two different panels for quick settings and notifications.\xa0Just to take a peek at your notifications you’ve to follow two steps, swipe down the status bar and then swipe right to reach the notification panel. That is simply just clumsy.      Oppo F3 Plus UI ScreenShots   1  of 8                                                                                                  Camera:  Oppo F3 Plus houses a 16Megapixel rear shooter with f/1.7 aperture and is accompanied by dual-tone LED flash that performs impressively well even in low light conditions. The photos look well-detailed and the color reproduction is pretty close.  The camera app on the Oppo F3s is straight forward with options for HDR, Ultra HD photos, and manual control.  The camera focuses fast and I didn’t notice any shutter lags. The camera app is straight forward with options for HDR, Ultra HD photos, and manual control. With this phone, you can take 20burst photos at a time. The primary shooter is capable of taking 4K videos at 30fps. Sadly, there isn’t any option for slo-mo videos in this camera phone.      Primary (Rear) Camera Samples   1  of 6                                                                              Since it’s titled the “selfie expert”, the front dual cameras (8MP+16MP) are equally appealing as well. The 16MP unit has f2.0 aperture so the selfies from it come out detailed and bright. The second 8MP lens is a 120° wide angle one that lets you pack all your friends in one selfie. Hence, this selfie expert is suitable for taking selfies with the wider field of view. However, the photos taken using wide angle lens seem to have lots of grains in non-ideal lighting condition. There are options to shoot selfie time-lapse and panoramas as well. Like other Oppo phones, this too comes with beauty mode for the enhancement of the selfies. There are different options to apply filters and watermarks while taking the photo. Moreover, you can also take double exposure selfies from this phone.

Wi-Fi networks and mobile data were stable. I didn’t notice any call drops throughout my usage.\xa0The call quality was excellent, so was the audio coming out from 3.5mm headphone jack.  Battery:  The phone packs in 4000mAh battery that will easily last for a whole day even with heavy usage. Plus, the phone comes with VOOC fast charger that\xa0charged the phone impressively fast. I started charging the phone from 0% and it got charged up to 49% in 30mins and 89% in one hour. It took the phone 1hour and 31minutes to get fully charged.  The Oppo F3s packs in 4000mAh battery that will easily last for a whole day even with heavy usage.  Verdict:  Hence, the Oppo F3 plus, a capable camera phone, easily justifies its title of selfie expert. Other impressive features of this phone are its snappy fast fingerprint sensor and sound rich loudspeaker. However, Oppo could have made the phone a little more future proof by the inclusion of Android 7 Nougat and USB type C. Plus, the Snapdragon 653 is a powerful processor but isn’t as powerful as Snapdragon 821 that is powering the device of the same price range.  What I liked about Oppo F3 Plus (PROS):   Obviously, the first thing that easily impressed me is its dual selfie cameras. The 16MP unit on the front takes great selfies and performs well while video calling even in low light. The wide-angle 8MP selfie unit gave the sensation as if\xa0I was taking photos and videos not from a phone but from an action-cam.  The rear primary shooter\xa0easily addressed my mobile photography needs.  The display is bright and vivid and the white balance was on point.  The fingerprint scanner was snappy fast.   What I disliked about Oppo F3 Plus (CONS):   It’s 2017 and the phone neither comes with the Android 7 Nougat nor a USB Type-C.  It’s not like the Snapdragon 653 isn’t that powerful but it certainly isn’t as powerful as the Snapdragon 821 that is being used in a device that is available in the same price range.   If you are not impressed by Oppo F3 Plus, here are other devices that you might wanna consider:  Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro  Priced at Rs. 59,990, the Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro sports a 6-inch 1080P AMOLED display with 2.5D curved glass. It houses a 16MP, f/1.9 rear and 16MP,f/1.9 front cameras. The phone is powered by Snapdragon 653 processor, 6GB RAM, and 4000mAh battery. The device runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and is expected to get Nougat update very soon.

And in short, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is a beautiful looking device featuring an edge-to-edge display and a large screen on a smaller body.  [Note: The  Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus \xa0are now available in Nepal for  Rs. 76,900 and Rs. 86,900  respectively. You also get a 6-months breakage insurance on the purchase of the phone. Read more about the deal  here. \xa0]  Additionally, with every purchase of the S8 and the S8 plus, the customers will be getting  Breakage Insurance  from Shikhar Insurance and 8GB mobile data from Ncell. The Insurance will be valid for six months from purchase. And, the free mobile data will be available as 1GB each month for 8 months that can be activated on any ncell SIM.         Like I mentioned before, Samsung unveiled two versions of the Galaxy S8: the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+. The Galaxy S8 is the standard version among the two and sports a 5.8-inch display while the Galaxy S8+, the premium among the two, has a taller 6.2-inch display. On paper, 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch displays might sound a tad bit larger but the limited bezels have made the devices smaller than their predecessors, the  Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.   “The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ usher in a new era of smartphone design and fantastic new services, opening up new ways to experience the world,”  said DJ Koh, President of Mobile Communications Business, Samsung Electronics.  “The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are our testament to regaining your trust by redefining what’s possible in safety and marks a new milestone in Samsung’s smartphone legacy.”  DESIGN AND DISPLAY  The major selling point of the Samsung Galaxy S8 is its design and display. The device features what the Korean company has termed as the ‘Infinity Display’ which makes it looks as though the device has no side bezel at all. The curved display is a cherry on the top as it has made the device look really cool. The top and bottom bezel have been cut down as the display size has increased exponentially.   The standard Galaxy S8 features a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display with the resolution of 1440 x 2960 pixels (570 ppi) whereas the S8+ variant sports a 6.2-inch display with similar specifications ( the only difference being the 529 ppi).   The display is cloaked by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and the bottom of the display has a pressure-sensitive home button. The four corners of the device have slightly curved edges. On the back of both device sit a camera, a fingerprint sensor, a LED flash and a heart rate sensor. Samsung has opted to include its company branding only at the back. The back is made of up a glass panel. There are a speaker, a USB Type-C connector and a headphone jack at the bottom of the device. Samsung has also included a new physical button on the side which can be used to activate its new AI software Bixby. The device is IP68 water and dust resistant.  CAMERA  Both the S8 and the S8+ are equipped with a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with f/1.7 aperture and Optical Image Stabilization. At the launch event, the officials from Samsung emphasized on its ability to take excellent night shots.   The front-facing camera of the devices measures 8-megapixel. It has an Auto HDR feature, autofocus, and f/1.7 aperture.  Processor and Hardware  Qualcomm’s all new Snapdragon 835 SoC power the US variants whereas Exynos 8895 will power the international variants including Nepal. Nonetheless, both variants will have an Octa-core CPU that is aided by 4GB of RAM. I wanted Samsung to opt for 6GB of RAM but hey it comes with a 10nm processor that is exponentially better than its predecessor.   Both variants of the S8 will feature 64GB of internal storage which can be expanded up to 256GB via a microSD card slot.  An Iris scanner sits at the front of the device. It provides an extra security for the users. Other features include a super-fast face scanning, a fingerprint sensor, Accelerometer, Gyro, Heart rate and SpO2.  SOFTWARE AND BIXBY  The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ will run on Android v7.0 Nougat with Samsung’s own TouchWiz UI on top. While TouchWiz has been notoriously known to be a UI with lots of bloatware, the Korean Giants have done a great job to keep the UI in check.   Samsung is trying to compete with the Google Assistant and Siri with its all new personal virtual assistant named Bixby. Issuing voice commands to complete any objective is what the Bixby does. But unlike Google’s Assistant, the Bixby isn’t that intelligent and if far from an artificial intelligence.  List of Samsung Smartphone to get Nougat Update  BATTERY  One of the major drawbacks of the newly unveiled Samsung Galaxy S8 and the S8+ has to be the battery. The smaller one of the two, the Galaxy S8 houses a  3000 mAh battery  and the Galaxy S8+ houses a  3500 mAh battery . The battery in these devices will have to power up thousands and thousands of pixels every second. I haven’t been impressed with the battery the company went with. Maybe the battery saga of the Note 7 is why they went with a small battery. But on a flagship standard device, a buyer should not have to compromise on anything.   PRICING, RELEASE DATE AND AVAILABILITY  Both of the variants will be available for buying starting April 21. Samsung will start taking preorders from today. Buyers will get to choose from five color options in the international market: black, silver, blue, gold and gray.   In the US market, the pricing will depend on the carriers. \xa0It looks like an unlocked version of the S8 and S8 Plus might start from $720 and $840 respectively. As for their availability in Nepal, Samsung Nepal has launched Samsung Galaxy S8 and the S8+ in Nepal on April 19, 2017.

Rubin made headlines when it was announced that Essential Products, the company the co-founder of Android had created, was working on a new flagship smartphone.  Essential Products was started in 2014 and is rumored to be building a bezelless flagship smartphone. This news had come to light earlier this year. Fast forward a couple months and Rubin has shared a picture of the device on his Twitter. And boy, the end-to-end screen phone does look cool.  Taking a look at the picture, we can see a display and a not so bezelless design. There is a small bezel cloaking the screen. Also, it looks as though the device will feature the rounded edges everyone likes on the  LG G6 . If the rounded edges are forgotten, the device reminds me of the Xiaomi Mi Mix, which features excellent design and aesthetics.        The specifications of the device are still unknown as there aren’t many rumors floating around. It is, however, known that it will feature a modular system which works with the help of a proprietary magnetic connector. It could ship with a metal frame and a ceramic back for that extra protection every smartphone needs. Also, a rumor has mentioned that the device will feature a pressure-sensitive display, kind of like the recent iPhones.  Andy Rubin probably shared the picture to garner attention and ride the hype train. His attempt seems to have been a success as everyone at the tech world is excited to see the end product of this project.  Essential’s bezelless device won’t be the first smartphone to feature such a design. Sharp had implemented this concept on their Aquos Crystal, a smartphone that was launched nearly 3 years ago. Xiaomi had made headlines when it released the Mi Mix last year.  The Mi Mix is already available in Nepal for buying.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/andy-rubin-bezelless-smartphone.png']

Before you start doing the update, here are few things you need to consider. It’s because iOS 10.3 isn’t a mere update. This update is going to change the iOS file system from more than 30years old HFS+ to the new Apple File System (APFS).  List of the devices getting iOS 10.3  Here’s the list of the devices that will get iOS 10.3 update. But if your device already has iOS 10 then you needn’t check the list, your device will surely get the update.   iPhone 7/7 Plus  iPhone 6s/6s Plus  iPhone 6/6 Plus  iPhone SE  iPhone 5s  iPhone 5c  iPhone 5  iPad 4th gen  iPad Air  iPad Air 2  iPad Pro (12.9- and 9.7-inch)  iPad mini 2  iPad mini 3  iPad mini 4  iPod touch 6th   Things to Consider before the update:    Backup your data    Since with this update, Apple is changing the filesystem in the iPhones and iPads so there are chances for things to go wrong and you may end up losing your crucial data. So, it is wiser to create a back of the data in your phone before the update.        This new Apple File System brings a lot of improvements such as\xa0optimization for solid state storage, strong encryption and better file time stamping along with some storage saving features.  You can back up your data in two ways: using iCloud backup or iTunes backup. Just choose the one that you find handy.    Throw away “not used apps” and Update the “most used ones”    There are many apps on our phones that we don’t really use much. So, this is the right time to throw them away that will help to create more free spaces and there will be fewer data to be backed up.  If you haven’t updated your apps in a while, you should better do it now if they haven’t been automatically updated in the background. Many of the apps are now made compatible with the iOS 10 and later.    Make sure you still remember your iCloud password    After the update, you’ll need to log in to your iCloud account. So, it is better to make sure you remember your password. If you don’t just remember the password, just create a new one before the update.  FAQ  1. Is backing up the data mandatory?  No, it’s just for staying on the safe side. If you don’t prioritize your data much and don’t want the hassle of backing them up. Just go with the update with your finger crossed. Hopefully, things won’t go wrong and you’ll have the latest iOS on your device without losing any of your previous data.  2. Should I really clean my phone?  You shouldn’t bother much on cleaning the phone if it has iOS 9 or later. After iOS 9, the operating system will itself make the space needed, even by deleting apps and re-installing them afterward.  3. Should I update right now or wait few weeks?  Well, the best would be to wait a few weeks if you want to have the bugfree version of the iOS 10.3. The Apple releases bug fixes in few weeks following every release. So, the choice is all yours.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ios-10.3-update-in-Nepal.png']

Up front, it has capacitive navigation keys which have pretty wide sensing surface, so you won’t miss those touches even if you slightly miss the buttons marking, and this is important because the buttons aren’t backlit.        1  of 5                                                                    Display:  The Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime comes with a 5-inch Full HD display with the pixel density of 441ppi, that’s a lot of pixels for a 5-inch screen thus resulting in a sharp display. The screen is bright and saturated resulting in punchy colors. The viewing angles are great and I didn’t notice any color shifting.   The outdoor visibility is good as I could use the phone in direct sunlight without any issues. But when you open the camera on direct sunlight, you can hardly see anything on the screen, as it becomes really reflective at that time. But that’s not the issue here, the one and the only issue I had with the display are those thick black borders. These are pretty distracting at first, but with time you’ll forget about it, but, it’s still there. An edge-to-edge display would have made this device a whole lot better for the eyes.   Also, Xiaomi hasn’t included any kind of scratch protection in the display, so we suggest you snap a tempered glass once you buy the device.  Performance:  Coming down to performance, the Redmi 4 Prime is powered by Snapdragon 625 Octa-Core processor (Octa-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A53, 14nm Process) and coupled with that comes the Adreno 506 GPU. For normal daily usage, there’s nothing it can’t handle. Even with heavy usage, there were no hiccups with its performance. I was able to push the device per my usage without any issues. With 3GB of RAM, I was able to multitask between 5-6 apps without app restart and if you are concerned about the memory, there’s usually around 600MB of RAM free with loads of app open and 1.3 GB when cleared all of those.  Antutu Benchmark Comparison  On the Gaming Front, I could play high-end games like the Asphalt 8 and Modern Combat 5 at reasonable frame rates with no frame drops and lags anytime soon. Having said that, the phone does get warm on the back, but it’s nothing serious.  Software/UI:  The phone is running on MIUI 8.2 which is based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. I have favored stock android for a long time over any skinned UI, even MIUI before. But the new MIUI 8.2 seems completely refreshing, it is pleasing to the eyes, colors and icons look playful and there are just bunch of interactive animations which makes using the phone a whole lot fun.      Software Walk Though    1  of 6                                                                              But what makes MIUI fun is those little details incorporated all around the UI, like the Reading mode to cut off blue lights, double tap to wake up screen, app lock with fingerprint unlock, dual apps where you can use two same apps with different accounts, junk cleaner to clean cache and junk files, quick ball: an assistive touch that provides you with options of navigation & screenshot, three finger swipe for screenshot, and notification light customization where you can assign different colored light for different types of notification, lite mode to make things way too easy and to save the battery life, and the list goes on and on.  Camera:  Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime comes with 13MP Rear Camera with Phase Detection Auto Focus for faster autofocus, F2.2 aperture lens, and Dual tone Dual LED flash. The Camera UI is similar to other Xiaomi phones and comes with shooting options like panorama, scene, tilt-shift, Manual Mode and HHT or Hand-Held Twilight Mode for low light.   Images throughout the daytime were pretty okay and looked natural for the most part, but typically the images look warm, lacks sharpness and details and this was resolved to some extent by turning on HDR mode.      Camera Samples (Daylight)    1  of 3                                                Dynamic range is fine, but not excellent. During twilight, you can adjust the exposure by sliding up or down to get suitable lighting on your photos. At night time, the images come out all right with plenty of grains but turning on HHT mode helps to some extent. It can shoot Full HD videos at 30fps and it was terribly bad. With no image stabilization, you get really shaky videos with constant exposure shifts and they pretty much lacked details.      Camera Samples (Low Light)    1  of 2                                      The front facing 5MP Camera is okay, you get clean and clear photos in daylight and indoors but at night time it’s just full of grains.  Connectivity:  For Connectivity, the phone comes with dual SIM slot, where the 2nd slot supports Micro SD Card extendibility. Wi-Fi networks and data was stable and I had no problems while calling. And on top, it also comes with an IR-Blaster and a supporting Mi Remote App which is pretty handy simple and straight forward. The call quality was excellent, so was the audio coming out from 3.5mm headphone jack.   Fingerprint Sensor:  Redmi 4 Prime has a fingerprint sensor on the back which is very fast, it instantaneously unlocks the phone. Besides unlocking the phone, the fingerprint sensor can also assist in taking photos and app lock. I typically like fingerprint sensor up front, as it is easier to unlock the phone while it’s on the table but when held on hand, the back is where your fingers normally rest enabling easier access.   Battery:  The battery on the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime\xa0is one of the best feature. The 4100mAh battery lasted for 2 days of heavy usage. From taking photos & videos to playing games and chatting all day long, the Redmi 4 Prime can go on and on.  Talking about the screen on time, I got somewhere around 7 to 8 hours, as the battery optimization is great on the MIUI and the phone uses a power efficient 14nm Snapdragon 625 SoC. If you want to extend the life further you can either turn on battery saver or the lite mode.  It took almost 3 hours to completely charge the device even though it has fast charging capabilities.  Verdict:  It isn’t often that a midrange comes with a short list of flaws and Redmi 4 Prime is one of those phones. So during my period of review, these are the things I liked and disliked about the Redmi 4 Prime.  WHAT I LIKED ABOUT XIAOMI REDMI 4 PRIME:   The first and foremost thing is undoubtedly the battery life. It feels amazing to be carefree about your battery life when it lasts for two whole days.  Then comes the premium design. Although I was carrying a sub 25k phone, I never doubted for a second it was any less premium than the flagship phones. Also, the compact size of the phone makes it really portable and easy to use.  The display is sharp, bright, and has good contrast.  The performance, even with SD 625, I wasn’t limited to just basic use and could go overboard and do some high-end power use with it. The addition of fingerprint sensor is a boon and the MIUI has pretty great ways to make more use of it.   WHAT I DISLIKED ABOUT XIAOMI REDMI 4 PRIME:   Loudspeaker is average  The display has black borders which could be really distracting.  The display lacks\xa0scratch resistant glass and hence scratches easily.  Poor video quality along with average image quality (considering the price)   IF YOU WEREN’T IMPRESSED BY THE XIAOMI REDMI 4 PRIME, HERE ARE SOME OTHER OPTIONS YOU CAN CONSIDER:  ZTE Axon Mini \xa0  Priced at Rs. 25,999, the Axon Mini sports a 5.2-inch 1080P AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 3 protection and forced touched display. It houses a 13MP rear and 8MP front cameras. It is powered by an older octacore Snapdragon 616 processor, 3GB RAM, and 2800mAh battery. It is running on an outdated Android 5.1 Lollipop.  SAMSUNG GALAXY J5 PRIME  Another great device in Redmi 4 Prime’s price range, the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime comes with a better 13MP shooter. It is currently available at Rs. 22,990 and sports a lower resolution 720P display, quad-core CPU, and only 2GB of RAM.  Also Read:\xa0 Top Phones Under Rs. 30,000']",[]

The Intel’s new computer memory has hit the market with the name “Optane SSD DC P4800X”. The first product of such kind has the memory capacity of 375GB that is priced at $1520. But this is currently limited in numbers and the availability is kind of limited as well. But the availability and the storage capacity is expected to go bigger with time.  Intel 3D XPoint Technology: What is known so far  This new computer memory from Intel is based on Intel’s 3D XPoint\xa0– pronounced as “Three-Dee-Cross-Point” technology. Intel has been keeping secrets on the 3D XPoint technology as they don’t want others to duplicate their innovation. So, there’s so less to share about how the system is made and how it works.  To give an overview, this computer memory comprises the best of both the memory types: the SSD and the DRAM. So, it can be used as both the memory and the storage. According to Intel, this memory is 1000 times faster than traditional hard drives and can pack data 10 times more densely than traditional DRAMs.        However, to unleash its real power, such computer memory is calling for the new computer architecture. Intel says it is already working with Big companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft to help them design new computer architecture and operating system that works the best with Intel 3D XPoint.  Verdict  Intel’s betting big with this new breakthrough in computer memory technology.\xa0But it’s not us, the general users, that Intel’s targeting at. It’s the big cloud-based companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. So, this might be the memory type today’s data centers are looking forward to.

Followers of our page text us asking about smartphones of these brands. But we usually don’t suggest them to buy smartphones from those brands. We don’t have any hatred against Google, Motorola or LG. It’s just that these smartphones aren’t officially available here in Nepal.  Read More:   Price of all smartphones in Nepal  Why should that matter, you ask? Well, simply because you can’t claim any warranty if you buy these products. Drop your phone once and you will have to empty your pocket in an instant.        Take Huawei and Samsung as examples. These companies have a broad presence in the Nepali smartphone market. Their smartphones are available for buying through official channels. So, if you buy a defective smartphone or have any software issues, the service centers of these companies will happily repair your unit through official technicians, or even replace it with a new one.        1  of 3                                                Take this as an example: a friend of mine had to pay over Rs, 15,000 for replacing her Xiaomi Mi3 display a while back. Note that this was the time when the smartphone wasn’t officially available in Nepal.  Buying smartphones from the grey market should be avoided as well. Smartphone manufacturers never honor warranty offers of devices that have been brought into a country via illegal means or via unofficial channels. So, you’ll end up having to pay loads of money for a simple repair of your device. Some service centers even refuse to mend devices if the fact that a smartphone was bought illegally comes into light.  [Note: Please stop buying anything from the grey market. While it might seem like you have saved a few bucks, on a long run it could haunt you. Grey marketers sell refurbished or previously used smartphones claiming they are new.]  Yes, sometimes we face a bit of a hustle when the phone we just bought gives up on us. But hey, at least we have a void warranty that covers the cost of its repair.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Xiaomi-service-centre.jpg']
['CG Blaze 4G Review: A Budget 4G Phone That Fails to Impress'],"['CG', 'Reviews']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 26, 2017']",2017-03-26 07:46:02+00:00,"['It’s been a while since NTC launched the 4G service in selected cities of Nepal. Now, while buying your new phone you should also consider if it supports 4G network or not. Past few days, we searched in the market for the cheapest 4G phone to buy. And, what we found is the CG Blaze 4G that is priced at  Rs.11,111 . So, let’s get to know what\xa0the phone offers and should you buy it or skip it?  Design        1  of 4                                                          CG Blaze 4G does come in premium packaging but the phone looks and feels cheap. The design looks to be inspired from the phones that were released like 5 years ago. So, this plastic build phone failed to impress us with its outdated design.  Display         Coming to the display, the phone has a 5inch 720p display. On paper, that sounds pretty good but in real life use, the display is truly disappointing. Though the phone comes with display tuning options but no settings can make the display look pleasing to the eyes. The more you tilt, the more color shifting you can notice. It’s not just the colors but even the touch is not so sensitive. Be it swiping\xa0on the home screen or dragging the notification bar, the touch seemed to have issues every so often. And, when it comes to display’s visibility under direct sunlight, the phone is better in your pocket. This diplay just can’t take the sunlight at all.  Performance   This phone is powered by MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor coupled with 2GB of RAM. So, if there’s anything that I didn’t have the issue with this phone then that’s the performance. The app loading and switching time were fast enough. During the time of my review, I played True Skate on it and the gaming performance was satisfactory. Moreover, Had it had a dedicated app switching button, the multitasking experience would have been even better.  On the memory side, it has 16GB of storage and along with two SIM slots, it has dedicated microSD card slot that will accept cards of up to 64GB.  Camera   In the back, it has 8 Megapixel auto focus primary unit with LED flash. The primary shooter can shoot videos of up to 720p at 30fps. The camera performance seems to be on par with its pricing. What I liked the most about its camera is the option to lock the object. The photos taken in HDR mode seemed to stand out from those taken in regular mode.      CG Blaze 4G Camera Samples   1  of 6                             Selfie With Beauty Mode On         Regular Selfie                HDR Photo                              The 5 Megapixel selfie camera isn’t any good. However with beauty mode on and in good lighting condition you can manage to get few considerable selfies. Most of the time, the selfies come with lots of grains and lack in details.  Software   The phone boots on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with CG’s UI layered on top of it. The UI isn’t that far off from the stock android. But the touch issues are there which I’m pretty sure are due to the display but that makes you feel if the UI isn’t responsive or something. There are different gesture functions available but they are better turned off or you’ll notice the battery draining much faster than it should.      CG Blaze 4G UI (Screenshots)   1  of 7                                                                                        Battery  The phone houses a removable 2000mAh battery which had a\xa0hard time giving me the battery life worth a full day. The average screen on time I could manage to get from this phone is of 2 to 3 hours. However, the phone does have a good stand-by, though. But charging the device is super slow. It took me around 3hours to charge the phone from 0 to 100%.      CG Blaze 4G Battery Performance   1  of 4                                                          Connectivity  Now coming to the connectivity, it has a 4G right on its name and after inserting a 4G SIM, it displays the 4G right along the network bar. The phone has stable and fast internet connectivity while using mobile data. So, if it’s just the 4G connectivity that you prioritize the most then you can never go wrong with this phone.  Verdict   To conclude, the CG Blaze 4G does do justice to the tag “4G” in its name. However, the phone cannot be considered to be a good buy. It’s all because of its ugly design language and terrible display. The display on a smartphone is what matters the most. So, a phone with a bad display can never be considered a good phone.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4T3A9795.jpg']

Gionee A1 is the flagship phone of the company for the year 2017.\xa0So, it obviously comes with decent specs (minus the processor) and has managed to be in a price range of mid-ranger.

Its availability in Nepal just after a month of international launch is admirable. Unlike many other Chinese phones that get overpriced just after landing in Nepal, this phone has become an exception that is priced just right, maybe that’s because of offline sales.  Plus, the pre-bookers getting a free JBL GO speaker is an added benefit. Kudos to Gionee Nepal and Sastodeal for bring such offer to the Nepali customers.

['Why should this brand come to Nepal?'],['Opinion'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['March 25, 2017']",2017-03-25 03:21:02+00:00,"['Nepali technology market is booming at an alarming rate and it is good to see that mobile market is one of the top sectors. Ever so often, we see new brands entering in Nepal, mainly of Chinese origin which leaves us with plenty of options to search through all the phones that fit our requirement. It’s a good thing that these brands we are hearing for the first times are entering the market but what about the brands that we know well and really want in the market? I know most of us will agree on this that Motorola is the missing puzzle in the Nepali mobile market! With almost all the major brands in Nepal, we’re missing the Moto goodness that the rest of the world is enjoying.  Motorola has been really innovative and for the past three years has been making the best budget phone for every year, the Moto G Lineup! Even this year’s  Moto G5  looks somewhat certain to take that title as well. Moto X lineup is long gone now with the start of the Z Series, and the  Moto Z  itself is the best future proof phone in my opinion with all the  Moto Mods  that is being made for the device.  Reasons to Buy Motorola Smartphones:  1.Stock Android:         If you’re a true android fanatic, you’ll know the joy of stock android on your device. Ever since the original Moto G and Moto X, people have admired the use of stock android on the Moto devices. Even with minimal resources, stock android optimization can make your device faster than what you get over flavored UI with same specifications. And not having to deal with a bunch of pre-installed crap is a relief! Stock android is light on your memory so your RAM gets plenty of breathing space for better multitasking as well.  2. Updates:  Source:Amaziness.net  One thing that every android devices suck at, is getting a software update. While an old iPhone keeps getting every update that the new iPhone 7’s get, most android users are carrying a month old device that is likely to never come across any word as “update.” But luckily for Motorola users, an update is something they aren’t deprived of. Every Moto phones are bound to get android updates for up to 2 years. Even my old Moto G2 got version upgrade from 4.4 to 5.0 then 5.1 to 6.0 which was pretty awesome. For two years, I got to enjoy all the amazing features that every new update brought. Motorola phones are also one of the first phones to receive android updates besides the  Pixel devices . If not a version upgrade, they keep getting regular security patches which is a great thing.  3.Moto Gestures:   OEM’s have been trying to add a lot of features to their device to ease up its usability. Double tap to wake up and gestures on the lock screen to launch different apps is something that is great to have, but with Moto Gestures, you’re taking convenience to a whole new level.  Chop-Chop to Turn ON flashlight is a life-saver. Without having to unlock the phone and fire up flashlight app, you can simply turn ON or Off the flashlight with a swing of your hand. And the double twist to launch the camera app makes it easy to capture images on the move. These gestures available on Moto’s mid-range series has been adopted in Pixel devices as well, which are well over $700 devices. Also, Ambient Display is a\xa0neat feature that lets you peek into your notifications and lights up to show time when you hold the device.  4.Value for Money:   We often avoid getting ripped off while buying a smartphone. No one wants to buy a phone and regret later. For a definite amount, we want all the best features that could be crammed into the device. People are picky when selecting a smartphone, they want a balance between all the essentials like sharp display, good camera, durable battery life, snappy performance and something more, something like the Moto Gestures! For me, Motorola checks all of these aforementioned areas. Moto devices are priced reasonably well on the international markets and if priced right, there’s nothing that will stop Motorola from ruling the Nepali Mobile market.  Motorola is now a\xa0subsidiary of Lenovo. Lenovo already has an official distributor in Nepal and I think it’s about time that they look beyond Lenovo phones and bring some Moto goodness for Nepali users.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Why-should-this-brand-come-to-Nepal.png']

Even though the Lava A3 Mini is a miniature version of the A3, it packs quite decent specifications in an affordable cost. Talking about specifications, the A3 Mini comes with a 5.0-inch IPS display with the resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels and pixel density of 294 ppi. This display is covered by Panda Glass and its edges end in a 2.5D Arc Glass which has made the device look seamless all over. Design wise, the Lava A3 Mini comes packed in a metallic body made of aluminum alloy. It features a special violin neck design.         Under the hood, the Lava A3 Mini is powered by a 64-bit Quad-core MediaTek 6737T processor that has a clock speed of 1.5 GHz. The device features Mali T720 as its GPU. On the storage front, it comes with 16GB of internal storage and 2GB of RAM. There is an option for expanding the internal storage up to 64GB. Probably the best thing about the Lava A3 Mini is the fact that it runs on Android v7.0 Nougat. The inclusion of Google’s newest operating system is a surprise, but a much-welcomed addition. Star OS 4.0 runs on top of Android Nougat.  For the photography lovers, the Lava A3 Mini packs a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera with Sony IMX 258 sensor and f/2.0 aperture lens. It is accompanied by a single tone flash for better color reproduction in pictures. The front-facing camera measures 5-megapixel with a single LED flash. It features f/2.2 aperture.

Sensors on the device include proximity, accelerometer and light sensor among others.   A non-removable 2700 mAh Li-Polymer battery backs up the device for its functioning.

For those looking forward to buying Mi Note 2, pre-booking the phone at the price of NRs. 76,999 will help them get a free Mi band 2 worth Rs. 4,499.  Xiaomi Mi Note 2: Specs Breakdown  Xiaomi Mi Note 2 is a really good looking lad with 5.7inch FULL HD Super AMOLED display with curved edges. Under the hood, the phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, backed by Adreno 530 GPU and is coupled with humongous 6GB LPDDR4 RAM. On the storage side, it has non-expandable storage of 128GB based on UFS 2.0 technology. Coming to the cameras, it has 22.5 MP, f/2.0 primary camera unit with phase detection auto-focus accompanied by dual tone flash.

But it’s availability this late and with such heavy pricing in which the next Galaxy,  the Galaxy S8 , might be available, I don’t think I can suggest someone buy this phone. The best would be to wait a little longer and buy the next galaxy instead. Yes, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 is a good phone but the S8 will certainly be better in many different ways. Moreover, the Mi Note 2 does win in the design part but in specs-to-specs comparison, it is pretty close to  OnePlus 3T . So, if it’s the specs you’re after, just buy the OnePlus 3T and save your hard earned money.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/xiaomi-mi-note-2-in-nepal.png']
['OPPO F3 Plus Price in Nepal'],"['OPPO', 'Reviews']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 23, 2017']",2017-03-23 07:12:33+00:00,"['Chinese handset maker Oppo has launched  Oppo F3 Plus  globally including Nepal. Telecell Pvt. Ltd, the importer of  Oppo mobiles in Nepal , has priced the OPPO F3 Plus for Rs. 54,990. You may head to OPPO’s retail outlets to avail the smartphones.  OPPO F3 Impressions:\xa0  If there’s anything that the youth loves more than social media, it’s clicking selfies. The selfie obsession has reached a fever pitch, so much so, that each time you walk into a public spot, you’ll find yourself surrounded by hundreds of pout face and smirks. So, now companies like Oppo has also brought their dual Selfie camera. Wait, Lots more, let’s start the early impression review of this phone.         BUILD  The Oppo F3 Plus\xa0is a pretty big phone and that is kind of obvious with the tag “Plus” on its name. The design is nothing innovative. On the right, it has the power button and the volume rockers are placed on the left. These buttons are pretty tactile and give a nice feedback. On the button are the loudspeaker, microUSB charging port, mic and the 3.5mm headphone jack. Below the display, are the capacitive buttons and in between them is placed the home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The sensor is pretty fast and accurate. It can be easily said that it is a\xa0well-built metal phone with chamfered edges that feels good on the hands as soon as it lands on your palm.  Below the display screen, are the capacitive buttons and in between them is placed the home button that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The\xa0sensor is pretty fast and accurate. It can be easily said that it is a\xa0well-built metal phone with chamfered edges that feels good on the hands as soon as it lands on your palm.   DISPLAY  The Oppo F3 Plus sports a 6 inch full HD display that has a good color reproduction. Addition to that the white balance is spot\xa0on. That may be the reason the manufacturer hasn’t given much of display tweaking options other than the brightness setting and an option to filter the blue color. During our first impression, it was observed the display changing the viewing angles to the extreme and still, the color shifting was not so noticeable. Addition to that, the side bezels are pretty thin as well.   PERFORMANCE  Under the hood, this device is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 653 which is the “Pro” version of the Snapdragon 652. The Snapdragon 652 has been claimed to be 10% more powerful than its predecessors. This OctaCore processor is backed by Adreno 510 GPU and is coupled with 4GB of RAM. From the start of my use of the phone, the device is snappy fast and the performance was never an issue during the time of the review.   On the storage size, the phone comes with 64GB of Onboard storage. If it sounds not sufficient enough, you may expand it using a microSD card of up to 256GB in its hybrid SIM tray.  CAMERA  The Oppo F3 Plus is the latest addition to the Oppo’s F line up of Selfie Experts so the real hype is all about its dual cameras on the front. This dual camera setup for the selfies is 16 Megapixel and 8 Megapixel. The 16 Megapixel unit has an f1.7 aperture that aids in taking better selfies even in low-light. And, the 8megapixel unit is a wide-angle one that will come handy when you want to pack all your friends into one selfie.   On the back, it has a single 16 Megapixel shooter with an f1.7 aperture that is accompanied by dual-tone LED flash. This primary camera unit performs comparatively well in low-light photography as well. The regular photos come out to be impressive as well. But the video capability tops out at 1080p, so no 4K recording from this camera phone.  SOFTWARE AND OTHER FEATURES  This device boots on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with Color OS 3.0 layered on top of it. The interface is exactly like that of any other Oppo phones. So, it’ll take time\xa0lesser time for IOS users than stock android users to get used to this interface. Other than that, the inclusion of tricks like swiping from the left or right bottom edge to the center of the phone for one hand usability seemed pretty handy.             CONNECTIVITY AND SENSORS  The phone supports Oppo’s VOOC fast charging technology and the 4 Amp charger comes with the phone itself. This dual SIM phone has all the essential sensors and does support OTG. But to know how good the battery is, we’ve to spend more time on the phone. \xa0That will be\xa0certainly covered in our next full review of the phone.  So how do we feel about Oppo F3 Plus?  To conclude, the Oppo F3 plus looks promising\xa0with a\xa0good display, great cameras, and powerful configuration. Keeping\xa0high hopes on this device, we are eager to find out if it lives up to that expectation. For few weeks it will be used as a daily driver and will come up with a full review.

The Japanese Giant has earned a patent which has mentioned about a technology that can charge any smartphone when it comes in contact with another through a connectivity mean.  Wireless charging has started to become a common feature in most of the smartphones. Nokia started this concept in 2012. Fast-forward a few years, and global brands like LG, Google and Samsung have already implemented this technology in their smartphones.        And now, in 2017, Sony has plans to take this technology a little bit further as it is trying to charge Consumer Electronic device with another one.  The patent has mentioned the use of dual antennae system that could allow data transfer or power transfer between two consumer electronic devices.  An image illustrating two smartphones show how they can transfer power with each other.   The patent describes how the first antenna band in a device can connect to the second antenna band in another device. These devices connect via NFC (Near Field Communication), a technology that is a common feature of smartphones these days. Through the NFC chip, the electronic devices will be able to connect with another device featuring a similar type of antenna band.  “The system provides a graphical user interface to illustrate each of the identified antenna systems, and receives user instructions corresponding to at least two of the identified antenna systems, to generate configuration instructions in accordance with the user instructions, and to configure selected CE devices in accordance with the configuration instructions”, the patent mentions.   The patent hasn’t exactly mentioned the types of devices that can use this technology, but has instead termed ‘portable consumer electronic devices’.  So, if implemented correctly, this technology could be used to power devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets, among others, via similar devices.  We need to understand that just because a patent has been filed, that doesn’t necessarily mean the concept will come to life sometime in the near future.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wireless-power-transfer-tech.png']

The OnePlus X gets a new pricing of  Rs. 21,700\xa0 and that is Rs. 7,000 lesser than its previous price tag. Well, that’s what we would like to call a massive price drop.  Should you buy the discounted OnePlus X?  The same question if asked before this price cut would be a hard one to answer. But now with this new pricing, the OnePlus X is totally worth all your money. The 5inch screen phone comes with Full HD AMOLED display whereas most of the phones in this price range will ask you to settle with just an HD LCD display. Plus, the smaller dimension phone gives a good one hand usability. The phone is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 both on the front and the back and there’s metal frame along the edges. Under the hood, the OnePlus X is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. If you don’t know, it’s the same configuration as in Sony Xperia Z3. So, the phone is arguably a powerful one. Though the device boots on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, it is upgradeable to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.         The phone’s 16GB inbuilt storage might sound a little short when many devices these days are offering 32GB. But hey, the storage is expandable up to\xa0256GB via microSD card in its hybrid SIM tray. The cameras are well just of average performance as that’s what  our review  says but now in this price range, the 13MP unit on the back and 8 MP on the front sound competitive enough. The only considerable downside is its inclusion of 2525mAh battery that doesn’t give an outstanding battery life.

It’s the fourth Oppo smartphone to launch in Nepal after the company unveiled  A37, Neo 7, and F1s  in September.\xa0Now you can buy Oppo A57 in Nepal for the price of Rs.26,500.  [Update: The Oppo A57 is now available for Rs.24,990]  Oppo A57: What’s Inside?  Oppo A57 is a 5.2inch LCD screen phone that has the resolution of 720*1280pixels (HD). Under the hood, the phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 OctaCore CPU clocked at 1.4GHz and is backed by Adreno 505 GPU.

Opting for Oppo A57, one has to make a lot\xa0of sacrifices. The biggest sacrifice is settling for a lower display resolution which is an only HD one. If you are spending 26k on a phone, I think it’ll be wiser to spend some extra and buy phones like  Huawei GR5 2017 ,  Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ,  Coolpad Cool1 dual  or even  OnePlus 2  that will rather be a better daily driver. That said, yes Oppo A57 comes with a good selfie unit but is taking selfies the only use for a smartphone? Well, the answer is “No”. So, if you are a selfie manic then only buying a phone like this can be considered a wiser decision or else just look around, there are many better devices available at same\xa0or near to price range.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oppo-a57.png']

['5 Reasons NOT to Buy Oppo F1s'],['OPPO'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 21, 2017']",2017-03-21 11:31:35+00:00,"['When it comes to buying a phone, it is always the hardest to choose the right one. What happens with many of us is we buy first and think later. Usually, we buy a phone after seeing its advertisements on daily newspapers and ask the salesperson about the phone. He or she’s \xa0the salesperson, they are there to sell so just avoid them. That’s the reason, we end up regretting and asking ourselves “Why did I even buy this phone?”. There are different ways of finding a right phone and the safest way is to first filter out the wrong ones. So, if you have a budget of around 30K and thinking about buying your next phone, here’s why you should buy any other phones but not the Oppo F1s.  5 Reasons NOT to buy Oppo F1s at Rs. 32,000  Though recently the Oppo F1s (4GB/64GB) is available at the same price the 3GB/32GB variant was available few months back, it still doesn’t make the device worth buying. Here are the 5 reasons you should not buy Oppo F1s in Nepal:  1. Lesser\xa0Display Resolution  Oppo F1s is a 5.5inch screen phone that comes with only 720p(HD) display giving the 267ppi which is not so impressive for a device in this price range. It’s the only device with HD screen in this price range. Yes, the display is pretty vibrant and everything but 30 thousand for just an HD screen phone? Well, that doesn’t just sound right.        2. Outdated OS  We have been hearing a lot about Oppo F1s getting\xa0an update but it never did and we think, it never will. So, Oppo F1s boots on pretty outdated Android 5.1 Lollipop. So buying this phone you’ll be missing quite some tricks like “doze” mode and “Google Now on Tap”. If latest android is what you want on your phone, then you should check  Android One GM 5plus  that runs on pure Android Nougat and comes at just 25,000.  3. Not so powerful Chipset  A\xa0Phone is all about performance and performance is defined by the processor used in it. So, can you expect powerful performance from a chipset like MediaTek MT6750 that falls short when compared to processors like Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 and Qualcomm SnapDragon 652 that power  OnePlus 2  and  Coolpad Cool 1  Dual.  4.\xa0Really a Camera Phone?  The cameras look pretty good in numbers and on paper but when used they are not so exceptional. The 16megapixel selfie unit on the front doesn’t have an autofocus but a fixed focus. If you’re giving a phone the title “Selfie Expert” but don’t use a unit with autofocus then that will just not gonna work out. Coming to the rear camera, it’s a 13MP unit with no OIS that doesn’t even shoot a 4K video. So for a phone to be true Camera Phone we want it to offer something more, something extra and Oppo F1s failed to impress us here too.  5. Lesser Value for Money  Now, when choosing the best phone what we do is compare and comparing Oppo F1s with phones in similar price range, the phone is found offering less and asking more. Oppo F1s doesn’t have a gyro sensor and dual band WiFi module. Even just on doing Specs-to-Specs comparison the phone is far away from good value for money. The phone with lower display resolution, lesser powerful chipset and outdated OS with not so innovative UI is simply a “lesser value for your money”.  Disclaimer:  We made this decision after using the phone for 15days. And, it is truly our personal opinion. You may anytime agree to disagree. But, the facts are always there to stay.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oppof1s.png']
['Samsung’s new AI assistant “Bixby” will debut on its next Galaxy (S8/S8+)'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 21, 2017']",2017-03-21 08:39:34+00:00,"['Right from the rise of smartphones, users adapted the touch interface as the primary way of interacting with a phone. Things started to change after big names in phone industry introduced their own AI-powered assistants one after another. Now, Google’s Assitant, Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana are doing good already. The voice-powered Samsung’s S-voice was seriously lagging far behind in the competition\xa0and who could realize that more than the Samsung itself. Finally, Samsung has made its new AI-assistant “Bixby” now official. It will make its debut on the next Galaxy and that’s Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 plus. However, Bixby will come pre-installed on future Samsung phones and home appliances as well.  What makes Bixby different than its competitors?  On a blog post , Samsung made its new AI-powered agent the Bixby official and mentioned how it differs from its competitors. To release a whole new voice-assistant on a phone, Samsung certainly needed to offer more than what are currently available. Looking at the blog post, Samsung does seem to deliver\xa0more on its new AI assistant that has three key properties:  1. Completeness  In any Bixby-enabled apps, the\xa0user will be able to perform any tasks, one could do using the touch interface, just by using his/her voice.        2. Context Awareness  Just like Now on Tap, Bixby can read what’s on your screen and will help you carry out your current work-in-progress. Plus, Bixby can be called any time just with a click of a button and it will let the\xa0user switch between voice or touch seamlessly.  3. Cognitive Tolerance  Unlike current AI assistants that need\xa0users to use specific voice commands in preset formats, Bixby is intelligent enough to understand the user’s intention even in incomplete voice commands. It will try to make the best out of the spoken words and will make further queries as and per needed.  According to Samsung, Bixby is capable of doing much more than its competitors. It will just not facilitate searches and answer fact-based questions. Rather, it will learn and adapt to the user and his/her intentions. It will redefine the way one interacts with the phone. Having an assistant that is capable of performing any tasks that are only possible with touch is truly praiseworthy.  However, the Bixby will be limited to Bixby-enabled apps that will come pre-installed with the next galaxy. However, as Samsung is planning to release the SDK for the third-party developers. The number of Bixby-enabled apps will certainly increase with time. The Galaxy S8/S8 plus will have a dedicated button on the left side of the device to wake this assistant.  Verdict  Well, this AI assistant from Samsung, or should I say the agent as that’s what Samsung wants us to say, looks promising. The best part is Bixby to be integrated with every future Samsung products. So, I would love to see Samsung Home appliances coming with such powerful AI agent like the Bixby. Such integration is certainly going to redefine the way human interacts with a\xa0machine. We, no longer, will have to rely on touch interfaces for controlling our appliances. Plus, if things go as planned, you can ask your phone to change the channel on your Samsung TV. And, you can ask your Samsung Fridge to add milk to your shopping list on your phone when you realize your fridge ran out of milk.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Samsung-Bixby.png']

It hasn’t been a month since these phones were announced and Sony already has another one in the pipeline, the Xperia L1 which is the successor of Xperia L launched way back in 2013.  Xperia L1  is a mid-ranger which comes with a 5.5inch 720p display which could be a bummer for many users. On the bright side, it has got the design of Xperia XA and XA Ultra making it look premium.

['JBL E45BT and JBL E55BT: Your Next Wireless Headphones?'],['Reviews'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 20, 2017']",2017-03-20 06:13:38+00:00,"['We looked for premium yet affordable wireless headphones in the market\xa0of Nepal and found these two JBL headphones: JBL E45BT and JBL E55BT. After using those headphones for a couple of weeks, here’s what we think about these two headphones. Let’s find out if they are worth buying or not.  Design  Being from the same E-series headphones from JBL, they share a similar design and pretty similar specs. Where they differ is the E45BT is an on-ear headphone whereas E55BT is an over-ear one. So, E55BT is little bigger and obviously a little heavier and packs the bigger 50mm dynamic driver and a bigger battery. They differ in pricing as well since you can grab the E45BT at 12,500 and the E55BT is priced a little higher at 15,800.         Both the headphones have soft and well-fitting leather padding on the earcups. The adjustable headband covered with fabric is as comfortable as it looks. The ear-cups can have 90 degrees of the rotation making it lay flat over the chest while wearing around the neck. And for easy carrying around, the headphones are foldable. However, the carrying pouch is not included in the box and needs to be bought separately.  Controls  Coming to the controls, the right earcup has all the controls and the buttons give satisfying click sound. The controls include power button, music control buttons and the Bluetooth button. These music control buttons are multi-functional ones as you can switch to the next or previous song by long pressing the volume up or volume down button. And in the case of incoming calls, you can answer it by pressing the play/pause button. I answered few calls through the headphone and the experience was pretty neat.  Connectivity  The Bluetooth connection was pretty decent. I left my phone on charge in one room and walked around another listening to music and I didn’t notice any skipping at all.   Performance  Coming to the performance, these JBL headphones didn’t let me down in their overall performances. Since they are from JBL, they have pretty dope bass and the vocals sound crisp with much clarity. They do handle mids and lows well enough. But the headphones crack a little when on full volume. But wait, who’s gonna put their headphones to the maximum, right? So, in overall, the headphone can be said to be a good performer for the music of any genre.  Battery  I’ve become a crazy fan of these headphones for their battery backup. You know what, I listened to the E55BT for a whole week with an average listening time of 3 hours each day before I plugged the headphone to the power for the first time. Again, after two hours of charging, the headphone gave me 19-20hours of music playback, which is simply awesome. And, the smaller E45BT has a lesser playback time of around 15-16hours. The box doesn’t include charging brick but only the charging cable that will work with your phone’s charging adapter. The box also comes with 3.5mm aux cable for wired use. That’ll come handy when the device loses its battery completely or when your music playback device doesn’t support Bluetooth.      JBL Wireless Headphones 2017   1  of 5                                                                    Conclusion  To conclude, if you have a budget of around 15,000 and wanna buy some premium headphones then you won’t regret buying any of these headphones. As far as my preference is concerned, I think the best would be to buy the JBL E55BT which is an over-ear headphone that is more comfortable to ears and it has lesser music leak. And going with the bigger headphone, you’ll get to enjoy longer and a little better music playback as well.']",[]

['Coolpad Cool1 Dual Review: A great value proposition'],"['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 17, 2017']",2017-03-17 16:01:22+00:00,"['Coolpad Cool1 Dual, the first phone that was manufactured in a joint venture of Coolpad and LeEco is now officially available in Nepal for the price of Rs.31000. I’ve used this handset (with dual cameras and 4060mAh battery) for a couple of weeks and here’s what I have to say about the device. Let’s find out if this dual camera phone is what it claims to be? You can follow the review to find out if Coolpad Cool1 Dual can be your next daily driver?  [Note: Th Coolpad Cool 1 is priced at MRP 31,000, but it is available for users for around Rs. 29,500]\xa0  Build   The Coolpad Cool1 Dual is a metal build phone that doesn’t have much of uniqueness to stand out the crowd. The Chamfered edges do make the device look classy but while using the phone the absence of 2.5D glass is felt every so often. Other than that, this 8.2mm thick phone that weighs 167gm feels sturdy while holding. It has capacitive buttons on the chin that are backlit. On the bottom edge is the USB Type-C port for charging in the middle of the speaker and the mic. The metal build volume rockers and power buttons are placed on the right edge. On top, you can find the 3.5mm headphone jack alongside the IR sensor. Dual cameras and fingerprint sensor are placed on the back of the phone. The fingerprint sensor is a bit shiny that makes the smudges look noticeable more than ever.        Display   The phone has a corning gorilla glass 3 protected 5.5 inch IPS LCD display with the resolution of 1920*1080 pixels. The display with 450nits brightness and 72% NTSC color gamut is nothing to complain about considering the price except those thick bezels around it. The outdoor visibility of this display was just average, nothing too exciting or too disappointing. The color reproduction and viewing angles are satisfactory. But personally, I found the white balance to be a little warmer than need. However, every time I looked into the display, I couldn’t get my eyes off those thick black bezels.  Performance   As someone’s daily driver, this phone is an impressive performer since it is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 Octacore processor backed by Adreno 510GPU. This processor has four powerful Cortex A72 cores and four power efficient cortex A53 cores. That has made this device both powerful and power efficient at the same time. Not just the processor but inclusion of 4GB LPDDR3 RAM has made this device run without a hitch even while heavy multitasking and gaming. Even in the prolonged use of camera and gaming, the phone doesn’t heat much but occasional warmth can be felt near the camera module. Even after the continuous playing of graphics intensive games like Nova and Asphalt Airborne, no stutters or drop in frame rates were ever noticed. Coming to the storage, it has 32GB non-expandable storage which might happen to be deficient in a long run.  Camera   As the name suggests, the Coolpad Cool1 Dual has a dual camera lens of 13Megapixel each on its back accompanied by dual tone LED flash. One is an RGB sensor and the other is a b/w sensor. These two lenses work together to give better quality photos and aid in faster focusing as well. I tried testing when exactly this dual camera comes into play. The photos taken with single RGB lens and using both lenses didn’t have much of difference outdoors but the differences were seen in photos taken in low-light.      Coolpad Cool1 Dual Photo Samples   1  of 8                                                                                                  The camera app has different modes including an SLR mode that lets you capture portraits with bokeh effect. This artificial blur in the background is done completely by the software and while taking such photos the camera app needs some processing time before it gets ready for the next capture. Other regular photos come out decent. But under low light conditions, there are noticeable grains and even the flash doesn’t come much handy as it overexposes the subject most of the time. Coming to the videos, the rear camera is capable of shooting up to 4k videos and shoots 120fps 720p videos in the SloMo mode. But the videos that were taken handheld come out a little shaky since it has neither optical nor electronic stabilization.   On the front, it has 8 Megapixel 80-degree wide angle lens that takes decent selfies under good lighting condition. But selfies taken on artificial lights seem to have lots of grains in them. The front is capable of shooting 1080p videos at the highest. It’ll be safe to say that it is definitely not the best selfie camera phone you can buy in this price range.  Software and UI      Coolpad Cool UI ScreenShots   1  of 6                                                                              This mobile boots on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with EUI 5.8 layered on top. So, it has the doze mode and supports Google Now on tap. If you haven’t used a LeEco phone before the UI might look a little strange to you. This is a heavily skinned and customized UI that takes a time to get familiar with. But once, you get to know what’s where things start to get simpler and easier. I liked how the UI has been made flexible for the one-handed operation like you can swipe down from any part of the screen to drag down the notifications. The so-called “control center” that can be accessed from the recent apps also aids in one-handed operation as the quick toggles are easily reachable as opposed to those placed on top in stock android.  But that was my experience and whether you’re going to like it or not is completely subjective.  Battery  This phone has a humongous 4060mAh battery that will easily last for a full day or beyond even in heavy usage. It is the first phone out of those I reviewed lately in which battery was never an issue. I used to charge the phone at night and starting using the phone right after I wake up. After using the phone the whole day, I used to have enough juice left on my phone that let me use the phone until late night. \xa0I could easily get the screen on time of 6-7 hours without bothering to lower brightness or disabling the haptic feedback while typing. The phone comes with different battery management feature if you want to prolong the already good enough battery life.  Also Read  TOP SMARTPHONES WITH THE BEST BATTERY LIFE  It even supports fast charging and the 10W charging brick comes with the phone itself. Though it supports Quick charge 2.0, the charging time was nothing as 50% in 30 minutes. However, the phone charged noticeably faster than other regular phones. This phone has a USB Type-C port so your old phone’s data cable won’t be of any use to it.  Connectivity and Sensors   In network connectivity, it supports dual Nano SIMs and both can be of 4G network. I used both 4G SIMs on the sim tray and the mobile data connectivity was pretty stable from both the numbers. The earpiece was loud enough even while taking phone calls in the crowd. The device comes with active noise cancellation as well. The Coolpad has check listed every essential sensor in the design of the phone. To list them out, it has WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1, A-GPS, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass and IR sensors. The rear-mounted fingerprint is not the fastest but pretty quick and accurate most of the time. Plus, this fingerprint sensor can be considered to be multifunctional one as it can be used as a shutter button while taking photos. Plus, I found it really handy to unlock my social media apps.  Also Read  BEST 4G LTE SMARTPHONES IN NEPAL FOR EVERY PRICE SEGMENT  Verdict on Coolpad Cool1 Dual      Coolpad Cool1 dual   1  of 2                                      This dual Nano SIM phone that comes with all the essential sensors we look forward to having on a phone is pretty impressive. The best part is its powerful processing, promising cameras, awesome battery life and more than enough RAM. This phone would have been the best buy if it had a 64GB storage on board or a microSD card slot or a hybrid SIM tray. The non-expandable storage is the only considerable con of this phone. So, if you believe you can live with limited 32GB storage on your phone, then it certainly can be your next daily driver.']",[]

['Understanding the nanometer technology: Why should you care?'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['March 16, 2017']",2017-03-16 16:24:55+00:00,"['Qualcomm released its flagship chipset  Snapdragon 835  and Samsung is going to bring new flagship phone Galaxy S8 with  Exynos 8895  (also with  Snapdragon 835  variant) chipset on it. Both the processors mentioned are designed in 10nm technology. MediaTek is also working with TSMC to bring out a chipset with 7nm fabrication. These are the smartphone processors. The computer chipset maker Intel and AMD are focusing on even smaller nanometer technology than the fore-mentioned sizes. We are often befuddled with the terms explained regarding the processors and the nanometer technology in is one of them to bother us. So without any further ado, let’s focus on it.  What is nanometer technology?  Before jumping straight to the nanometer technology, first of all, it is necessary to know that any chip, IC, processor, memory or GPU is made from the integration of a large number of transistors. Since such chips are made with the integration of a large number of transistors inside it, we call them ICs (Integrated circuits) in general. And according to the number of the transistors integrated to make such chipsets, they are classified as SSI (small scale integration), LSI (Large Scale Integration) or VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration). In the ICs, there are blocks or modules of the transistors with subtle connections between them.  A transistor essentially consists of Drain, Source, and Gate. There is a path to flow electrons (and hence current) between the Source and Drain, which is called channel. Gate is responsible for controlling the width of the channel. Broader the channel, slow will be the speed of electrons flowing in the channel and vice versa. The nanometer technology mentioned in a processor is the measure of average distance between the channels.        Smaller the better. But how?  Smaller the nanometer distance between the channels faster will be the communication between the two transistors. This is a general perception. However, there are additional advantages of it and some of them are discussed below.   Each transistor used on the chipset will have a smaller size. So larger number of transistors can be packed inside the chipset having the same dimension as that of chipset fabricated with larger nanometer distance.  Facility to fabricate a large number of transistors in a small chipset offers more features to be packed into it.  Smaller transistors are faster, which lets them work at higher clock rates. This improves performance.  It also results in the reduction of Gate Oxide thickness, which in turn reduces the transistor capacitance and hence the voltage/current required to charge capacitance. So the overall power consumption decreases. As a result, the efficiency increases.   Possible drawbacks  Keeping the advantages aside, there are also some downsides of smaller nanometer technology. Some of them are discussed below.   Heat dissipation : – With the smaller size, the heat produced from the transistors will have a smaller area to dissipate and hence to cool. This may cause overheating of the chipset inviting accidents.  Quantum Tunneling : – With the smaller size, the size will be comparable to the atomic size. Because of the smaller gaps, some electrons may take a leap from one place to another for no reasons. This phenomenon is known as Quantum Tunneling. This may cause corruption of data and malfunctioning of chipsets.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nanometer-technology.png']

['Eye – an iPhone case that is an Android phone itself'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 16, 2017']",2017-03-16 07:19:19+00:00,"['With the improvements in the phones themselves, even the phone cases are coming with the upgrades. The phone case was originally meant to protect the phones from damages in case of accidental drops. And, then the cases started being a fashion statement giving users the freedom to customize how their phones look and feel. Recently, phone cases started being an additional power source for the phones. Even the Apple itself made such battery cases for the iPhones and it got the warm welcome as well.\xa0When it comes to choosing between Apple and Android, it is so hard and many of us end up buying two phones. But Now, you don’t need to. Just buy a case for your iPhone that is not just a case but an android phone itself. Yes, I’m talking about the “ Eye “.  Eye – The Smart iPhone Case   The\xa0Eye by ESTI is such an amazing idea that started on Kickstarter and is turning into reality much sooner. Keeping up with its thin profile just like any traditional phone case, Eye offers a lot. It is not just a case but the phone itself running on Android 7.1 Nougat. By using this phone case on your iPhone, you can make your already good iPhone even better. Eye currently is being designed for iPhone 6, 6s, 7 and 7plus. The manufacturer claims to make such phone case even for the next iPhone, the iPhone 8, as sooner as within next month from its release.        Highlight offerings from Eye   5inch Full HD AMOLED Display  Pure Android  Wireless Charging  Always On Display  2800mAh Battery  2 Sim Slots (4G)  Up To 256GB of Storage  NFC Enabled  Infrared Sensor  3.5mm Headphone Jack  Selfies using the back camera of iPhone    The Eye is just 90grams heavy and 13.1mm thick. Under the hood, this case (or should I say phone), is powered by Helio P20 OctaCore processor coupled with 3GB LPDDR3 RAM and backed by\xa0Mali-T880 MP2 GPU. It has 16GB of onboard storage expandable up to 256GB via microSD card. It comes with\xa0Gyro, Accelerometer, Proximity sensor, and Ambient light sensor along with Bluetooth 4.2 and IR blaster. For charging, it has lightning port even supports Qi wireless charging. For network connectivity, it has dual hybrid SIM tray. It comes in two different color options of Jet Black and Matt Black. The retail pricing of the product will start from $189 and goes up to $239. However, the backers can get the same product for the price as low as $95. The backers worldwide will get their product shipped in August 2017.  Verdict:  This is truly what I call thinking out of the box. This case is really innovative one and is worth the buy. For those who want to have the best of both the Apple and Android, now no longer need to buy two separate phones. The Apple fanboy now can feel proud to have the added features to their iPhone that will make their already good iPhone\xa0even better. The best part about this case is functionality to use iPhone’s back camera for selfies. I wish if this was available right away but 6 months of wait for accessories like this is totally worth it.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/eye.png']

The buttons are located on the right side and provide\xa0good feedback.\xa0Below the screen on the Gionee A1 is a fingerprint reader/home button.\xa0It’s blazing fast and snappy and unlocks the phone in less than a second.         I have used the  Samsung J7 Prime ,  Huawei GR5 2017 ,  Coolpad Cool1 , and  Oppo F1s  in the past, and comparing side by side with the Gionee A1, the Gionee A1 feels more premium and better looking.   Display:  The Gionee A1 features a 5.5-inch 1080P display with 2.5D curved glass and 401 ppi. It’s an IPS panel so the color is accurate and the viewing experience is excellent. Since I didn’t get the chance to use the phone during sunlight, I couldn’t comment on its sunlight legibility yet, but while using indoor, the brightness seems ample. I will be able to tell you more after I use the phone for few days.   Camera:  The Gionee A1 comes with a\xa013MP Sony Rear camera (IMX 258). It’s the same sensor found on the  Gionee S6s  and  Lava A3 . The rear camera is good, but nothing extraordinary. There’s enough detail, colors are nicely saturated, but the dynamic range is average. Up front, it gets interesting as it features a whopping 16MP selfie camera. It’s the phone biggest asset. Even in the indoor lighting condition, the 16MP camera shows good promise.  \xa0   Performance:  Gionee has also\xa0upgraded the chipset on the A1, going from a 1.3Ghz MediaTek MT6753 on the Gionee S6s to a MediaTek Helio P10. That one still uses an octa-core Cortex-A53 processor, but at a higher clock speed of 1.8Ghz. You also get more RAM – 4GB – and the storage doubled to 64GB ( and yes there’s a microSD card on the side).  This configuration yields in a good performance if you are not a heavy user. Having said that, it’s a missed opportunity for Gionee in this department. The competitors offer more powerful SoCs at this price range. Bottomline, better-performing phones can be found for the same amount of money, or even less, so if ultimate gaming performance for all your money is top on your list perhaps you should be looking elsewhere.  Connectivity and Sensors  The Android 7.0 running Gionee A1 features a dual hybrid SIM slot and both the SIM slot supports 4G (VOLTE). There is also dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2 (but no detail on aptX for high-quality audio), microUSB 2.0, USB OTG, and an FM radio receiver.\xa0It also includes all the sensors like proximity, accelerometer, barometer, and gyro.

Battery:  Speaking of the battery capacity, the Gionee A1 has a big 4010mAh battery. It also comes with fast charging (18 Watts) that the company claims will charge the phone from 0 to 100% in 2 hours. It also features a dual chip charging technology that keeps the battery cool and safe when the phone is being charged.

"['The Indestructible Drone: crashes, reforms and flies again!']",[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 15, 2017']",2017-03-15 06:47:37+00:00,"['The reason that keeps us on hold from buying a drone is they are simply destructible. One crash and puff, it’s gone.\xa0But things are about to change with this new drone that survives any crashes and drops like nothing happened. This insect-inspired drone is so flexible that it easily absorbs shocks when it crashes and automatically reforms itself making it flight ready within another second.  What made this drone “Indestructible”?  The main property lies in its design that is insect-inspired. Just like a wasp’s wing is rigid and flexible at the same time. The researchers from Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) worked on this idea and came with this  research product  that looks so promising.         This drone prototype is made of a central case and a thin fiberglass external frame with four arms held together by four magnetic joints. This soft and flexible fiberglass helps to make the drone withstand crashes without having permanent damages. The circular magnet is placed at the middle making the magnetic connection to all those four magnetic joints. That is how the drone now becomes rigid and ready to fly. At the time of crashing, the drone flexes and deforms as the holding magnet gets out-of-place but doesn’t split\xa0away. To avoid magnet from splitting away a rubber band is attached to the\xa0magnet from all four arms. That way, right after few seconds from the crash, the drone reforms and becomes flight ready as you can see it from the video above.  Verdict:  Well, this research is hinting towards more durable commercial drones in the future. But, is this drone really that indestructible? Honestly, the answer is “Not really”. It is because this drone did survive 50 drops but from the height of 2 meters only. So, it’s not the regular height for flying drones. The real question now is can this drone survive drops from like say 50-100m? Only when it can survive such drops then we could confidently say that it’s an indestructible one. However, it is so good to see that not just the consumers but even the designers and manufacturers are also interested in making durable and crash-resistant drones.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/multicopter.png']

But previously, Google and the manufacturers focused on making the phone as cheap as possible.\xa0But cheap Android One couldn’t get the hit as expected since the manufacturers cut different edges while making the phone cheaper. So, though the software was never an issue, Android One happened to be far from someone’s buying option because of it’s below par offering in the specs.  But things changed after Google and General Mobile started making the Android One phones. Yes, the Android Ones are no longer sub-$100 phones but are surely worth the buy even in the price range of around $300. One of the Android One offerings from  General Mobile  is the GM 5 Plus which is now available for  preorder in Nepal . It is priced at Rs. 25,000 in Nepal. The phone will be on sale from 4th April 2017 and the first one to preorder will be the first one to get the phone.  PreBook Your GM 5Plus Here  General Mobile GM 5Plus: What’s Inside?         The GM 5Plus comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protected 5.5inch Full HD display with 2.5D glass up top. This phone, with metal frame and textured plastic back, is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 Octacore 64-bit Processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of Storage and is expandable up to 128GB.

The updates come as quickly as they’ll be announced. But few things still make this device far from the best buy and that is not necessarily because this device is giving less but because devices in the similar price range are giving more.

Facebook has come under a lot of criticism lately for cloning Snapchat’s features on Instagram, Whatsapp, and Messenger.  And now, another messaging application, Viber has followed this trend too albeit in a different manner. The messaging giants have thrown in some of the old Snapchat features which had made the application popular among the public.  Viber users will now get to set a timer on their entire messages and pictures by creating a new ‘secret chat’ with someone. While we had already got to see the timer feature, secret chat is a new of its kind. Even though other social media applications let you add self-destructing timer for texts, Viber is the first to let users automatically delete an entire text.         Similar to Snapchat, Viber also alerts users when another person takes a screenshot of their conversation. The ‘secret chat’ feature adds up to Viber’s ‘end-to-end encryption’ feature and the ‘hide messages’ feature.  Users can simply add a person to talk to in a secret chat. Along the ‘send’ button sits a timer when lets users set a time limit for the message to self-destruct. The new feature is easy to use and configure.  “Make your conversations more meaningful by choosing what stays and what goes. Secret messages give you the ability to decide when the photos and videos you send will disappear from your conversation and, in doing so, let you decide what should and shouldn’t be a permanent part of your conversation history”,  the application shared on their blog.  “Some things are meant to be seen once and then never again. When you send a secret message, it can be viewed exactly one time and, maybe more importantly, it can’t be shown to anyone else afterward.”  The above mentioned features can be found on Viber’s newest update.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/viber.png']
['Massive Price Drop on Xperia XZ and Xperia XA'],['Sony Xperia'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['March 14, 2017']",2017-03-14 06:44:21+00:00,"['Nepa Hima Tradelink Pvt. Ltd, the authorized distributor of Sony phones in Nepal has announced a massive price drop on two of their leading models, the Xperia XZ Dual and the Xperia XA Dual. The  Xperia XZ  is the most expensive phone from Sony in Nepal right now and it just got way more affordable. The XA Dual, on the other hand, is a midrange phone  launched around half a year back  and for what it offered, we thought the price was ridiculous but with the price drop, it is now justifiable.  Xperia XZ which was earlier priced at Rs.75,000 is now priced at Rs.59,500 and the Xperia XA which was launched at Rs.34,499 is now priced at Rs.19,000.  Sony Xperia XZ:  Sony Xperia XZ   is the latest flagship phone from Sony in Nepal. The phone is aesthetically beautiful with Sony’s industrial design and is one of the most premium android phones you can buy in Nepal today. The phone comes with a 5.2inch Full HD display with pixel density of 424. Sony’s display never fails to astonish the users with its tri-luminous display powered by the x-reality engine which\xa0makes pictures look sharper, reduces noise, improves contrast, and fine tunes saturation.         Xperia XZ is powered by last year’s Snapdragon 820 chipset which has quad core CPU where two energy efficient cores are clocked at 1.6Ghz and rest two powerful cores are clocked at 2.1GHz. That power coupled with 3GB of RAM, this phone flies over anything you throw at it. Considering its new price, the phone is a bit pricier than the OnePlus 3T and the 3T seems to provide better specs like the new SD 821 Chipset, insane 6GB of RAM, dash charging, regular android updates and more. But it doesn’t mean the pricier Xperia XZ is any bad for any of that matter, you get an exceptional build quality, a well-rounded Sony apps environment, and most importantly water resistance. The phone does feature\xa0the latest gen quick charge (3.0) and comes with a modest 2900mAh battery.  With this price drop, it makes this phone, one of the best alternatives to the flagships like the S7, S7 Edge, Huawei P9 and many others.  Sony Xperia XZ Specifications:   IPS LCD 5.2 inches Full-HD Triluminous (1080×1920 pixels) Display  Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow (upgradable to 7.0 Nougat with December’s security patch)  64GB ROM with microSD card (up to 256 GB)  3GB RAM  23 MP, f/2.0, 24mm, Phase Detection and Laser Autofocus Rear Facing Camera  13MP Front Facing Camera  Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 820 Chipset  Quad-core (2×2.15 GHz Kryo & 2×1.6 GHz Kryo)  Adreno 530 GPU  Active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic; 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio  IP68 certified – dust proof and water resistant over 1.5 meter and 30 minutes  USB Type-C 1.0 reversible connector  Fast charging with Quick Charge 3.0  Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery   Sony Xperia XA:  Sony phones are well made and often the midtier devices are also of utmost quality like their flagship phones. The same thing applies here with the Xperia XA, although a midrange phone, it comes with a solid premium build and minimal design. The phone is nothing special when you look at the specs sheet with its 5-inch 720p display, decent Helio P10 Chipset, 2GB RAM, and a minute 2300mAh battery but the phone was launched with a massive price tag of Rs.35,000 which sounded completely ridiculous. Then the price was cut to Rs.22,000 and now it’s up for just Rs.19,000 which seems more reasonable.   But of course, you are not just paying for the specs and what’s under the hood, Sony phones are made premium and the Sony App ecosystem is something you’ll get hooked to and will enjoy using.

['Infocus Epic 1 Full Review: Is it really Epic?'],"['Android', 'infocus', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['March 14, 2017']",2017-03-14 06:42:19+00:00,"['Nepal is starting to become a holy grail for selling higher mid-range smartphones. Every day we get to hear news about the launch of a new device or even the launch of a new smartphone manufacturer.  Infocus, an American brand, too launched its product last year in Nepal via Prism Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Since then, they have been trying to make an impact with sales in the mid-range category. In the process of doing so,\xa0Prism Technologies launched the Infocus Epic 1 in January this year amid much fan fare.  I recently got a chance to use this device for over a week. The smartphone will be available starting March 14 at Rs. 30,000. Today, we take a look at whether the device lives up to its pricing and claims in this full review.        DESIGN  Probably the best feature of the Infocus Epic 1, the design stands out among everything else. I was impressed by the design at the back from the first time I held the device. It features a high-quality brushed-metallic back. At the back, the device is engraved with a primary camera which is accompanied by a dual-tone flash which is really bright. The smooth and glossy back has resulted in the device being extremely slippery, though. But the rounded edges make the Infocus Epic 1 comfortable to hold. I really had to handle the device with care after I nearly dropped it a couple of times. A fingerprint scanner sits below the flash. There are two antenna bands on the back: one at the top and one at the bottom.   The design at the front is a bit weird, though. Overall, it looks bland and odd. Also, the front bottom bezel is one of the worst features of the Epic 1. There is a circular earpiece on the top, which might be a new design to some. A couple of sensors, a LED light, and a secondary camera accompany the earpiece. The bezel on the bottom, like I said, I something I really dislike. It reminded me of the bezel on the Pixel that everyone hates.  On the right side, there are volume rockers and a power button. They are tactile and easy to press but it’s their placement that I have issues with. The volume rockers are placed…..the right side of the device. There is a SIM card + memory card slot on the right side.   There is a headphone jack and an Infrared Sensor on the top. The Infrared sensor is a welcome addition in the device. For those of you who do not know, the Infrared Sensor can transform your device into a remote which can, in turn, let you control your electric devices such as TVs, Amplifiers, Set-up boxes, Projectors, DVDs, etc. I really missed the IR sensor when I went back to my previous device.  DISPLAY  Devices in the mid-range category usually feature full HD displays and the Infocus Epic 1 is no different. It sports a tall 5.5-inch LTPS full HD display with the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Right off the box, the first thing I noticed about the display was the black band that surrounds the display.  [Note 1: Dear smartphone manufacturers, please lose those black bands around the display in your new smartphones. No one likes it and no one wants it. It only makes the smartphones look ugly.]  Other than the annoying black band, the display is quite vibrant and colorful. It is not quite saturated and popping like that of an AMOLED display, but it still is good. I had no problems viewing the screen under direct sunlight. I am a fan of cooler displays and the Infocus Epic 1 didn’t disappoint me. Oh, and for the warmer display lovers, there is a ‘Bluelight filter’ which can remove up to 75% of the blue light emitted by the display.  SOFTWARE  On the software front, the Infocus Epic 1 comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with Infocus’ very own Inlife UI on top. The UI is snappy and lag free. Right off the box, the device doesn’t feature any app drawer. But this can be changed via the preference setting. Even though I am inclined towards stock Android experience, I didn’t mind using the Infocus Epic 1. It does come with a couple of bloatware but I didn’t mind them (excluding BeautyPlus Me which I couldn’t even uninstall).        1  of 6                                                                              There is, however, no option for configuration and addition of gestures and functions which made the software experience quite dull which brings me to my note 2: Dear smartphone manufacturers, please include the configurations and gesture features in your smartphone. It makes the overall software experience top-notch and the smartphone can become livelier. The software was overall quite snappy and responsive, which now brings me to the main point of reviewing any smartphone or device – the performance.  PERFORMANCE  Let’s talk about the specs first. Underneath the hood, the Infocus 1 is powered a MediaTekHelioX20SoC that combines with a whopping Deca-core processor with the clock speed of 2.11GHz. The 10-cored processor is aided by 3GB of RAM and Mali-T880GPU.   Now on to the real life performance, the Epic 1 is a classic example of the statement ‘ more cores doesn’t mean better performance ‘. Well, it’s not that the device lags all the time, but while playing games, it does stutter. Even while playing a simple game like Bat Climb on Messenger, the device started to stutter sometimes which I thought was a bug in the app. But when I played the same game on another smartphone, it didn’t lag at all. But do note that this happens sometimes.  The device still gets me worried when it heats up while playing high-end games or watching videos, like really hot. This heating issue also arose when I was charging the device. This is probably the result of the fast charging feature the Infocus Epic 1 comes with. Other than these, I faced no issues with the device. Except for a few times, even graphic intensive games work like a champ. Also, the IR sensor on it works quite well and is one of the best features, at least for me. If you are a moderate smartphone user, then you won’t be most of the issues I have mentioned, though.   HARDWARE  Talking about the hardware, the Infocus Epic 1 houses a USB Type-C port for charging and connectivity options. This is a welcome addition as its inclusion has made the device future proof. Alongside the port is a single speaker grill. The speaker sounds good and is really loud for a single speaker. It, however, lacks the stereo sound effect that we all love. It also gets covered easily while holding the device while playing games or watching videos.   Storage wise, the Infocus Epic 1 comes with 32GB of onboard storage which can be expanded up to 128GB via a microSD card slot which also serves as the second SIM card slot.  CAMERA  The Infocus Epic 1 is equipped with a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture lens. This lens is accompanied by a dual tone flash which is quite bright and helps in the balance of color while taking pictures. Infocus is cashing in on the optics of this camera. The manufacturers have claimed the device’s optical zoom to really shine. But it didn’t quite live up to my expectations. Yes, the ‘zoomed in’ pictures look better than what few of the devices in its price range can offer, but is it a stand out feature of the Epic 1? Probably not.   But I really liked the pictures that came out of the Infocus Epic 1. They were well saturated, vibrant and colorful. The best part of the rear facing camera was the macro shots that came out. They looked great in a well-lit environment. In a dark environment, the pictures come out quite noisy. They, however, aren’t as over exposed as other devices of this price range.   At the front, the Epic 1 is embedded with an 8-megapixel front-facing camera with f/1.8 aperture and 82° wide angle lens. It takes some decent social media ready selfies. It, however, suffers in low light.   FINGERPRINT  Like every other smartphone these days, the Infocus Epic 1 also comes with a fingerprint sensor. I have already mentioned that the fingerprint is located below the primary camera and flash. The fingerprint security is easy to setup and lets you add up to 5 fingerprints. But I couldn’t get the scanner to work a 100% of the time. I should also inform that there are faster fingerprints in devices which cost way lesser than the Infocus Epic 1.   CONNECTIVITY  The Infocus Epic 1 has dual SIM slots for dual hybrid NANO-SIM card which means that the buyers will have to choose between a secondary SIM and a microSD card. Other people didn’t complain about the call quality and told me it was good.  The device supports 4G connectivity which is a necessity since Nepal Telecom has already started the service in Nepal. Other connectivity options include WiFi b/g/n, GPS, Bluetooth v4.2, hotspot and FM Radio. Sensors in the device include Magnetometer, Accelerometer, Proximity, Ambient light, and Gyroscope for the perfect virtual reality (VR) experience.  BATTERY  The Infocus Epic 1 is equipped with a 3,000 mAh battery. While on paper, a 1080p display and a 3,000 mAh battery might sound like a good match, the reality is the exact opposite. Under heavy usage, I got just around 3 hours – 3 and half hours of screen on time. My usage constituted of internet browsing, calling and gaming. The battery life certainly disappointed me as I had high expectations from it. But hey, there is at least an inclusion of fast battery charge. I got from 1% to 60% in just around 41 minutes. The USB Type-C connector helps in the charging too.   With a device priced at Rs. 30,000, the manufacturers should have included a bigger battery that could get users a screen on time of over 5 hours.  CONCLUSION  With the increasing number of smartphones in each and every category, the manufacturers should now be selling the best devices here in Nepal. Or they might fall behind if they miss out on a single aspect of their smartphones. Infocus is taking a huge gamble with the Epic 1 as the device excels in the looks and camera department, but falls behind due to the stuttering processor and overheating problems.  In short, the Infocus Epic 1 is a device with great aesthetics, good camera and an average performance even with the deca-core processor. To be the best of the lot, the Infocus Epic 1 still needs to perform well, and have a better battery life. Otherwise, there are other devices in a lesser price range which are certainly better than this device.  IF YOU’RE WEREN’T IMPRESSED BY THE INFOCUS EPIC 1, HERE ARE SOME OTHER OPTIONS YOU CAN CONSIDER:  Huawei GR5 2017  Priced at Rs. 29,999 , the Huawei GR5 2017 packs in an impressive dual camera at the back. The device utilizes the dual lenses for a great bokeh effect. It houses a Octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 655 chipset and a 3,340 mAh battery.  Coolpad Cool1  Launched in January, the Coolpad Cool1 is equipped with two 13-megapixel rear-facing camera on the back. Underneath the hood, the device is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 SoC and a whopping 4,060 mAh battery.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3  Available at Rs. 27,999, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 features an impressive 4,050 mAh battery and a 16-megapixel primary camera. It is powered by a Quad-core Snapdragon 650 chipset.  Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime  Another great device in Epic 1’s price range, the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime comes with a 5.5-inch 1080p display and a 64-bit Exynos 7870 Octa-core processor. It is currently available at Rs. 28,490.']",[]

If you want a phone with a fingerprint scanner, you can have a look at  Colors P85 . It looks reminiscent of iPhone 6 and also sports a front fingerprint scanner that works really well. Other specs include a 5-inch HD display, 1GB of RAM, 16GB ROM, and 5MP selfie camera.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/samsung-J2-price-drop-nepal.jpg']
['Samsung Electronics acquires Harman in $8 billion deal'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 13, 2017']",2017-03-13 11:17:36+00:00,"['Samsung Electronics now acquires Harman International Industries after penning the deal worth $8 Billion. This is the biggest acquisition from the Korean Giant that was known for either buying small startups or doing its own innovations.  More About Acquisition:  This acquisition didn’t come as a surprise as it was already foreseen from the November’s press meet between the authorities of both the companies. But now it is now official and the Harman is now an independent subsidiary of the Korean Giant. This is really big of an acquisition since Samsung is only known for either owning small startups or doing its own innovations. Samsung is now the 100% owner of the Harman. For those who don’t know Harman,\xa0HARMAN is made up of 30,000 employees working on the Harman Kardon,  JBL , Lexicon, Mark Levinson and Infinity brands dedicating itself in mobile, home, automotive and industrial audio.         This acquisition will not be having much of changes in the original organizational structure of the Harman. And yes, Dinesh Paliwal still retains his CEO position at the company. Speaking on this acquisition he said,\xa0“Samsung provides Harman with the scale, platform and complementary technologies to accelerate growth and extend our global market leadership in automotive, smart audio and connected technologies….Samsung and Harman will define – and drive – the future of automotive.”  What to expect from this acquisition:  This acquisition hints towards something new that we can expect from the Samsung. Samsung is likely to have some stumpings in the ground of automotive industry. The driverless car is the new cool in the industry and now we can count Harman with its new owner to come up with some innovative offerings of such kind. As of today, we don’t have much to share about the future autonomous car from Samsung and Harmon but it will surely sport some badass audio system. Plus the car’s user interface will be made up of Samsung screens and semiconductors for sure. This acquisition will also be felt in the Samsung electronics, most likely the mobile devices. If not the S8, the Harman powered audio system is likely to be introduced in future Samsung devices, most likely the Galaxy Note 8.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/samsung-1.png']

Obviously, the pricing will be a little higher than the current 3GB/32GB variant. Hence, the phone is likely to be priced competitively at around the price range of Rs. 33,000 to Rs. 35,000 in Nepal.  Huawei GR5 2017 (4GB/64GB)   This new variant of  Huawei GR5 2017  looks just as same as the already available one on the outside but the real difference lies on the inside of the phone.

For me, they have proved to be a nuisance, the reason I don’t like using a wallet. But all this changed after I got to use DAX.  What is DAX you ask? It is a simple and compact wallet that has a nifty ‘trick up its sleeve’. The wallet has a snap which, when pulled out, gives a way for a number of tabs.         Crowdfunded through Kickstarter and Design nest, the project got funded over 200% in just a single day. Design Nest is a crowd funding program of Allocacoc. Thus, the company is the official distributor of the product.  Sammy Traders, the official distributor of Allocacoc in Nepal, brought the DAX wallet in Nepal at CAN Infotech 2017. The price is now available at Rs. 950.  Design wise, the DAX is a different-than-normal wallet. It is really small and sits comfortably in the hand and in the pocket. Outside, there is a strap which, as I already mentioned, opens the inner side of the product. The strap sticks to the wallet due to a magnet. DAX’s logo sits on the front. A small compartment is on the back which is useful for adding an extra bit of card or money.   Pull up the snap and you will be greeted by a number of tabs. There are five slots where cards can be stored. I did use it for keeping my money though I always have to fold it in a particular way which is time-consuming.  Why is the DAX priced at Rs. 950? Well, the manufacturers have claimed that the product is made up of ‘fabric originally fabricated for industrial use’. The wallet does feel premium but the threads at the sides have already worn out a little, and it has not been a week since I started using it. I should also mention that the tabs are really wobbly and made of plastic.  The thin and light material (or fabric) that makes up the DAX is water repellent. But do note that it will get drenched if you get it completely wet.   Should you buy the DAX?  Well, if you are a person from the business-class who uses a couple of ATM cards to pay for stuff, or if you to store tons of visiting cards, then DAX is the wallet you need. But if you just store use wallet to store money, which is probably what most of us do, then I can’t really think of a reason for buying it. I will be using it because of its light, thin and compact body, though.  The DAX is available in three color options: Monochrome, Amber and Midnight Blue.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dax-2.jpg']

And why wouldn’t they? The performance and functionality of laptops come second to none. That’s why manufacturers are producing powerful and never before seen laptops.  Just like laptops, the accessories too are getting high-tech and out of control. Even stands are developing day by day. But they come at a high price, which is why most of us opt and settle for nothing.         But this could change with an innovation that kick started from Kickstarter. Levit8 is a foldable and portable stand for your laptop which lets you make a desk anywhere without a need of assembling anything. It has been made available in Nepal through Sammy Traders, the official distributor of Allocacoc products in Nepal and the price is now available starting from Rs. 2,290 for the smallest of the lot and Rs. 2,890 for the largest one.  The Levit8 has a simple design with a twist up its sleeve – literally. When not used, it looks like a simple file. It is easy to carry around and can fit in a backpack. My review unit stood 13.8-inches tall when not used and 10.2-inch when folded. There are eight creases on the fabric which is useful in folding and twisting of the product.  The stand follows an age-old origami folding technique and boy have the manufacturers implemented it nicely. However, it took me quite a while to set it up. But once I did, I cursed myself for being an imbecile.                   Considering its size, I was skeptical at the Levit8 at first but got the hang of it soon enough. While I use it as a laptop stand when sitting down, it can be used in other ways too:  • Working on the laptop while standing up.  • When using a laptop while sitting on the floor.  • Watching videos when doing chores.  Not only this, the stand can be used for other purposes such as using it as a book or clothes holder or as a folder.  The fabric that makes up the Levit8 is water-repellent and stain proof. It is light but can carry up to 20 times its weight. Ergonomic to say the least!  Well, though the fabric is of a good quality, the thread on the edges have started to wear. The Levit8 is a truly portable and useful stand meant for different purposes. I thought the pricing of the product was expensive but after my time of using it, I have changed my mind. The Levit8 is a simple foldable desk that is useful any time of the day. And while it might not float in the air like its name suggests, it does perform the lifting up work in great measure.']",[]

Apex Digital Smart Stores are one of their kind and offer real friendly environment inside for reviewing different brands under the same roof.         Mr. Prakash Subedi, Brand Manager of Apex Digital said, “The Smart Store at Fulbari Market, Itahari – a place you need to visit where customers can have hands-on experience with  touch, feel and compare  various brands of  mobile handsets and accessories  under one roof.”  Apex Digital is displaying smartphones from  Apple ,  Samsung ,  Nokia ,\xa0 Gionee ,  HTC ,  ZTE ,  Xiaomi ,  Lenovo  and  ZOPO  along with other branded mobile accessories.

At any apex digital smart store, anyone can do such compare. Just go to the desk pick up the phone you’re planning to buy. Right when you pick up a phone, its specs are displayed on the display that is placed just above the desk. But say, if you’re not sure about which phone to buy then compare them just by picking both the phones and then the same display will be showing the specs comparison between those phones.

['Zopo Flash X Plus Review: Stepping it up'],"['Reviews', 'Zopo']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['March 10, 2017']",2017-03-10 06:39:09+00:00,"['The  Zopo Flash X Plus  is a recently launched budget phone. In Nepal, it comes with the price of Rs. 22,500 and for that price, it comes with few worth mentioning features like the full metal body and fingerprint sensor. So is the Zopo Flash X value for money and is it worth being your daily driver? Let’s find out in this review.  Build  Zopo Flash X Plus on the first glance looks like the OnePlus Three minus its logo. The all metal phone is built well,\xa0fancies premium fondness and feels sturdy in the hand. The black version with stealth finish is utterly pleasing to the eyes but on the downside, it is susceptible to micro scratches and smudges.             The Zopo Flash X Plus will be available in 4 Color Options too.    1  of 2                                      It has a fingerprint sensor mounted on the front which also act as a home button and on its sides lie the minimally backlit capacitive recent and back button. The\xa0fingerprint sensor is pretty quick in action and takes less than a second to unlock the phone. On the right, there’s the volume rockers and power button. The power button has a textured finish for identifying it while the volume buttons are just plain. I had problems with the lock buttons on my review unit as they took more than 3 clicks to either lock or unlock the display. There is micro USB port and speakers on the bottom.   Display  The phone has a 5.5-inch Full HD display which comes with a 2.5D glass. The screen has pretty good color reproduction and is well saturated as per my liking. Watching movies and playing games is an immense pleasure with this display. The phone has pretty thin side bezels and the black color cloaks the extra bits that remain. Outdoor visibility and the viewing angles are both excellent on this phone. You’ll have a great experience with videos but despite having dedicated sound enhancement options the audio has pretty low volume and sounds tinny; same goes with the earphones.   Performance  Talking about performance, this phone flies over your day to day usage with normal apps and multitasking, but if you are a power user, I think it is fairly underpowered with the octa-core Mediatek MT6753 processor which is clocked at 1.3Ghz. The phone is fluid while navigating around the UI, Opening apps and all that stuffs.  But I had few hiccups when there was a lot of apps on the memory and gaming for a longer period of time.   Multitasking was solid with 3GB of RAM as you could load plenty of apps and switch between them without app restart most of the time. On the gaming front, it can handle high-end games like Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger 2 and Modern Combat at low/medium settings with occasional frame drops. Having said that, there are better gaming performing phones at this price range like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 that is equipped with superior Snapdragon 650 processor.\xa0  Camera  The 13MP Rear Camera is tagged as the main highlight of the phone and uses the Sony IMX 135 sensor. The camera’s UI is pretty old from those KitKat days and doesn’t offer any distinct modes and features but on the bright side, it has zero shutter lag which makes taking photo enjoyable.   Testing the Camera for few days, I had mixed results with its output. During daylight, images come out fine with natural colors and justifiable dynamic range but at often times the highlights get blown out and the images lack sharpness when you zoom in. Nonetheless, these photos are ideal for your social media uploads. The camera really wowed me while taking photos at night, as images were clear and had very few grains in them. The video quality was also decent but lacked sharpness.  Up front, the 8MP camera is equipped with wide angle lens. I was intrigued with the quality and details it provided. Even photos taken at artificial lighting came out nice but with low light, grains will cover up your picture.\xa0 You can find image samples here!   Software  Using the UI of this phone will take you back to the Kitkat days again although the phone is running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The UI looks pretty dated by default, but luckily you have a theme store where you can get a bunch of modern themes for your phone or you can always opt for a third-party launcher. The phone also comes with few tricks up its sleeves like the smart wake options where you have pretty much all the off-screen gestures from the OnePlus Devices, including drawing C to open the camera, O for phone dialer and so on. You can also toggle music while the screen is off by drawing upward and a downward arrow. And on top of that, there’s gesture sensing and audio equalizer.        1  of 3                                                Battery  The phone comes with a 3100 mAh battery which gave me the screen on time of around 4 hours on a regular usage which is average and nothing shy of extraordinary. It also takes 2 hours to completely charge the phone even with its 1.5Amp charger.   Verdict  This phone has one of the best aesthetics for the price and feels really premium. You also get a sharp full HD display and a fast fingerprint sensor. The major drawback of the phone is its camera which gave mixed results overall. In the same lighting condition, sometimes it gave the best picture I could think of and often times it just failed to pick up the details there. Also,\xa0it’s not an ideal choice for high-end gamers as the MT6735 SoC is not as powerful as the competition.\xa0      Pros  Cons    Metal Body  Android 6.0 Marshmallow; Will Probably Not receive Nougat 7.0    Excellent Full HD Display  Inaccurate Camera    Fast Fingerprint Sensor  MT6753 is a dated Processor']",[]

Ltd. , the national distributor of Oppo Smartphones in Nepal, has launched Oppo F1s with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. This new Oppo F1s is priced at Rs. 31,999. However, the older variant of Oppo F1s with 3GB RAM and 64GB is said to have been discontinued hereafter.  [Update: the Oppo F1s 4GB version is available now for Rs.28,990]  Oppo F1s (4GB/64GB): What’s inside?  As the phone comes with the tagline “Selfie Expert” it does house a front camera that looks even more promising than the rear one, at least on paper. The selfie unit is of 16MP whereas the rear shooter is of 13MP only. That was for the camera, but a phone is not all about just\xa0cameras. The phone offers a little more than its competitors but it cuts on few edges as well. The first is its 5.5-inch display that offers a resolution of 720*1280 pixels. That is certainly lesser that what it’s competitors are offering on their phones of similar price range. However, the display is protected with a Gorilla Glass 4 and that’s something sweet. Under the hood, the device is powered by MediaTek\xa0MT6750 OctaCore processor clocked at 1.5GHz and backed by\xa0Mali-T860MP2 GPU. Lighting up this device is a\xa03075 mAh battery.         KEY FEATURES OF THE OPPO F1S  • 5.5-inch HD display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels (267 ppi) • Android 5.1 Lollipop with ColorOS 3.0 • 34GB ROM with expandable storage (up to 256GB) • 4GB RAM • 13 MP, f/2.2 aperture with Phase Detection Autofocus Rear Facing Camera • 16 MP Front Facing Camera • Mediatek MT6750 Chipset • Octa-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 processor • Mali-T860MP2 GPU • Fingerprint sensor • Non-removable 3075mAH battery  Verdict:  The introduction of this variant of Oppo F1s can be considered to be something positive. Since it offers more of RAM and memory for the same pricing as its older variant. But, is its offering competitive enough? If you ask me, the phone is still far from being a competition to phones of similar price range. The phone does come with praiseworthy selfie module but the manufacturer has cut few edges. The first being the 720P display and second, the phone is based on outdated Android 5.1 Lollipop. The update was rumored to be on its way but the update availability is still uncertain. So, if it’s just the selfies you’ll use your phone for then only this phone can be considered to be a wiser buying decision or else, you might wanna look somewhere else and you will definitely find a phone giving more for the same price.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/oppo-F1s-Nepal.png']

OnePlus 2: Is it\xa0too old to buy?  Well, yes the phone already has two successors to it but it still can be considered to be a good buy. It is all because of what it has on the inside. The OnePlus2 is powered by SnapDragon 810 processor coupled with 4GB LPDDR4 RAM and backed by Adreno 430 GPU. This 5.5inch phone offers a resolution of 1920*1080 pixels. Coming to the cameras, it has a 13 MP, f/2.0 unit with laser autofocus and dual-LED flash. For the selfies, it has a 5MP unit which might sound a little short.

['JBL Headphones E45BT and E55BT Launched in Nepal'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['March 9, 2017']",2017-03-09 09:22:57+00:00,"['Evolution Trading Pvt. Ltd., the authorized distributor of JBL products in Nepal, has launched E45BT and E55BT in the market of Nepal recently. These two wireless headphones are the latest ones in the E-series of JBL headphones. JBL E45BT and E55BT are now available for purchase from any Evo-Store Outlets at the price of Rs. 12,500 and Rs. 15,800 respectively.  JBL E45BT: Wireless On-Ear Headphone   JBL E45BT is one great of an offering from JBL in the E-series of JBL Headphones. It was first released in October\xa02016 and its availability in Nepal within 5 months from international release still can be considered soon enough.\xa0It is an On-Ear (Supra-aural) model so don’t expect it to hide your ear completely inside its leathered cushions. However, it rests pretty well on the ear and there’s enough of room for your ear to hear the sound coming from the surrounding as well. There are different perks of On-Ear headphone over Over-Ear headphone and the one I like the most is, the portability it offers being in a smaller dimension and yet without compromising the immersive sound experience. The usual controls like volume toggles, play/pause button, Bluetooth switch and power controls are placed around the right pad’s outer ring.         Here are few key highlights regarding the features of JBL E45BT:   Powerful 40 mm speakers  Textile headband  Up to 16 hours operation time  Frequency range: 20-20000 Hz  Impedance: 32 Ohm  Controls and microphone on the outer ear  Colour: Black  Includes charging (micro USB) and 3.5 mm aux audio cable (for wired use)   JBL E55BT:\xa0Wireless Over-Ear Headphones   JBL E55BT is an over-ear headphone\xa0offering from JBL in the E-series of JBL Headphones. It’s availability in Nepal now is pretty appreciable since it was first launched in October 2016. It is a little bulky one as it’s an over-ear one that can hide your whole ear inside of its leathered\xa0cushion. That way, you can enjoy your music by ignoring the sounds coming from the surroundings. Like E45BT, it also comes with aux cable that can be used with devices without Bluetooth connectivity. The control button Button placements are just like that in E45BT. The adjustable headband is well-padded\xa0and is covered with some fabrics. This headphone is claimed to provide 20hours playback time and once you go out of charge, you can charge it via microUSB port that sits on bottom part of the left pad.

But headphones aren’t the easy ones to choose from so many available options in the market. Even in the market of Nepal, a wide variety of Bluetooth headphones can be found both the cheap ones and the premium ones.   So, while on a tight budget buying the cheap non-genuine ones can be considered to be an understandable decision. But, in a long run and for a quality music experience, nothing can beat the premium ones that might sound a little costly at first but in a long run are totally worth it.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/JBL-Headphones-E45BT-E55BT.jpg']

You are chilling on a Saturday afternoon, basking under the Sun when all of a sudden you hear a buzzing sound. A quadcopter soars over the ground near your house and drops something. A few minutes later: BOOM! It didn’t take you long to figure out the ‘thing’ the drone dropped was a bomb. Luckily there are no accidents or casualties.  Why am I blabbering all this you ask? That’s because ISIS has upgraded the technological aspect of their war. The situation I asked you to imagine recently happened in Iraq. Over a month ago, in January, the Islamic State fighters showcased their strengthening arsenal and tech weapons.  A reporter with the Agence France-Presse (AFP) took to Twitter to report an incident that occurred on Mosul, a city of Iraq. According to the reporter, a drone that was embedded with a bomb was taken down by the Iraqi Army later on.        Source: Sara Hussein  The drone was reportedly weaponized with a 40mm grenade which is typically used in grenade launchers. And when the drone’s design and logo was taken into account, there was no mistake that the device was a  DJI  drone. The model that ISIS used was the Matrice 100, a quadcopter made for developers.  DJI Matrice 100  The Matrice 100 is a programmable drone that can be used for business purpose, research purpose or just for having fun. Currently, the quadcopter is available to purchase at $3,299 in the international market. While it isn’t a military grade device, the Matrice 100 can still carry a weight of around 1.2kg.  ISIS has recently increased the use of quadcopters in their war. The group had released a video showing off young terrorists using different types of drones as a bombing machine through smartphones and tablets. The drones in the video are however different and probably even cheaper than the Matrice 100. And they have even shown the drones bombing different places. A video that sent chills down my spine.  The use of such an expensive piece of tech shows how ISIS is taking a serious step into a tech and air force battle with governments of different countries.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/isis-using-drone.png']

This laptop costs about Rs 1,84,990 and still, we can justify its price with the help of the following six points.  VR ready  This is one of the first laptops you can buy in Nepal with a GTX 1060 graphics card which is Virtual reality capable. This is something even the more expensive last-generation GTX 980M cannot do very well. All you need are the necessary gears to run it and the GTX 1060 will cut through VR games like a cake.         Sufficient processing power  The sixth gen Quad Core i7-6700HQ processor inside may not be the latest offering from Intel. But still, it has enough horsepower for even the most intense processing work. And this will also not limit your gaming experience by any means.  1080p ready at 60 fps  The GTX 1060 is seriously powerful. It can run almost all the games at 1080p at 60fps on high settings. This is thanks to the new pascal architecture from NVidia which is a huge upgrade over the previous generations.   Awesome display  Talking from experience, IPS is one of the biggest upgrade over TN panel in terms of screen quality. And this laptop features an IPS screen. \xa0It looks so much better than any TN panel and has a very wide viewing angle. People might complain about why it’s not a 4K screen but keeping in mind the GTX 1060 doesn’t exactly support 4K gaming it would have been pretty useless. And turning down the resolution for the games to work smoothly would not be as crisp as it could.  Runs cool and doesn’t throttle under load  This laptop is 2.4Kg and almost 29mm thick. This might hamper portability but buyers will be happy to know that those compromises were made so that the laptop runs cool even under load and also doesn’t throttle even under heavy load. There are also two fans to keep the CPU and GPU cool.   An SSD  SSD aren’t very popular in Nepal as we focus mostly on quantity over quality. But this laptop has 256GB of SSD storage and 1TB of HDD storage. So, in general, you get the best of both worlds. Having an SSD help run the laptop feel a lot snappier.   There are also other things you can consider when buying a laptop. For one the keyboard is very good and you can even program the backlit keys. The speaker, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are also some of the best in class. There is also a USB type C port, which Apple claims are the future. And there are sufficient ports so that you don’t need any dongles ever. MSI also has its own bundle of software\xa0pre-installed to improve your gaming experience.

Smart Tattoo: What we know so far  The technology as described on  MIT’s website \xa0is called the DuoSkin. According to the researchers, this temporary smart tattoo can be made by designing the circuit using any graphic software. Then the tattoo is stamped on a gold leaf (which is widely available and conducts electricity). And hence, other commodity materials and components need to make tattoo interactive are then applied.  The smart tattoo so made can be used in three different ways:        Input Device:   DuoSkin can be designed to be used as an on-skin interface for controlling your phone or similar electronic devices. Such design can be used as a trackpad for the mobile devices.  Output Device:   Another design option of using DuoSkin is to use it as a color changing display for your tech-based tattoo that changes color as per your body temperature.  Communication Device:   This smart tattoo can be also be used to exchange data wirelessly.\xa0For wireless exchange of data, NFC tags have to be attached alongside the data. This technology can be used to unlock NFC-based door locks by placing your smart tattoo near the lock.  Verdict:  It is from such research, tech industry gets to see something new and amazing. So as a research and its result, this DuoSkin is something impressive. That said, we can’t assure its commercialization. It is still far away from being an applicable commercial product. But once its potentials are explored, this innovation might turn out to be a revolution in the wearable industry. Lastly, DuoSkin has already found a way of going commercial as a Digital Skin Jewelry which is a color changing one.

Plus, another sweetness is the Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. I hope these rumored specs won’t turn out to be true. If the memory offerings will of 3GB/32GB then only Samsung will be able to stand competitively with the Chinese Manufacturers that offer heavy specs at a lesser price.

Since then we have come a long way and have been seeing significant changes on these assistants. But the one to break the norm and move ahead of the general Q&A assistant to AI-powered\xa0more immersive tool is the almighty Google Assistant.   Google Assistant  which was till now only available for Pixel Devices, Android Wear 2.0, Allo App and Google Home is finally coming to the phones of general users who are running Android Marshmallow or Higher on their device. The update is slowly rolling out and has been available for USA, Canada, Australia and UK and soon will hit different regions. You will automatically get notified about the Google Assistant with an upgrade to your Google Play Services.        Google Now Vs. Google Assistant  Till now, many of us are confused about the Google Now, Google Now on Tap and the Google Assistant and why wouldn’t you be? Google Assistant is just an upgraded version of the Google Now. They perform most of the things almost the same and is activated with the same ‘Ok Google’ voice command. But to differentiate, Google Now just answers your immediate questions and shows you a Google Search result for that, while with Google Assistant the experience is more engaging/humanly and gives results with more details and personalized suggestions.   Google Assistant does so by remembering your past queries and facts like your birthdays, favorite foods and so on and comes up with personalized results based on that. You can have more humanly conversation and play games with the Google Assistant unlike in Siri and Cortana.  Google wants to power as many devices as it can with the Google Assistant. Google Assistant is getting more intelligent than ever with its deep learning algorithm and now can be integrated with a lot of third-party applications. Google is also trying to provide the experience in most of the countries in their native language. Google Assistant even supports Hindi now, so we can hope for the Nepali integration anytime soon in the future.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Google-Assistant-Nepal.png']

That is when I started believing,\xa0Oppo to be the smartphone brand that thinks out of the box while designing camera. This MWC, Oppo proved me right again with their new prototype model of smartphone that featured 5X optical zoom capability. If you like 2X Optical zoom in iPhone 7plus then you’re gonna love this.  How Oppo managed to get 5X Optical Zoom on a smartphone??  The shortest answer will be, Oppo managed to get 5X Optical Zoom with a dual camera module.\xa0But this dual camera setup is pretty different than what we’re familiar with. That is why Oppo has registered 50+ patents just for this dual camera module. This set of lenses were engineered just like a periscope to achieve 5X Optical Zoom.         According to Oppo, this dual camera setup uses a unique periscope-style structure to divert light through a prism and into a telephoto lens nested inside the smartphone, set at a 90° angle to a rear-facing wide-angle lens. As opposed to the traditional placement of telephoto lens and wide angle lens side-by-side, this innovative placement has made it possible to get 5X optical zoom from a module that is only 5.7mm thick.  When it comes to zooming, the stability is always a huge issue. And, Oppo seems to have kept it in mind while designing this module. Therefore, this module comes with newer Optical Image Stabilization. Here, both the telephoto lens and the prism are capable of producing mobility to encounter the shaky hand movements.  What will the results be like?  The theories don’t give as much of overview as the samples would do. So, from the Oppo’s official site, we’ve gathered few samples that are showing side by side comparison of iPhone 7plus 2X zoom and Oppo 5X zoom.      iPhone 7plus 2X Vs. Oppo 5X   1  of 3                                                Oppo has uploaded a video of zoom test on it’s official YouTube channel. In this test video, iPhone 7plus with 2X and Oppo 5X zoom prototype are placed side-by-side and photos were taken. The stability in Oppo’s new dual camera module is also explained with respective samples. Here’s that video from Oppo:   Verdict:  It’ll be safe to say this technology can be noted as a milestone for achieving optical zoom in smartphones. Digital Zoom in a smartphone camera is all about cropping and enhancements. What is real and worthy is the Optical Zoom and with the release of iPhone 7plus, just a 2X zoom looked ridiculously amazing. But now, Oppo seemed to have proved itself to be a winner with a 5X optical zoom in a phone.\xa0We can expect Oppo to release a commercial product with such capability by the end of this year.

It refers to\xa0the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. Basically speaking, it is the protection of data or information available in the cyberspace from being manipulated or destroyed. It has been a matter of threat and concern for many organizations and associations to handle the issue of cyber security consciously. Those companies need to hire experts to address potential problems. This is a relatively new job field with a labor shortage. It is bound to provide new opportunities and perspective to women.  Understanding this situation, the WiCyS (Women in Cyber Security) initiative was launched in 2013 with support from a National Science Foundation grant for a collaborative project between Tennessee Tech, University of Memphis and Jackson State Community College. Since then, with support from various industry, government and academic partners, WiCyS has become a continuing effort to recruit, retain and advance women in cyber security. The main goal of WiCyS has always been to bring together women in cyber security from academia, research, and industry. This team has been working to bring women together for sharing of knowledge/experience, networking and mentoring.         However, despite all these efforts, according to the Women’s Society of Cyberjutsu, only 11% of the world’s information security workforces are women. To change this scenario, efforts have been put forward globally. Training, education, and empowerment of high school girls, college grads, professionals in other fields, and IT workers interested in crossing over to cyber, has been rigorously encouraged and practiced.\xa0They are also geared towards education and opportunities for internships and jobs for women in cyber security. The NYU Tandon School of Engineering offers the GenCyber Computer Science for Cyber Security Summer program for High School Women which offers\xa0three-week, a full-day summer program to provide an introduction for high school women to the fundamentals of cybersecurity,\xa0and computer science.  Similarly, the SANS CyberTalent Immersion Academy for Women offers women a fast track to top jobs in cyber security.\xa0The Women’s Society of Cyberjutsu focuses on providing training, resources, and programming to enhance their cyber learning experience.  Thus, it is pretty clear that, with these numerous opportunities for education and employment lined up for them, now is the perfect time for women to join this dynamic field of cyber security.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/women-in-cyber-security.png']

So instead of trying to improve the battery backup time, it will be a better to improve the battery charging time. And that is what Meizu did at the MWC this time with their new  Super mCharge  technology.   MCharge has come a long way and the one they are previewing at the MWC is already the fourth generation of that technology. mCharge uses a high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system. The charger used for the mCharge is rated at 11V/5A for 55W. If you are curious if it’s fast enough, the fastest charger from OnePlus (Dash Charge) delivers 5V/4A for 20W. The maximum temperature of the battery will be 39C and you should be able to comfortably use the phone while plugged in a\xa0wall.

The highly praised fast proprietary charging technology of OnePlus called the Dash Charge is still there giving its users a day’s power for half an hour. It has the same rear camera unit of 16 MegaPixel that still rocks the Optical Image Stabilization and sports the same fingerprint scanner. Nothing has changed in the audio sides as well and for those concerned, yes, it still has a 3.5 mm headphone jack.  Why it’s called the OnePlus 3T, but not OnePlus 3S?  As the OnePlus said, it wanted to give its user a better experience and said this new phone is a hardware update to its last offering along with the software update. As far as the naming goes, it had something interesting to say,\xa0“We went with ‘T’ because a lot of other companies go with ‘S,’ and since we are OnePlus we decided to go with the next letter, read one more.” Well, that sounds logical to some extent but I wish if T was an acronym for something like Turbo or Tweaked.

But looks is not what the Xperia XZ Premium is made for, the 19MP camera equipped with the phone named Motion Eye is capable of recording  Slo-Mo video at 960 frames per second  at 720 resolution which is insane! Not only that, the camera also comes with its own memory which starts capturing photos in the background as soon as it detects motion and when the shutter button is pressed it pulls the image which it had already taken, resulting in zero shutter lag. The camera is\xa0also said to have a great low-light performance\xa0 and anti-distortion features. Also, the phone comes with a dedicated shutter button.  Xperia XZ Premium   comes with a 5.5inch screen with the world’s first  4K HDR display  resulting in insane 801ppi. With the HDR display, colors will be brighter, sharper and punchier. And it has partnered with Amazon for the 4K HDR contents which the users can enjoy on their phone. But like the  Xperia Z5 Premium , the display is quiet, not 4K. It shifts the resolution to 4K only when you are viewing 4K contents and other times it will switch back to Full HD. The phone will be powered by the latest Snapdragon 835 Chipset and comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage, also offers micro sd card slot for expansion. The phone also keeps the headphone jack alive and comes with a\xa0USB C port. It sports a\xa0side mounted fingerprint sensor which acts as both power/lock button. XZ Premium is also IP68 water resistant.  Xperia XZ Premium runs on the latest version of android 7.1 Nougat\xa0and is backed up by 3,230 mAh battery which seems relatively small for all the power that it’s packing.\xa0 It will come in three colors, Chrome, Ice Blue and Black. \xa0Despite an early preview, the phone won’t be launched until spring and the price is expected to be over $800.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cover-e1488189699278.jpg']

Right from the Day 0, we started getting along with the phone launch events. The first launch was of the\xa0 Blackberry Keyone . Then pre-launches\xa0were followed by that of  the LG G6 ,  Huawei P10/P10 Plus , and\xa0 Nokia 3/5/6 . But what is more exciting about this year’s MWC is the ZTE Gigabit Phone. This is the world’s first phone that comes with 5G compatibility and supports download speeds of up to 1Gbps.  ZTE Gigabit Phone: How did it achieve 1Gbps download speeds   The main reason behind this new phone with insane mobile data speed is the network modem used in its chipset. The phone houses the Qualcomm’s newest chipset and that’s the Snapdragon 835. This chipset features\xa0an integrated Snapdragon X16 LTE modem. The phone managed to get up to 1Gbps speed due to the 4*4 Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna technology\xa0and 256-Quadrature Amplitude (QAM) Modulation.        The phone is on display in Barcelona, Spain. However, this phone won’t go for sale to the consumers. So, it’s like a concept phone that managed to be more than just a concept phone.  Moreover, the ZTE Gigabit Phone can be taken as a hint to the future. It’s showing us 5G is getting nearer. But can this be called a “pure 5G” phone? Well, for now, let’s just say it is a 5G capable phone. It is in the sense that 5G standard is yet to be finalized. And major network carriers worldwide are about to test the 5G in the year 2017/2018. Hence, the 5G can be expected to go global by 2020.  Coming back to the 1Gbps download speed the phone supports, it is ten times faster than first generation 4G that’s still in use today. It’ll come handy while live streaming 360-VR videos, instant cloud access and downloading HQ audios and videos in time lesser than a second. Hence, this phone is a great achievement in mobile data connectivity.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/zte.jpg']

Marking some of the rumors as true and others as codswallop, the flagship device from LG, LG G6 launched at MWC 2017 in Barcelona, Spain. LG has claimed that this device is for the ones, who are in pursuit of perfection. LG G6, the newbie ditched the modular design carried by its predecessor  LG G5 . However, it came up with aesthetic metal and glass body, non-removable battery, astounding camera and a very new aspect ratio. It will not be an exaggeration to mention that the manufacturers have primarily focused on device display while making the new LG G6.  Credits: LG USA Mobile  The device seems undoubtingly astounding in the solid Aluminium frame with Gorilla Glass on the front and the back. It also bears USB-C port (fully waterproof), a single speaker and mic on the bottom. The device also has rounded corners with a larger display in a hand-adjustable size. The fingerprint scanner of the phablet resides on the black just beneath the dual-camera setup.  Display of a smartphone is what really matters in a smartphone because the screen is the focus point of a smartphone. Everything we do is centered on the screen. So, we all want is a larger screen, which displays the things we need to see fitting perfectly on the screen. This is not impossible; however, it comes with a downside. Along with a larger screen, the device bears greater dimensions making us difficult to carry on our pockets and to hold and use with one hand. To evade this problem, the nascent LG G6 comes with a larger display of 5.7 inches that fits perfectly in our hand. This has been possible since the top and bottom bezels are shrunk in the LG G6.        Credits: LG USA Mobile  The new descendent of LG family comes with Quad-HD resolution with Full Vision display. The pixel density of 564 PPI is great but the aspect ratio in this smartphone seems quirky. However, the LG team has explanations for it. According to them, this new aspect ratio is close to the direct eye vision. They explained that this aspect ratio would be pleasing to the eye than long and narrow aspect ratio of 21:9. On the question of difficulty for the users on this new kind of display, the speakers mentioned that Amazon and Google Play have been working with this kind of display. In addition, they also assured that the users could expect no difficulty with this display because of its compatibility. The makers also boasted LG G6 as the first smartphone to have Dolby vision / HDR 10.  Credits: LG USA Mobile  The phablet is powered is Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, which is a Quad-core (2×2.35 GHz Kryo & 2×1.6 GHz Kryo) CPU. LG G6 works on Android Nougat (v7.0) version flavored by LG UX UI 6.0 on the top. On the optics side, LG G6 sports dual-camera setup on the back each of 13MP. The setup will be capable of shooting wide-angle photos and videos. The front is also capable of shooting wide-angle photos and videos and has a Megapixel count of 5MP.  Credits: LG USA Mobile  The battery on the device is 3300 mAh non-removable battery, which is an upgrade to its predecessor. In order to shorten the company with wall charger, the device also inherits Quick charge 3.0. For the safety and reliability of the device, Ian Hwang, the Product Planning Director of LG electronics mentioned that device is tested with penetration test, shocks and force tests.

We have been seeing many concepts and prototypes on the internet. But, very few seemed near to perfection and reality. Out of all those, the E-hang seemed impressive right from its introduction. We’ve been seeing E-hang being showcased in three CES in a row right from 2015. E-hang, fully autonomous flying vehicle that can transport one passenger has been getting a lot of attention since its first introduction in 2014. \xa0But, Hoversurf, the Russian startup, is now becoming the next name to be taken when taking about the hoverbike. The company has recently released the trailer of its coming commercial hoverbike on YouTube. It is the first of its kind that lets a man fly it just like one rides a motorbike.  Scorpion 3:\xa0You can fly it but should you?   The Scorpion 3, the World’s first manned hoverbike, boasts the frame design of a dirtbike. Instead of wheels, it has four propellers just like any other flying drones. The best part is, the man flying this aircraft will have full manual control. The rider (or should I say the pilot) can surf in the mid-air, take turns and accelerate up to the speed of around 50km/hr. Moreover, the craft is designed to fly as high as 10 meters.        This air-borne electric powered craft runs on in-house software that has different safety programming embedded in it. This single seated quadcopter can carry a weight of up to 120kg. Flying the Scorpion 3 looks thrilling but is it safe? That’s the real question to be answered.      Scorpion 3 from the Hoversurf   1  of 4                                                          At the end of the day, I think it’ll be safe to say it is a drone that can fly a man with it. Well, drones, we’ve seen many releases and many came with the issues. Take, for example, the Karma drone from GoPro which was recalled after 16days of its release. The drone started falling out of the sky for no known reason. What will happen when the Scorpion 3 will have such issues? The damages such issues are gonna create are unthinkable. We’re talking about lives here. Plus, those sharp metal propellers rotating at such speed could easily chop off your legs. So, for those excited to ride on Scorpio 3 when it becomes commercially available, all I wanna say is just think twice.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hover.jpg']

Named UHS-II SDXC, the SD card comes with a read and write speeds of whopping 300 and 299 megabytes per second respectively.  If you have used digital cameras, you definitely know about the messy problems that arise due to the limited write speed of SD cards, be it during capturing still burst pictures or when shooting 4K videos. So, in order to overcome this problem, Sony came up with the UHS-II SDXC.  Talking about the product, Viviano Cantu, Vice President, Product Marketing, Sony Americas Media and Energy Group, said,  “As the continuous shooting of higher-resolution images and adoption of 4K video with DSLR and mirrorless cameras increases, the inherent need for larger, faster and more dependable cards becomes apparent.\xa0 A longtime leader at the forefront of professional media, Sony has met these growing demands with the debut of the SF-G Series, which offers industry leading performance.”        But how is the performance in the SD card boosted? Sony has used a new algorithm in it that can ‘prevents loss of speed in data writing even after repeating burst shooting’ which in turn helps in speeding up a camera’s ‘burst shooting’.  The company is yet to disclose the pricing of the UHS-II SDXC but we can expect it to be a tad bit expensive during the time of its launch. It will come in three variants – 32GB, 64GB and 128GB.  Sony, however, isn’t the only manufacturer to come up with this high-speed memory cards. SanDisk previously launched its Extreme Pro SD UHS-II cards that feature a read speed of 300 MB/s and write speed of 260 MB/s. So, even if the UHS-II SDXC is extremely fast, it won’t be long until we see a release of a SD card with much greater speed.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sony-sdcard-GBN.jpg']

['5 Easy Tricks to Boost Your Router’s WiFi Strength'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['February 23, 2017']",2017-02-23 11:36:44+00:00,"['Approximately, 10years ago Internet at home was considered a luxury. But now, it can be considered as an essential. Well, who doesn’t have the internet at home? But things get messy sometimes. We all have experienced the WiFi strength at home not being uniform throughout. So to boost the WiFi strength at your home, should you replace the current router of yours? Well, not necessarily. That said, yes new routers come with new antennas and new technology embedded in them. But still, with few easy tricks, you can boost the WiFi strength of your current router at home. Here we’ve listed 5 easy tricks to boost your WiFi strength.  1. Right placement of the router   The first easy trick is finding the right spot for your router. Right placement of the router is something we fail to take advantage of. But which spot is the right spot for the router? We have to find an answer for this question first. Well, it depends on the house design. Just the easy way is to find the spot that has the best line-of-sight to each room in the house. But make sure, it is not inside a cabinet or closet you’re keeping your router. Plus, it’s always better to keep router away from metals and walls. They are what absorb your signal the most, resulting in degraded signals. While placing the router, don’t place it low like over the floor. It is always better to place your router at some height. It is because some antennas are radiating signal in little downward directions.        2. Keep it away from the Interference   The routers basically operate in 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Here, in Nepal, most of the routers being used operate in 2.4GHz frequency. It is the same frequency\xa0band being used by the household appliances like microwaves, cordless phones, and others. So, in order to minimize interference from those appliances to your router, place your router away from such appliances. The best would be to keep your router in isolation from any other electronic devices such as TVs and others.  3. Changing the channel of the network   Interference to your WiFi network might come from the routers nearby. That could be your neighbors’ routers. So, to prevent your signal from degrading from such interferences. Try changing the channel of your router. Check the signal improvements with the change in the channel and set it to the channel that gives the best signal strength inside your house.  4. Antenna Positioning   The signal strength reception is also related to the antenna positioning. The alignment of antennas in phone depend on how you hold your phone. But most of the time when we’re using our phone it is placed slightly vertical. So positioning antenna of your router vertical can be found wiser for using the internet on phone. But in laptops, the antennas lie horizontally. So, to increase WiFi connectivity with your laptops the antennas are better positioned horizontally. Antennas get connected the best when their alignment is parallel. The best routers are the one with two antennas, that way you can place one vertically and the other horizontally.  5. DIY signal booster for your existing antenna   If your signal is a little weak at the edge of your house then with some easy DIY tricks, you can extend the range of your WiFi signal. The best easy trick is the one in which you can make the use of your empty beer/soda can that might be lying in your trash bag. Follow  few simple steps  to cut the can as demonstrated in the tutorial and put it around the antenna. And bam! Now the range of your signal will be extended without having you to buy a new antenna or a repeater.  Verdict  Are these the only tricks one can do to boost his/her router’s WiFi strength? Well, the answer is no. I mentioned only the easy ones that anyone can do. If you are wondering what are the other tricks. There are tricks like hacking your router and installing some firmware that will allow you to change the power output from the antenna. Put perform such tricks at your own risk. Because that way, you might end up frying your router. Plus, if you are not on a budget, you can buy a repeater to extend the range of your home network’s WiFi signal. Additionally, if you have a spare DSL router lying around, you may use it as a repeater itself.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/router.jpg']

When you ask people what superpower they’d like to have, there are many who’d say “Flying”. Up until today, no human has really taken flight. But scientists and engineers in Netherlands have been able to make a car that moves magically inland and on air.  Netherland-based PAL-V company has launched – \xa0Liberty Sport and Liberty Pioneer vehicles: the flying cars.\xa0These three-wheeler vehicles are the very first, commercial flying vehicles.  Robert Dingermanse, CEO of PAL-V, has said that their team has been able to create the innovating flying car which also encompasses the existing safety standards determined by regulatory bodies around the world, after years of hard work, beating the technical and qualification challenges.\xa0The company claims to have collaborated with a “leading” Italian design agency to give shape to this machine. The first concept of this project was tried out eight years ago.         The PAL-V Liberty has been described as an epitome of safety and fun. It is an outstanding release trademarking the age of flying cars. The design and architecture of the car are not much different than those that we see every day. It has been modeled keeping in mind the everyday traffic. It has been built around a unique Rotax engine that powers a dual-propulsion drivetrain. Its rotors are unpowered. When the vehicle is in drive mode, its propeller conveniently tucks into the back of the vehicle and the rotors fold-up top. According to the company, the Liberty can travel at speeds up to 100 miles per hour, and the car can switch from driving to flying mode in just 10 to 15 minutes.  The car can not take off vertically, and the recommended airstrip length has been quoted as 280m. PAL has recommended the use of smooth surface for taking off; nothing fancy, just plain surface, for safety purpose.  Thus, the PAL-V Liberty is an absolute joy for the rider, or say – “pilot”, promising to deliver an unequaled freedom of mobility.  Considering the electronic mechanism used inside, the standard Liberty Sports edition will come with electromechanical dials and limited carbon fiber detailing. And the limited edition Liberty Pioneer will include fancier exteriors, a large electronic flight instrument display panel, and power heating to ensure that you remain comfortable in the vehicle. However, this is a limited edition product and only 90 of them will ever be made.   PAL-V has guaranteed the setup of picturesque learning centers for the flying licence.The company has said to be in contact\xa0with multiple countries asking for permission grants. And in case that it does not receive clearance of operations in any country, the entirety of the money paid for pre booking will be returned to the prospective buyer.  It probably shouldn’t be a surprise that these beasts will cost you a fortune.

The phone launch is now just lesser than a week away, but LG keeps teasing its feature one after another. Recently, the LG released two different teaser clips on their YouTube channel. These two clips hint on two features that the next LG’s flagship will be bringing along. Now, we can confidently say that the LG G6 will be the first water and\xa0resistant phone from LG.  LG G6: Pool (Teaser Breakdown)   The first teaser video LG uploaded yesterday was titled “LG G6: Pool”. There is nothing detailed on an 11second teaser video other than the pool itself and a girl swimming from one corner to another. The end of the video is what mattered that showed the slow animation of LG G6 schematic over the pool. Now, one of the rumors of LG G6 just turned into reality and LG G6 will be the first water resistant phone from the LG. But to find out, which IP certification it will be having we just have to hold our horses for few more days.        LG G6: Flour (Teaser Breakdown)   The second teaser video LG uploaded yesterday was titled “LG G6: Flour”. Well, it was kind of obvious. Every water resistant phone comes with the dust resistance and so does the LG G6. This video was even shorter and was only seven seconds long. The video has nothing but floor poured on a table and at the very end, the slow animation of the phone hinted at the LG G6 to be dust resistant as well.  Verdict  Are these the only teasers from LG? Well, the answer is No. LG has been releasing such teasers like from a\xa0month ago. We have covered breaking down such teaser video to reveal its rumors. If you haven’t read it before, you may read it here:  LG G6: Teaser Video Breakdown\xa0  Now we know the LG G6 will be the first water and dust resistant phone from LG. But the IP certification rating is still in shadow. So, will it be IP65 or IP67 or IP68 certified? To get an answer, mark the date of Feb 26, 2017. It is the day the phone will be launched at Barcelona, Spain.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lg-g6-rumors.png']
['Meitu T8 : World’s First Dual-Pixel Selfie Phone'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['February 22, 2017']",2017-02-22 09:47:45+00:00,"['Meitu, the Chinese manufacturer, is known more for its camera apps and less for its phones. But things are getting changed with its newest release, the Meitu\xa0T8. The T8 is the world’s first dual-pixel selfie phone that houses a 12MP shooter on the front. The dual-pixel technology is a real deal breaker. Many different DSLRS and mirrorless cameras are using this technology. We saw few phones using such technology in the back but it’s the first time it’s being used on the front. To name a phone using dual-pixel technology in\xa0its camera unit on the back, it’s the Samsung galaxy S7. So, if you’re a selfie manic then this phone is what you should buy next. Oh wait, I’ve one bad news and it is the phone is on sale only in China as of today.  More on Meitu T8 (Specs, Price, and Availability)   \xa0        Meitu T8 is the first phone in T-line up of smartphones from the Meitu. This phone is all about the front camera which has a lot to offer. That said, the 21MP unit in the back is no lesser as well. The front 12MP camera, with Sony IMX368 sensor, works on dual-pixel technology for faster and better phase detection auto-focus. Plus, both the units in the back and on the front use fill light technology\xa0and optical image stabilization giving much better camera performance.  The Meitu T8, the selfie phone, uses AI for the enhancement of the selfies. The AI helps in the recognition of age and gender of the people in the selfie. And, Hence will apply the required mode of beautification. Say, if it’s a selfie of a young girl then it won’t apply skin smoothing as it would apply to a selfie of a 50 years old woman. Plus, in group selfies, obviously, there will be a lot of faces. The Camera app used in Meitu\xa0T8 will observe all those faces individually and apply the unique mode of beautification to each of them.      Meitu T8   1  of 4                                                          What about the other aspects of the phone? Well, starting with the design. It is quite different than what we have been seeing lately. The hexagonal design looks different yet lovable.  Meitu T8 Highlights:   2.3 GHz Helio X20 deca-core processor  5.2 inch Full HD display (LCD/OLED yet to be confirmed)  4GB RAM, 128 GB onboard storage (Not expandable)  12MP, f1.8, OIS, dual pixel front shooter; 21MP, f2.2, OIS rear shooter  3850mAh battery, fast charging  USB Type C  front mounted fingerprint sensor  RMB 3,299/USD 480 (Standard Edition), RMB 3,599/USD524 (Angelababy Special Edition)  Colors: Rose Gold, Magic Orange, Bright Blue, Phantom Black   Verdict:  If you love taking selfies on the go and don’t want to bother editing them before posting them on social medias then you should definitely buy the Meitu T8. But unfortunately, phones like the T8 never make into the markets like that of Nepal. However, Meitu T8 is just a beginning. We can expect to see such improvements in the selfie cameras of many other phones in days to come.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/me.jpg']

['This drone can pollinate flowers like a bee'],['AI'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 21, 2017']",2017-02-21 04:45:14+00:00,"['Most of us probably already know that the bee population is diminishing at an alarming rate. And all of us should be really worried about this matter as bees are not only useful in producing honey but are also responsible for pollination, which in turn helps flowers in reproduction. The usage of harmful pesticides, the changing climate, and habitat clearance has resulted in a decrease in the population of bees. And right now, the USA has listed bumblebee as an endangered species.  Apart from some small programs, nothing really has been achieved in protecting the bees. It won’t be really surprising if the bee population gets extinct sometime soon.  Scientists have been working on trying to find a replacement for pollinating plants for some time now. And it looks like they have finally found a breakthrough in the form of drones that can perform pollination. [Black Mirror much?]        Eijiro Miyako and his colleagues at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan, have used the principle of pollination in drones they bought for a $100. They then glued patches of horse hair on the quadcopter to add more surface area so that pollen grain can remain in place. The researchers then applied liquid gel to make the hair sticky and wet.  Their experiment was a success and the drone can now fly around pollinating lily flowers just like a bee would.  But can we get to see automated bee-like robots pollinating flowers like in the series Black Mirror? Well, the scientist? Well, yes. The scientists have mentioned that ‘robotic pollinators could be trained to learn pollination paths by using global positioning systems and artificial intelligence’.  Katja Hogendoorn, postdoctoral research associate, University of Adelaide, said, “It is an intriguing idea, of course, it’s not new as an idea, it’s a start — they’ve achieved it with a very big flower, mind you.”  Well, if this concept can really replace bee population, then it would be something great. But what about the cost price of running this program all over the world? Well whatever it is, I hope they will be successful in using these drones as bees’ replacements because the world will be in a dire need of pollinating agents once the bee population vanishes.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bee-drone.jpg']

Latest Price: Rs. 15,790 [Last updated on: December 6, 2018]         Galaxy On7 Pro at a glance:   5.5-inch 720p TFT LCD Display  Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 (4x Cortex-A53 with Adreno 306)  2GB RAM, 16GB storage with microSD\xa0(Up to 128GB)  13 megapixel rear, 5-megapixel front camera  Dual SIM, 4G LTE support  Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow  3000mAh removable battery  Ultra Data Saving, Sbike Mode The 13 and 5 MP cameras on the Samsung Galaxy On7 Pro produce decent photography experience.   As far as build quality is concerned, it has a plastic body and reminded me of the Samsung Galaxy grand that was launched back in 2013. It feels cheap compared to what the competitors are offering at budget segment these days. The sides also house a plastic frame which makes it less durable.  Moving to the display, it’s a TFT 720p screen which is the area where Samsung has compromised. The TFT panel is way inferior to the AMOLED display that we liked about Samsung midrange phones. The panel has awful color reproduction and viewing angles.  The Samsung Galaxy On7 Pro weighs 171gms and measures 151.8 x 77.5 x 8.2mm in dimension.  Connectivity options include WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and dual SIM with 4G LTE Cat 4. Powering the On 7 Pro is a dated Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 SoC (1.2Ghz Quadcore Cortex A53) coupled with 2GB of RAM. \xa0If you are someone who judges a phone with benchmarks, it scores about 28000 in AnTuTu 6 which is commendable for a phone of this price range.  The 13MP primary camera has an F2.1 aperture lens and LED flash, while the 5MP front camera boasts F2.2 aperture lens, 103-degree wide angle lens, palm selfie and beauty shot. The 3000mAh user replaceable battery is rated to provide 2 days of battery life. However, like with the other midrange phones from Samsung, the On 7 pro lacks important sensors such as auto brightness\xa0and gyro. As expected, the fingerprint scanner is also missing.  So, what are your initial thoughts regarding the upcoming smartphone from Samsung? Let us know in the poll section down below.

['Snapchat Working on a Concept Phone with 360 Degree Camera'],[],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['February 19, 2017']",2017-02-19 16:35:23+00:00,"['Snapchat  is one of the fastest-growing camera app (‘previously social-media’) in the world. At first, the whole idea of Snapchat sounded like a stupid thing, who would want to post pictures that only lasted for 24hours? who would want to send photos using time limits and for the love of god who would want to talk by snapping pictures? But that’s what we’re doing right now, aren’t we? and it has become so popular that other social media giants like Instagram are copying the similar concepts. Well, the company is doing more than just creating a camera app, they are also creating hardware that makes their experience more engaging.  It’s recent that Snapchat has entered the hardware front. A few months back they introduced the  Snapchat Spectacles   which was stylish and most importantly shot videos form your POV and uploaded directly to Snapchat. Although we couldn’t get the first-hand experience of the spectacles but it\xa0seemed really awesome and people seem to totally love it. Continuing the integration of hardware for snapping, Snapchat has recently hired a group of 50 hardware engineers whose goal is to make the perfect smartphone for the Snapchat users.  Image:Mediakix  Well, the specs are kind of raw as it is a concept phone. It will come with a 360-degree camera, a separate front facing camera, a button to easily scroll through filters, one touch capture and sharing. The main goal of the phone is to let users snap and share everything\xa0while carrying the phone on a single hand. The phone will be camera focused so we can expect some major camera integration and to our disappointment, the phone will be running on android. If you have been using Snapchat on android, you already know how disappointing the image quality is going to be despite having a good camera. Although till they launch the smartphone (‘if they launch the smartphone’) we can hope for some optimization for the image quality.        Image: Mediakix  The whole move towards the hardware front is because Snapchat\xa0had to do something different to make the users stick as their\xa0core functionalities are being implemented on other platforms. We don’t know how practical it is to buy a smartphone just to use Snapchat but a lot of things seem stupid at first until they don’t.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapchat-phone.jpg']

Joining the leagues with already available Black onyx, Gold Platinum and Silver Titanium variants of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Coral Blue version has now emerged in the market. The newbie has also brought a luring offer. Now, on the purchase of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge ( costing Rs. 88,900 ), you will also get cash back of Rs. 12,000.  Overview on Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge  Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a year old model in the smartphone arena, though, it’s appealing specs has still made it a strong contender in the race of best smartphones. The curvy screen of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is the most enticing feature any smartphone could bear. That 5.5-inch curved edges screen in the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is of Super AMOLED genre with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection and supports a QHD resolution.         The device also comes with Android Marshmallow version out of the box flavored by TouchWiz UI on the top. The device also bears the privilege for an upgrade to the Nougat version. Powering off the device is done by an Exynos 8890 chipset, which is an Octa-core processor. And the graphics portion is taken care by Mali-T880 MP12 GPU. Storage wise, the device houses a 4 GB LPDDR4 RAM and a ROM of 32 GB with a provision for an enhancement up to 200 GB.  On the optics side, the back and the front side of the device bears 12MP and 5MP shooters respectively. Both the cameras include an aperture of f/1.7. However, the senior one is privileged by the Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). This assembly has made Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge one of the  best camera smartphones . \xa0Fitting perfectly in the size of 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm, the device comes with 3600 mah non-removable battery. In order to shorten the company with the wall charger, the device also inherits a Quick charging technology (QC 2.0).

The device also includes an assembly of sensors like Fingerprint (front-mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, heart rate, and SpO2. In addition, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge holds an IP68 certification for its water and dust resistant body.  Verdict on Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge  Though being a year old, the device costs a hefty price of Rs. 76,900. The device bears alluring specs and obviously worth the price. However, the approaching MWC 2017 will bring new and awesomely built devices and there are a number of devices going to be launched in Nepal very soon, which will obviously prove this device obsolete and might engulf you in the regrets. So, instead of jumping straight to buy Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, I found it witful to wait.

['Using your phone in the bathroom? It could be getting contaminated with dangerous bacteria!'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 18, 2017']",2017-02-18 04:09:01+00:00,"['One question. How many of you are reading this on your phone while you are sitting down on your toilet? Well, if you are, I suggest you to keep your phone away. Why? It is because your device is getting contaminated with harmful bacteria that are in your toilet right now. Sounds scary, doesn’t it? Well, you should be scared. These bacteria can harbor along the creases and edges of your mobile phone. And later, it can easily infect you.  A recent study conducted by Sony has found that around 75 percent of Americans used their mobile phones in their bathroom while as do 41 percent of Australians. And with the level of obsession we Nepali people have with our phones, I am sure that figure is substantial here too.  So, while it might look like you are saving your precious time multitasking, you are actually putting your health at risk.        Dr. Anchita Karmakar, general practitioner, explains, “There are water and air particles that harbor in the little creases of the phone. And phone covers and cases are usually made out of rubber, which is a warm and comfortable harboring ground for bacteria.”  That clears you of the misconception that the cover of your phone is keeping away the germs. The germs include harmful bacteria such as  Escherichia coli , salmonella, and shigella among others.  As Dr Karmakar further adds, “There’s a lot of water involved in the toileting process in Asia, so you wouldn’t want to take a phone in the bathroom for that reason”.  Therefore, it is better if you keep your phone away from toilets, and you should definitely keep it away from the public ones. Imagine tons of bacteria occupying your phone when you enter a public toilet at Ratnapark!  ‘Even if you’re not using your phone on the toilet, you’re still holding it while you’re going in and out of the bathroom, and that’s enough to put bacteria on the phone when you haven’t yet washed your hands,’ Dr Karmakar says.  Also, since a lot of people use their phones while eating, be it for Instagram or just some website, the bacteria easily enter their digestive tract via their mouth. So next time you get sick, it could be because of this factor!  So what can you do to eradicate this risk? It is easy. Just stop using your phone in your bathroom and while eating. Oh and just so you know, one study claims that your smartphone consists of more harmful bacteria than your toilet seat.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/using-smartphone-in-toilet.jpg']
"['Xiaomi Redmi 4A Review: Best Phone Under Rs. 15,000?']","['Reviews', 'Smartphone Review', 'Xiaomi']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['February 17, 2017']",2017-02-17 17:07:27+00:00,"['When it comes to buying a phone, if you can’t afford a flagship, budget phones are the ones you should be buying. There are many different perks of buying a budget phone. First is their affordable pricing. The second is buying another budget phone happens to be cheaper than repairing broken screen of many flagship phones. Plus, when you’re upgrading to the next phone, your investment on the last phone doesn’t feel like a loss. Hence, buying a budget device is always a good deal. But while buying a budget device a lot has to be considered. This is the price segment in which you’ll be getting countless options. We explored through those options and Xiaomi Redmi 4A looked like the best buy on paper. But can it be the best buy in real life use? Let’s find out from this review.  Build  Xiaomi Redmi 4A is a plastic build phone which can safely be said to be a “metal phone wannabe” with its metal-like color and textures. Despite being made out of plastic, the phone is pretty premium to look at and hold. On the bright side, the Redmi 4A is definitely one of the light phones that I’ve held.         The power and volume buttons that can be found on the right edge are well placed and give a nice tactile feedback. I think it’ll be a safe bet to say it is one of the well-built budget devices that you can currently find in the market.        1  of 5                                                                    Display  Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes with a 5-inch IPS LCD display with the resolution of 720 * 1280 pixels. The display has a good color reproduction and decent viewing angles. The display color temperature is tunable. Personally, I think putting the white balance on the cooler side made this display look much better than with regular white balance.   There’s an option for turning the reading mode on that filters the blue color coming from the display and hence soothes the eyes in late night usage. The only downsides are its average brightness and those noticeable bezels around it. But Considering its price, we can simply pass on that.   Performance  Under the hood, the phone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 which is a 64-bit quad-core CPU and is clocked at 1.4 GHz. This CPU is coupled with 2GB of RAM and is backed by Adreno 308. If you find its inbuilt memory offering of 16 GB to be not enough, then you may expand it up to 256 GB.   While using this device running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MIUI 8, I didn’t notice any lags scrolling through the home screen. The loading time of most used apps like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and others were fast enough. However, while switching between the apps that were opened a while ago, a little of a delay was noticed while reloading them. As long as you don’t opt for any graphics-intensive games, you can have a decent gaming experience in this phone.  Camera  The primary shooter of 13 megapixels is satisfyingly good. The macro shots come out decent but sometimes the focus isn’t that sharp. The color reproduction is near perfect and the swiping on screen for exposure management is one of the features that I found really handy. The shooting speed is also faster than much devices in this price range.   But the 5-megapixelcamera unit on the front is just okay and is nothing to write home about. Coming to the videos, its primary shooter is capable of shooting 1080p videos at 30fps. Color reproduction on videos usually happens to be out of scale and the auto-exposure works much slower than expected. Hence, the videography from this phone can be considered as a let-down. Check out all the sample photos  here in this link .  Battery  This budget friendly device from Xiaomi houses a 3120mAh battery inside. It is huge enough to light up a 5 inch HD screen for quite some time. During the time of my review period, I got mixed results from 3 to 5 hours of screen on time depending on heavy and normal usage. But charging the device from 0 to 100% is going to take 2.5hours of your time at the fastest with its regular charger.  Connectivity and sensors  This dual SIM phone packs in every essential sensor we look forward to having in a phone. To list them out, it has WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, A-GPS along with Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, and compass sensors. I put this device in the test with the 4G network introduced by NTC and the experience was pretty decent. The sound production from the earpiece was good enough with no distortions and there wasn’t any call drop throughout my usage. Plus person on the other side could tell that the phone has active noise cancellation built in.   Coming to its additional offerings, it has an IR blaster and plays FM radio without asking you to plug in the earphone. That is a most welcome feature in a smartphone.  Verdict  This light phone with a pretty loud speaker at the back that offers great one hand usability is certainly the best buy for those who prefer better displays over bigger ones. Yes, you can get a few 5.5-inch screen phones with a fingerprint sensor for the same price but when put on real life test, I’m pretty sure this phone will easily surpass them all. That said, I’ve some disappointments with this phone as well, the biggest one being its battery life not being astoundingly good as I expected it to be. And the second disappointment is its average brightness which made me use my phone the least in direct sunlight. Plus, I believe it won’t be out of place to mention, it has a very weak vibration. And Yes, I happened to miss a few calls every now and then.  Hence I’d like to end this video saying this phone is definitely not perfect, but for the price, it’s pretty close.']",[]
['Now is the worst time to buy a smartphone'],"['Android', 'Opinion']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['February 17, 2017']",2017-02-17 10:37:09+00:00,"['When it’s time for buying a new phone, even I find it really hard to decide when is the right time. But, what is easier to decide is when it’s the worst time to buy one. Apparently, if you’re planning to buy your next phone very soon then just don’t. Now is the worst time to buy a smartphone. This is because better phones than what are currently available are just around the corner. So don’t buy a phone that you’ll regret buying just after few months. And, if you are not sure when\xa0to buy your next phone then you’ve come to the right place.  Now, let’s take a look at some\xa0phones that you should rather skip from buying.  Should you buy the discounted OnePlus 3?         The answer is a solid “No”. Yes, you may agree to disagree. But, let me get few points straight. The upgraded version of OnePlus 3, the OnePlus 3T will be officially available in Nepal from the end of this February. Yes, it’ll be a little costlier than its predecessor but it’s worth the price. The upgraded processor, 13% more battery capacity, 16MP selfie camera instead of 8MP and scratch resistant sapphire glass for primary camera lens are the worth mentioning upgrades you can find in  OnePlus 3T .  Is it wise or stupid to buy iPhone 7?   Yes, iPhone 7 and 7plus certainly did bring something new to the table if we do the specs-to-specs comparison with its predecessors. However, it is not that wise to buy iPhone 7 now even though it is the first iPhone with water resistance and stereo speakers. That is not because iPhone 7 is bad but because much better iPhone is now just 6-7 months away. Some Jaw-dropping  rumors on iPhone 8  have already started flooding the internet. Now, we can be hopeful what we expected to see in iPhone 7 will be available on the iPhone 8. To list them out, hopefully, iPhone 8 will come with most-awaited OLED displays and wireless charging. Top of all, it will certainly have a new design. So, if you want to buy an iPhone to stand out the crowd then the iPhone 8 is worth all the wait.  What about the Xiaomi Phones in Nepal?   Mi Nepal  seems pretty aggressive\xa0in bringing Xiaomi phones in Nepal. They are releasing new Xiaomi devices one after another. Phones like Xiaomi Note 4, Redmi 4A, and discounted Mi5 are among the best buys from MI Nepal till the date. And, Yes the super hyped  Xiaomi Mi Mix  will be available in Nepal very soon. But should you buy the Mi Mix? The answer is a “No”. It is because it’s the first of its type and comes with few limitations. Yes, the phone is certainly gonna work as a head-turner when you use your phone in the public. But at the end of the day, it is just another over-priced phone with not so impressive specs considering its price. I’m pretty sure the bezel-less display is not gonna excite you rest of the days like the first time. Since there has already been news from Xiaomi working on Mi Mix2, it is rather wise to wait for the upgraded and refined second version.  What about Samsung?   Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, a year old device, is undoubtedly the best android phone you can buy in Nepal. That said, the next flagship from this Korean giant, the  Galaxy S8 , is just down the road. Trust me, buying the S7 edge now will be one of your regretful decisions in life. You’ll keep asking yourself why didn’t you wait for the greatest and latest Galaxy S lineup while buying new Samsung device in 2017.  And, if you’re planning to buy the Samsung Galaxy A7 2016, let me remind you Samsung Nepal will be releasing the Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 next month that will come at similar price range with heavier specs. So, the A7 2017 and the Galaxy C9 pro are among the next new releases from Samsung in Nepal.  Should you buy Gionee, Huawei phones now in Nepal?   MWC is just 10 days away, in which companies like Huawei, Gionee, and others will be introducing their new phones for the year 2017. So just wait, till they officially announce phones like Gionee A1/A1 plus, Huawei P10/P10 plus,  LG G6  and others in MWC. If you hold your next phone deal for a couple of weeks, maybe then you might find the right phone for you. MWC is all about new releases in Smartphone industries. Hence, buying a phone couple of weeks before MWC can be considered to be a stupidity.  When is the right time to buy a smartphone?  Well, if you’ve come this far how could I not share with you the best time to buy a smartphone? So, if you’re planning to buy your next smartphone in 2017 then mid of the year would be the best time. As then, every major OEMS will have introduced their flagships, midrange, and budget devices. It’s always nicer to have wider choices while choosing the best phone. But if you’re an iPhone enthusiast or a Galaxy Note user, then your wait will be a little longer than that of others. But trust me, this wait will be totally worth it.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/phones-in-nepal.jpg']

['The Selfie-Paradox: People hate looking at other people’s selfies but like posting their own'],['Opinion'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 12, 2017']",2017-02-12 14:19:13+00:00,"['Taking selfies – an act I hate doing. Yet, if you take a look at my gallery, you’ll probably find a few selfies I have taken.  Incidentally, a researcher has found out something similar. Sarah Diefenbach, a professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany, recently conducted a research to assess and know about people’s intentions and judgments while taking their selfies and also while viewing selfies of others.  What she found out was astonishing. Among the 238 people who participated in the survey, around 82 percent of people said that they would rather like to see ‘normal pictures’ on their social media feeds rather than selfies. But here’s the paradox – 77 percent of the study population said that they take selfies, and regularly.        In her interview with the Daily Mail, Diefenbach said, “One reason for this might be their fit with widespread self-presentation strategies such as self-promotion and self-disclosure.”  But why do people take selfies? What are their motives? “The selfie as a self-advertisement, plying the audience with one’s positive characteristics or the selfie as an act of self-disclosure, sharing a private moment with the rest of the world and hopefully earning sympathy, appear to be key motivators”, explains Sarah.  Writing this reminded me of an earlier article I had written on selfies.  When I wrote that article, I found out many researches which concluded that people who take selfies are narcissists and psychopaths. I (partially) agree with these studies. I think that people who post selfies on social medias are partly into self-promotion.  Sarah Diefenbach also mentions that selfies are categorized into three types: self-promotion, self-disclosure, and understatement. Self-promotion probably is self-explanatory and you might have seen a lot of pictures in that category. Simply, self-promotion is an advertisement done by the ‘selfie taker’ to show the viewers their positive features.  Self-disclosure comes second. Think of a person who has posted a private picture showing their messed up room or dishes left to wash. They are trying to gain some sympathy, aren’t they? This is an example of self-disclosure.  The third type of selfie is understatement. This is simply a selfie where people don’t show off anything but just portray themselves.  The study shows that people who fell under self-promotion and self-disclosure were more likely to take selfies than people who fell under the understatement category.  What do you think of the research’s findings? Let us know by commenting below. Meanwhile, I am off to pour my wrath on people who have posted their selfies. But first, let me take a selfie.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/huawei-gr5-mini-review-1.jpg']

Yes, that’ll have some remarkable changes in pricing. Hopefully, Xioami phones might get cheaper after they start using their own processors. Additionally, this initiative will give Xiaomi more degrees of flexibility towards integrating hardware and software.

Even if you don’t plan to buy the next iPhone, it’s still exciting to think what Apple is planning. Especially for all the Apple fanboys and us tech enthusiasts.  Now, going by the rumors and speculations Apple will be unveiling\xa03 iPhones this year. One of them is said to sport a 5.8 inch OLED screen which is supposed to cost $1000. The other two will probably have a 4.7 and a 5.5-inch IPS LCD screens.  The naming of these devices is a totally different story. We are not sure if Apple plans to name it the iPhone 7s/8 or X. The expensive one will most probably be the 8 or X.        Apple’s dream of seamless no ports or buttons iPhone will probably be a reality this year. This started with them removing the headphone jack and the home button in their current iPhones. This year Apple might finally introduce the first iPhone with a wireless charging capability. Then say bye bye to the lightning port (this is just my personal speculation).   Reports claim that Apple is looking to embed the Touch ID sensor and home button in the display itself. And no side buttons but instead touch-sensitive inlays and some 3D-sensing tech.  The main reason for the above $1000 price tag seems to be the new OLED display. OLED display costs a lot more than normal LCD displays. But then again they usually look better too. The second reason maybe the implementation of wireless charging and replacement of buttons with touch-sensitive\xa0inlays and embedded\xa0touch ID in the display.   Current top of the line iPhone 7plus 256GB costs $969. What do you think about the current speculations of an iPhone said to cost more than a $1000?\xa0Do take all the rumors and speculations with a\xa0grain of salt.

Yeah, the loud sounds don’t do much of harm if your ears aren’t exposed to them very often. But the impact of loud sounds and noises will certainly be felt in a long run. Your ears certainly do need protections if you work in a noisy environment. Say, if you work on a construction site or near roads with heavy traffic or loud music is what you work with, then you’re the one Flare Audio’s isolate is designed for. Isolate from Flare Audio is a revolutionary ear protector and let’s find out what makes it that revolutionary.  Everything you need to know about Isolate from Flare Audio   Isolate from Flare Audio is simply an earplug. When it comes to earplugs, what we have been seeing are the ones made from soft plastic or silicon. But this one\xa0is made out of metal (Aluminium or Titanium) and a soft foam. You might have a question regarding, sound isolator made out of metal? Isn’t metal good for sound conducting? Yes, you’re right. But the engineering used while designing these earplugs tells a different story. Its maker claim sounds are restricted to enter the ears as the metal and ear canals are completely isolated by the soft foam used.         Before the Flare Audio Isolate, we had two options: cheap non-electronic ear buds made out of plastic and silicon or expensive electronic ones that need to be recharged every so often. But Isolate is as good looking as electronic ones. Plus, they even give a\xa0nice touch to your ears with soft foams used. Plus, it has its inbuilt tightening mechanism once you twist them and put it into your ears, it starts fitting itself\xa0tight and snug.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b2THdYzBA0  \xa0  Who are those designed for?  When it comes to targetted audience of this product, well honestly they are not for everyone. You might grab a pair of those if you happen to perform in gigs and concert professionally. Plus, some concert lovers might wanna wear these if they want to bring down the loudness of the concert. Furthermore, if you have to deal with loudspeakers a lot like you work in a musical instrument store and every customer will be testing the instrument they will be buying. So, you might wanna protect your ears from possible damages since you’re hearing loud sounds on a daily basis. Say, if your partner snores while sleeping then you can’t make him/her stop it rather you can make yourself stop from hearing them snore. Besides musicians, construction site workers and traffic police are the potential buyers of these.  Where to Buy Flare Audio Isolate?  If you are interested in buy these revolutionary micro earplugs, you can buy them online from the link below. The pricing starts from $31.23 and goes up to\xa0$249.93 for special edition ones.

The first being, no physical home button on the front chin. And, a  more screen-to-body ratio \xa0with the edge-to-edge screen that Samsung started offering since the S6 edge. Unlike Apple, Samsung has found a spot to accommodate  a 3.5 headphone jack.  It sits on the left bottom edge of the phone. Similarly, the  USB type C  charging port is in the middle. Like its predecessor, the  mono loudspeaker  is placed at the right bottom edge. Is this a new color for Galaxy S8? Some are saying it to be same as the gold color that S7 comes with.

And with the ever growing industry, there are still some well-known brands that are still not officially present in Nepal. Here we will look at the 5 smartphone brands that aren’t currently officially available in Nepal.  Keep in mind that official availability is very important. The smartphone makers like HTC and Coolpad have just entered the Nepali market. This means that the smartphones from these makers will be officially available and they will be provided with an official warranty. Prev Next 1 Motorola         Motorola, also known as the makers of the first smartphone has had a very interesting past few years. Bought by Google for 12 billion and then sold to Lenovo for 2 billion. But still, haven’t forgotten to make good phones.  Motorola took the smartphone industry by storm when they released the Moto G. A budget phone with awesome specs. The same Moto G has reached its 4th generation. And their current flagship Moto Z have also stirred quite some interest with its modular capabilities. 2 Asus         Asus, a mostly known for their variety of laptops and high-end graphics cards also makes very good phones. They have some unique phones up their sleeves, like project tango supported phones.  They are soon to release Asus Zenfone AR which comes with the project Tango (Google’s new AR system). So now you can immerse yourself with both AR and VR. It also comes with a giant 8GB of RAM (world’s first) and a 23MP camera. Their flagship\xa0ZenFone 3 Deluxe also has a pretty awesome spec sheet with 6GB of RAM and top of the line Snapdragon 821. 3 VIVO         Vivo is one of the top 5 smartphone brands in the world in terms of sales. They are a Chinese brand with some exciting features and prices.  Their best seller Vivo V5Plus is one of the first smartphones to feature a dual front facing 20MP/8MP camera with flash. This phone sports a\xa0Snapdragon 625 CPU with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage with Dual-Charging Engine technology. It is already available in China and India. Their Vivo Xplay6 is their flagship phone with a curved edge screen just like on the Samsung\xa0Galaxy S7 edge and respectable specs sheet.  \xa0 4 Nokia         We all know Nokia and their whole story. Their 14 years of success and then their sudden downfall due to their decision to choose Windows OS instead of Android OS. Then their acquisition\xa0by Microsoft. But all that was the past. Now the company is now independent again. Although they do not have their own manufacturing resources anymore, their agreement with HMD Global has created an opportunity for them to release a new phone again.  Their new phone the Nokia 6 runs on Android Nougat. It’s a 5.5-inch \xa01080p screen with a snapdragon 430 CPU, 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage. The Nokia 6 is a mid-ranger priced at around $200 and has already caught a lot of attention. This new mid-ranger comeback\xa0phone from Nokia has been selling very fast that HDM Global cannot make enough units to fulfill all the demands. 5 Google         Google is one of the most popular names in the\xa0tech industry. They own everything from Youtube to Maps to Nexus. And in the middle of all that is Android. They bought Android in 2005 and has made it what it is today. They used to produce Nexus devices which were in association with some other manufacturer. Nexus were the examples of how android was supposed to be. Now for the first time in 2016, they have made a smartphone with their own branding. Although manufactured by HTC, these pixel phones are produced by Google and they take full credit.  The new Pixel and Pixel XL are 2 very unique phones from Google. Google says it has the best camera in any smartphone. With top of the line specs and a battery that will last you one whole day of usage. Google’s first phones are some of the best flagship phones you can buy in the market. This is the smoothest Android phone you can buy and with Google’s guaranty of 2 years of the latest and first in line software updates these phones were a huge hit. The only downside was the design of the phone which most people still complain about.

Constantly feeling the need to check your smartphone for every little ping or vibration, has a bulk of side effects added to it. Whether we accept it or not, we all are addicted to our smartphone to a certain extent. Besides having the urge to constantly tend to our smartphones for many reasons, that habit is not making our brains any stronger.  Needless to say, we all know one or many people who have some type of cellphone or smartphone near them at all times. There are people who can perform their everyday task without having a single social interaction, using their phones for every single activity. Understanding this mania for smartphones increasing rapidly every day, scientists and researchers have undergone several types of research and projects revealing astounding findings for a very long time. Studies, tests for smartphone addiction are still being carried out.  MIT professor and social psychologist: Sherry Turkle has discussed several issues regarding this matter, too. Including smartphones in our schedule, in our day to day activity, has changed our habits drastically. We have become intolerant of being alone. The constant need to keep stimulating our brains keeps coming back at us. Our ability to make calm, reflective decisions have been tarnished. Our connection with the technology has also obliterated has our attention span.        The constant stimulation to our brains might have been necessary when we were in the wild, which is not the case now. In order to make rational, proper decisions, we need to calm down which is not something we can do when we have constant pings of messages and notifications.\xa0To be constantly stimulated means we’re not fully in touch with our consciousness, and not really equipped to be rational.  Here are a few lines from “Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age” written by Sherry Turkle-   “This is our paradox. When we are apart: hyper-vigilance. When we are together: inattention.”  “Technology enchants; it makes us forget what we know about life… But in our eagerness, we forget our responsibility to the new, to the generation that follows us. It is for us to pass on the most precious thing we know how to do: talking to the next generation about our experiences, our history; sharing what we think we did right and wrong.”  “Even a silent phone disconnects us.”  “We miss out on necessary conversations when we divide our attention between the people we’re with and the world on our phones. Or when we go to our phones instead of claiming a quiet moment for ourselves. We have convinced ourselves that surfing the web is the same as daydreaming. That it provides the same space for self-reflection. It doesn’t.”  “There should be a good rule:  A good friend should keep you off of your phone when you are together.”  “Technology gives us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship.”   Maybe it has not been too late. We could all try one day at a time, and detach ourselves from the virtual world that surrounds us.

Additionally, with the approaching of release date, more leaks of LG G6 is found flooding the internet. In this post, we would like to dig deep into “LG G6 press invite”.  Will LG G6 have an edge-to-edge display?  This press invite claims LG G6 to have a big screen as expected. The LG G6 will have a\xa05.7-inch screen with QHD+ resolution and the aspect ratio will be of 18:9.

But Logitech’s newest webcam, the Brio Pro, has heated the tech industry again. Since it’s the World’s first 4K and HDR webcam one can have, it’s worldwide addresses can be considered obvious.  Logitech Brio 4k Pro Webcam  Let’s start with the price of this newest release from Logitech. This webcam is priced at 199USD which is a considerably high price for a webcam but what it offers makes it worth the price. The Brio shoots videos in Ultra HD (UHD) resolution (4096 x 2160) at 30 fps, or in 1080p at 60 fps. When it comes to a webcam, they are the ones we use inside a room. In regular conditions, rooms are mostly under-lit. But if you own this webcam, lighting conditions are something you shouldn’t ever worry about.

And now, the device has been spotted on Wi-Fi Alliance website, thus confirming its existence and the possibility that we could be witnessing the launch of the Galaxy C5 Pro soon. Termed as ‘SM-C501X’, the smartphone could be the perfect device for someone looking for a powerful and compact mid-ranger.

Then you can control the drone through the app.        We took the high-end stabilizing technology and minimized it into an accessory used everyday by everyone — a cellphone case  How good is the camera?  Kickstarted Selfly drone  There is basically an 8-megapixel camera that can also do 1080p video recording at 30 fps. You can point it in any direction you want from the app itself. They are promising a high-end\xa0stabilizing technology as the drone will be flying while taking your selfies.  Current status  As of January 24, 2017, the project has been launched thanks to the 2,658 backers collecting an amount of\xa0$275,664 for the project from Kickstarter.  A phone case?  Yes, Selfly drone will also double as your phone case. The case that holds the drone can be easily altered to fit 4-6 inch phone. And if you happen to own an iPhone6, 6 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, Galaxy s6 edge, S7, S7 edge, or a Nexus 6 your device will be getting a dedicated case.  Software  The company said that they are looking to enable an open developer platform so that anyone can program commands for the drone. Other than that the drone will be controlled by an app on your phone. They will also be adding\xa0facial recognition technology in the near future.  Hardware  The Selfly drone is going to be 9mm thick. That’s\xa09mm added to your existing smartphone. This isn’t the worst thing but it’s till very bulky. Other than that it has 640mAH battery inside. That really small providing about 5 minutes of flying time. Now, the company’s CEO hopes to add wireless charging to the drone. Other than that there’s a Micro USB port. The drone is also very noisy. That will be an issue depending on the situation.  overview of selfly drone  Pricing and availability  The drone will cost $100 on Kickstarter, and $140 retail. Now for Nepal, this price might hike a bit. It’s expected to start shipping in June this year  Verdict  Backed through Kickstarter\xa0it’s a really great idea and that with the help of backers this idea is coming to reality. The usefulness of this device will depend on the personal preference but it’s always great that these ideas exist and with the help of Kickstarter these ideas get to come out in the real world.

With frequent to and fro communication; we finally got the chance to contact Mr. Lawrence, Regional Director- Coolpad South Asia. Here are some few questions we put forward to him:  Q. Hello Sir, now that we have got the leaks that Coolpad is looking to serve Nepali Market as well, lets us get started with an obvious question, which is in every enthusiast’s mind right now:\xa0 When is Coolpad launching its smartphones in Nepal? Could you please tell us the models that will be launched?   Mr. Lawrence  – Hello, sorry for the delayed response. I hope you understand the protocols however I will try my best to answers your queries. On regarding the launch date, we are excited to launch soon in Nepal, our team is working on it. We have chosen our best products from the lineup to officially enter the Nepalese market. Some of them are Coolpad Note 5, Mega 2.5D etc        Q. Do you think the Coolpad Products are the right ones for Nepali Market? If yes, would you please elaborate?  Mr. Lawrence  – Coolpad is one of the top listed Global brands. For Nepal, I believe and have noticed that consumer goes for quality and design. And undoubtedly, we have the best quality products. Nepalese customers are upgrading in lifestyle with the latest technology and Coolpad is very strong in R&D with more than 3000 strong R&D experts globally. So, we will definitely release latest and innovative product in Nepal also.  Q. What are your strategies to win greater market space in lesser time? As you surely know that there are lots of multinational brands already in the market.  Mr. Lawrence  – To start with this question, Coolpad had been studying Nepalese market as well as the behavior of the other smartphone brand closely. We look forward to applying the global experiences in Nepal market. As another market, we are committed to providing the best product to our Nepalese consumer.  Q. If you had to choose one out of many, which mobile company does you see as a tough competitor to the Coolpad, especially in South Asia?  Mr. Lawrence  – We take every MNC companies as competitors but not tough competitors. We will show our presence in Nepal as a strong player. We have the young and best team for Nepal market.  Q. We all know how well Xiaomi turned Indian Mobile Market upside down. So can you expect Coolpad to do such thing here in Nepal?  Mr. Lawrence  – Coolpad has the aggressive business expansion strategy for the year 2017. It is an opportunity to lead the Nepal market with our strong partner. We always keep Nepal market at top priority. I hope our young team does great thing in Nepal also.  Q. Lately, Nepali customers are disappointed to find mobile companies pricing their phones higher in Nepal as compared to the international market. Will Coolpad break that trend for us and price its products the same as in international market?  Mr. Lawrence  – First, we should be clear why price difference endures from one market to another market. One reason for the price difference is obviously online and offline channels. Coolpad in India is doing business exclusively with our online partner Amazon. But, Nepal market is an offline market. So, offline markets have multiple layers of distribution channels which add the cost of the product. On the other hand, price depends on the volume. But, we won’t make our Nepal customer disappointed with the price.  Q. Amongst the entire product line up from Coolpad, which one is your favorite?  Mr. Lawrence  – Haha! Each and Every product of Coolpad are manufactured following standard criteria. So, every product is special and favorite for me. I am using Cool 1 which is the best\xa0smartphone.  Thank you very much for your time and responding to our email. As the New Year is very near, we, from the team of Gadget Bytes Nepal would like to wish you a Happy New Year, and we, the tech-gadget enthusiasts are excited to have you in Nepal.  Mr. Lawrence  – Thank you again, I hope I met your requirements. Happy New year to all Nepalese and Gadget byte Nepal.

The event was scheduled on 27th Jan. at Soaltee Crowne Plaza.  CG 4K Smart TV (65″, UHD, 1GB RAM, 4GB ROM, 1.5 GHz dual core CPU and quad core GPU)        1  of 3                                                This is the first 4K TV from CG, a national brand. CG has been launching many LED smart TVs in the past. When it comes to CG TVs, they are comparatively cheaper as compared to those from MultiNational Brands. And, CG maintains competitive quality standards as well. That is why if you’re on a budget it is always wiser to have CG in your option while buying your next TV.  Coming to the specs of this newly released 65-inch model with Ultra High Definition (UHD) resolution, it boxes a 1.5GHz Dual Core CPU and Quad Core GPU inside. Along with that, it has a 1GB RAM and 4GB internal memory. Unspecified picture engine is used to enhance the picture quality. According to CG, an “A+ Panel” is used that produces awesome picture quality with the brightness of 350nits. They added, “users can experience quality sounds coming from the special speaker box used inside.”        When\xa0it comes to TV, users are curious to know the number and types of ports it has. In this model, the TV comes with most of the ports we look forward to. It has 4 USB ports, 3 HDMI ports, RJ45 port, VGA port,\xa0one Tuner Input and one Tuner output port, composite video output and L/R audio output ports.  Should you buy a 4K TV?  Well, it isn’t an easy of a question. It has two answers depending on the person raising the question.  The first answer is a “No” if you’re on a budget and want to just buy a good TV for your current need Full HD TVs are good enough for you. At the end of a day, the most of the contents you’ll be playing on our TVs are likely to be a Full HD one.  But, the best answer might be a “Yes” if you take your electronic expense as an invest. It’s always wiser to invest on something futuristic. That way, you won’t have a need to buy another TV after few years when TV channels start broadcasting in 4K. Plus, many YouTube contents are now in 4k as well. If you have a stable and faster internet connection then 4K smart TVs are just right for you. As far as we know, a new DTH named HamroTV is coming with 4k channels. It might be a good option for gamers too, provided that they have a good system. Playing games in 4K? I’d love to join you.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cg-led-4k-tv.jpg']

Starting with its first generation, the G-series has been people’s choice for its bang-for-buck pricing. The powerful build quality and stock-ish UI of the smartphones from G-series come second to none in their pricing.  Last year’s  Moto G4 and G4  Plus were quite decent in all-around performance, build, camera, and UI among others. While they were released mid-year in 2016, it looks as though Lenovo will be revealing the newest members of the G-series, the Moto G5, and G5 Plus, at MWC 2017.  While we can’t guarantee the exact specifications the device will feature, we can surely tell you some rumored specifications that have been surfacing on the internet for quite some time now.        Now let’s talk some specs! The Moto G5 and G5 Plus could come with 3GB and 4GB of RAM respectively, with both devices featuring 32GB of onboard storage. Others specifications will probably be similar. One listing suggests the Moto G5 Plus to feature a 5.5-inch display with the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor clocked at 2.0GHz. The processor will be coupled with an Adreno 506 GPU. Camera wise, the device will be equipped with a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. The battery will probably calculate to 3000 mAh.\xa0 It will most likely be supported with Lenovo’s Turbo Charging mechanism. Also, it will support NFC too. While both the devices will likely share most of the specs, Moto G5 will probably feature a 5-inch display and come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC under the hood.  Reports suggest that both these devices could go on sale right after MWC.  Up until now, Motorola (yes, I still call it Motorola) has priced the devices of the G-series right. But in 2017, there could be a lot of manufacturers who could be selling devices with similar specifications at a cheaper price. So, the company should keep that in mind while launching their device.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/moto-g5-plus-leaked-image-GBN.jpg']

['Reports: Nokia isn’t releasing its flagship P1 in February'],"['Android', 'Nokia']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 5, 2017']",2017-02-05 09:33:45+00:00,"['After getting  sold out in under a minute , we can confirm that Nokia’s finally back. Yes, HMG Global, the company that owns rights to sell smartphones under Nokia’s name, isn’t the same company. However, it still takes input from Nokia’s former officials.  After making a huge mistake by opting for Windows operating system in 2011, Nokia started to lose its market share and charm. With Android and Apple smartphones making impacts all around the world, Nokia sold itself to Microsoft.  However, even though most people had suggested that Nokia was done for, it made a comeback couple of months ago with the Nokia 6. And, if reports are considered, HMD Global isn’t stopping there. The Finnish company is set to launch two more Android smartphones this year, Nokia Heart and Nokia P1.        Talking about the Nokia Heart, the device could be a toned down version of the Nokia 6. It will probably be launched at Mobile World Congress 2017. If rumors are considered, it will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC that is clocked at 1.4GHz underneath the hood. The processor will supposedly be aided with 2GB of RAM and Adreno 505 GPU. Optics wise, it is said that the Nokia Heart will be equipped with a 13-megapixel primary and 8-megapixel secondary camera. It could feature 16GB of onboard storage. The device will surely run on Android 7.0 Nougat.  Before talking about the Nokia P1, let’s talk about the rumors circulating about  Nokia 8 . Right after CES ended, a YouTuber shared a video which said that Qualcomm had showcased Nokia’s flagship for 2017, the Nokia 8. However, as the story unfolded, Qualcomm denied displaying the Nokia 8. A spokesperson at Qualcomm said, “We do not disclose details of our reference design. We’ve seen a few stories rumoring what we demonstrated in our CES booth to be a Nokia device. Those reports are not accurate; our 836 demos were on our reference design devices, which we use to demo our latest Snapdragon SoCs every year.”  So, what we have been hearing about the Nokia 8 seems to be all wrong.  But where does the Nokia P1 fit in exactly? Well, it looks like the device might be featuring some of the rumored specifications that had circulated about the Nokia 8. The P1 will probably feature Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor that could be coupled with 6GB of RAM. Display wise, it might feature a 5.3-inch qHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) display. It has been said to come with IP57 protection and Gorilla Glass 5. Camera wise, it could be equipped with a 22.6-megapixel Carl Zeiss lens. A 3,500mAh battery could be backing up the Nokia P1.   Well, previously it was thought that HMD Global could be launching their flagship device for 2017 at MWC. But since Samsung has made it clear that the Galaxy S8 will be the first device to feature the chipset, the Finnish company will probably unveil the P1 after the S8 is launched.  Since the Nokia P1 is a flagship device, we can expect the pricing to rise up to around $950 for 256GB variant.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nokia.jpg']
['The OnePlus 3 gets a price drop in Nepal'],['OnePlus'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['February 5, 2017']",2017-02-05 07:09:56+00:00,"['iHub Pvt. Ltd., the authorized distributor of OnePlus products in Nepal has dropped the price of\xa0 OnePlus 3\xa0 recently. It is the same phone that was out of stock in Nepal a\xa0few months ago. And, OnePlus has stopped its manufacturing as well. The new price of OnePlus 3 in Nepal is Rs. 45,900. The price drop is of flat NRs. 4,000 from the initial launching price. Well, this price drops raises few questions?? Why the price-drop? Has the distributor already generated more revenue than expected? Or, is the phone sales going not\xa0good at all? Or, is it the stock clearance before the upgraded OnePlus 3T gets revealed?  Verdict  Well, we didn’t bother asking the iHub for the reason behind the price drop. After all, the\xa0price drop is always a good thing from the customer’s point of view. However, this price drop gives us some hints on the date of OnePlus 3T launching in Nepal getting closer. This price drop might be something unplanned but obvious. The main reason might be, the possible customers keeping themselves on hold from buying OnePlus 3 since it’s upgraded version is certain to be launched in Nepal at an obviously higher price and comes with appreciable upgrades. “If you can buy the OnePlus 3T shortly, why to buy the One plus 3 now?” said a friend of mine. He was almost buying the OP 3 but it was out of stock at the moment. Now, He’s like if I’ve waited this long, OnePlus 3T is still worth another month of wait. That said, OnePlus 3 is still a good buy for those who are into an affordable specs-heavy phone. Considering this price drop, if you were planning to buy OnePlus 3, it is the right time to get one.

These Card Readers are placed near the door where you need to insert your card when riding and getting off the bus, then the system will automatically\xa0take the fare based on your travel. \xa0 This system seems pretty cool, not having to deal with spare change and just simply going to your commute without any hassle. The systems are already in place but to make use of it, Sajha Yatayat still has to make the Travel Card available to the public which they will in the coming weeks.The system is currently on test with only limited number of users.        Smart Travel Card will be priced Rs.200 and will hold a Rs.50 balance. You can easily cash the amount you want on your travel card from the Sajha Yatayat Office, or if the cash balance runs out you can recharge by paying the bus driver as well.

Among the five, two of them now are available for purchase right away. The two products that arrived on the market are DAX wallet and Levit8 (Portable Laptop Stand). They are currently available on Sastodeal (Sammy’s online partner) and Lowest Retailer (Sammy’s Offline Partner in Kathmandu Valley).  DAX Wallet   DAX Wallet is a slim and nifty wallet with water repellant body. It consists of five thin plastic compartments to keep track of your cards (visiting cards, identity card, credit cards, etc). The name wallet does not hold true if it just holds cards. So, in order to hold the money, a small pocket has also been provided. This wallet is also provided with a small magnetic strip, which adheres with another magnet attached to the wallet and locks it. This lock prevents the falling of cards from the compartments. This wallet is thin and light too, and hence avoids the conspicuous sag and lump on your pocket. DAX Wallet is available on SastoDeal with blue, gray and orange color variants and cost Rs. 950 for a one.         Levit8 (Portable Laptop Stand)   Nowadays, many of us use laptops. And the back pain due to incorrect posture while using them is another big problem. This problem not only keeps us tired but also decreases our productivity. To help us get away with this problem, a group of creative designers came up with an idea of Levit8. Levit8 seems like a fatter version of a leaflet, which can turn into a portable laptop stand. The leaves of the Levit8 should be crossed and twisted to make it a laptop stand. On this stand, more than twenty laptops can be adjusted. This laptop stand is lighter in weight. So you will not feel burden while carrying it. In addition, the material used in this laptop stand is water repellent and stain free. So you can also use this laptop stand as a shield to protect your laptop. On the SastoDeal, there are three variants of Levit8 available and the respective cost of them are Rs. 2,290, Rs. 2,590 and Rs. 2,890 respectively.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dax-levit8-nepal.jpg']

However, it was certain that prepaid users could upgrade to 4G but the date wasn’t certain till yesterday. Now, any prepaid users within a network of Kathmandu and Pokhara can upgrade to 4G service.  How to activate 4G in NTC (Prepaid/Postpaid)   Activating 4G is simple. All you need to do is go to your phone dialer and dial ”  *444#  “. A new dialog box will appear asking you to enter “1” to confirm. After the moment you press 1 and hit send, you’ll get a notification message from NTC.

['Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro Review: Bigger is better?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['February 3, 2017']",2017-02-03 17:42:14+00:00,"['The Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro is the latest premium smartphone from the Korean giants. It has a 6-inch display, 6 GB of RAM, and Snapdragon 652 processor. It will go on sale in a matter of weeks here in Nepal for an expected price of around 55 to 60K.  We got to use the device for two days. So, here is our quick review to find out if this phone is worth all your money.  Design  The Galaxy C9 Pro is a handsome lad and easily the best looking Samsung device that I have ever held in my hands. It houses a metal back giving a premium feeling. The device is thin and carries a bit of weight. At the front, the Galaxy C9 Pro sports a tall 6-inch display. Even for its huge display size, I had no problem using the device. It sure is ergonomically built.         \xa0  The display is\xa0accompanied by a primary camera and an earpiece along with accelerometer, proximity, light and gyro sensors. I was really surprised with Samsung’s choice here as the company adds all these sensors only in its the high-end flagship devices.\xa0The front part edges out with 2.5D curved gorilla glass making the device look seamless. The home button on the bottom chin doesn’t bulge out like previous Samsung smartphones and fits in perfectly into the chin. It also serves as a fingerprint sensor. The volume rockers and power button sit on the left and right side of the device. The Galaxy C9 Pro features a speaker at the bottom. And yes, it does come with a headphone jack.  Display  The Galaxy C9 Pro flaunts a tall 6-inch Super AMOLED 1080p display with 367 for the PPI. The display looks bright, colorful and well saturated – thanks to its super AMOLED panel. Unlike previous Samsung smartphones, the Galaxy C9 Pro comes with an auto brightness adjusting function, that auto-adjusts the brightness level in accordance to the lighting. I had no problem in using the device in a bright environment. And the best part is the inclusion of Always on Display.   Software  Talking about the software, the Galaxy C9 Pro comes with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box with TouchWiz UI on top of it. It is commendable that the Korean giants have now opted for a toned down version of TouchWiz in their devices. While I am more inclined towards stock Android experience, I had now problem using the interface. The C9 Pro comes with little bloatware which was kind of useful. It also supports multi-window mode which goes well with the huge 6-inch display. And it has already been confirmed that the device will get Android Nougat update. All in all, for me, the software experience was top-notch and snappy.  \xa0  Performance  The Galaxy C9 Pro comes with an Octa-core Snapdragon 653 processor clocked at 1.9GHz. Considering its price range, the company should have at least went with the Snapdragon 820/821 SoC. Also, the device features Adreno 510 GPU. It would have been better if Samsung had chosen Adreno 530 GPU, as it performs better during gaming. Nonetheless,\xa0I got no lags and stutters while during my time of using the device. The C9 Pro could handle everything, from heavy gaming to using tons of apps at the same time, thanks to its 6GB RAM.  \xa0  Hardware  On the hardware side, the device features 64GB of onboard storage that can be expanded up to 256GB via microSD card. Samsung seems to have listened to its users as the device comes with a dedicated microSD slot. The mono speaker on the C9 Pro is only decent. For its connectivity, it has a USB Type-C connector that supports fast charging which is really necessary due to the large battery it comes with. The fingerprint scanner of the device is fast and is probably even faster than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It works perfectly and I had no hiccups unlocking the device. The C9 Pro supports 4G connectivity with its dual Nano SIM.  \xa0  Camera  On specs sheet, the Galaxy C9 pro is equipped with a 16-megapixel rear and front camera, both with f/1.9 aperture. The pictures come out bright, sharp and well saturated in a well-lit environment. The rear camera is equipped with dual tone LED flash which helped in balancing the lighting of objects and their background. The device, however, doesn’t do well in a dark environment as the pictures come out over-exposed and quite grainy. I also didn’t like the fact that it doesn’t shoot 4K videos. The front camera is perfect for selfie lovers. It takes sharp and bright images. Like most of its devices, Samsung has included the palm gesture to take pictures. The camera app comes with some inbuilt editing effects.  Battery  Under the hood, the C9 Pro comes with a huge 4000 mAh battery which will last for a couple of days under normal usage. Add this with Samsung’s built-in ‘S power planning’ and you won’t be searching for your charger for a few days. And thanks to its fast battery charging, I could charge up the battery in a short time period.   Early Verdict  So, to conclude the C9 Pro is a quite decent smartphone. It is a tall phablet that even for its size, is easier to use. The design is excellent and the device feels top-notch. And with 6GB of RAM, you sure won’t be facing any lags. This device is meant for those who like using big displays for gaming and multimedia experience. Even though its camera isn’t of a flagship standard, it is a good buy considering its price range.']",[]

It’ll certainly get a comeback with the release of the next galaxy, the Galaxy S8. But, that won’t be enough. Lately, it’s losing the image of providing considerable midrange phone at cheaper prices. The availability of Specs heavy phones at cheaper price from different Chinese manufacturers made Samsung lose its market share worldwide. The J series family of smartphones did great but Samsung wants them to do even better. Samsung is looking forward to selling 100 million units of smartphone from Galaxy J family worldwide.  It might sound challenging but is possible. Samsung is adding the fourth J7 in its J-series family and it’s the Samsung Galaxy J7 2017. Well, it is only recently that we started to see renders of its new design. Now, the leaked benchmark details made us be more confident about its release more than ever.  Samsung Galaxy J7 2017 (design render and leaked specs)         The design render shows a fresh design for the next Samsung Galaxy J7. It looks easy to spot from rest of its predecessors with that gray strip along the camera module which might as well double as antenna lines. Like J7 prime, the loudspeaker is placed on the right top edge of the device. Rumors say the phone might come with some water resistance that’ll be a most welcome feature in a midrange phone.  What is more interesting than its design render is its leaked benchmark details. That detail gives us a glimpse on what the phone will be packing inside.  \xa0Looking at the specs in the test benchmark records made us scrub our heads. As it is in conflict with rumored specs. Earlier, Samsung Galaxy J7 2017 was rumored to pack a 3GB RAM but here it shows up as if that’ll be of 2GB only. However, Samsung might be releasing two variants of this phone depending on the region. What we can be sure of is, the phone will come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. It’ll be powered by an Octa-core\xa0processor from Qualcomm that’ll be clocked at 2.2Ghz or the Exynos 7870 SoC. Plus, the rumor says\xa0it is Qualcomm SnapDragon 626. It’ll be a 5.5 inch full HD LCD panel just like its predecessors. Nonetheless, it won’t have a fingerprint sensor and many might find it disappointing. Additionally, the camera units will be the same 13MP at back and 5MP on the front.  Honestly speaking, I wanted the next Galaxy J7 to sport a fingerprint sensor. Let’s wish the rumor about no fingerprint sensor will turn out to be just rumor. Design-wise, the phone looks compelling but how well it’ll feel while holding is something we can say only after getting our hands on it, hopefully, this spring.

"['Lava A3 Review: Should you buy it for Rs. 25,000?']","['Lava', 'Reviews', 'Smartphone Review']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['February 3, 2017']",2017-02-03 07:44:35+00:00,"['The Indian smartphone brand Lava has been in the Nepali smartphone market for quite a while. Lava has been providing low-end mobiles and smartphones for the Nepali users. However, now Lava has been expanding its horizon and toiling to provide mid-range phones. It has recently brought a Lava A3 phone, which is packed with greater specs as compared to its previous models. And this smartphone probably is the first mid-range phone in the Lava family. This new device costs Rs. 25,000 in Nepali market.\xa0The manufacturers have claimed that the device comes with greater specs and the slogan ‘Never miss a detail’ justifies it.\xa0So, in order to dig the truth, \xa0l et’s explore what is inside the phone and let’s find out if the phone worth the price and worth a buy.  Design\xa0  Lava A3 includes sleek metallic back with carefully placed and convincingly colored plastic caps on the top and bottom of the phone. Though provided with an Aluminum body, the phone is light in weight.         The device is thin, which has added elegance to its design. The curved edges have eased the user to hold the device with a single hand. However, the smooth and soft finish has made the device somewhat slippery. This can, however, be avoided with the addition of skins or back cover to the device. The device also lacks capacitive touch buttons on the chin. However, the on-screen buttons will help you do the job anyway.  Display\xa0  Lava A3 comes with a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The presence of Gorilla Glass has made the device secure from cracks and scratches. However, the presence of IPS LCD when the other devices are furnishing OLED, Optic AMOLED and Super AMOLED displays has made the Lava A3 somewhat obsolete. The device’s display includes 720p (HD) resolution. As most of the devices in this price segment are available with Full HD resolution, this feature might be the reason to pull back  Lava A3 in the race.  However, this resolution slows down the battery consumption and hence provides greater battery backup. On the contrast side, the phone has low contrast ratio. The minimum brightness of the device saves you from the eyestrain. However, in the broad daylight, even with the full brightness, your eyes have to struggle to view the display. The phone comes with auto brightness option, which saves your time of frequently changing display brightness while being on indoors and outdoors. The screen drawback also includes the lack of color saturation in which the true color disguises.  Hardware  Moving on, the device includes circular slot fingerprint scanner on the back, placed right below the camera and LED flash. Lava A3 is furnished with speaker grills on the bottom. There is a single speaker installed to the device, however, two grills are provided for the sake of symmetry. The audio quality of the device is good to the speaker and even on the earphone, however; the sound is not loud enough to struggle in a sonorific environment. The hardware also includes the power button, volume buttons and the charging slot, which is placed on the right, left and bottom of the device respectively. The volume keys and power key are well placed with a suitable distance between them providing the ease even to press them simultaneously when desired. The hardware also includes a tiny LED on the top, which physically reminds you about the notifications by blinking.    Software\xa0  On the software, Lava A3 is favored by Android Marshmallow 6.0 and flavored by Star OS 3.3 on the top. The UI of the device is not of the top-notch quality. When I was using the phone, the UI failed to impress me. The lack of app drawer became the problem at first; however, after the installation of a launcher, that absence was never felt. Out of the box, the device does come with some bloatware, which is useful and easily removable if unwanted. The device also includes smart gesture and custom gesture option for the users, which in addition to ease, provide the users to turn their scribbles into the meaningful tasks to the device.         1  of 3                                                Performance\xa0  The device is powered by Mediatek MT6750 chipset, which is an Octa-core processor running at the clock speed of 1.5 GHz. The graphics portion is taken care by the Mali-T860 GPU. The device also comes with the 32 GB of internal memory, which can be expanded with the use of SDcard (upto 64GB). 32 GB is a good amount, however, nearly one-fourth of the internal memory is devoured by the system. This could be the reason to make you fall short while storing your data. The phone also inherits 3 GB DDR3 RAM. The GPU and RAM assembly has done a great job on the device. Even running multiple high-end games, I found no glitches on my play and the performance was lag free. However, there was a heating issue, when the games were played for long.   Battery\xa0  Out of the box, the device comes with 3020 mAh non-removable battery. It provides a greater backup on standby and normal use, though, it could betray you being out of charge on the heavy usage. I noticed a quick draining of battery while playing the high-end games. Though the battery served me with an around of five hours of backup even while playing high-end games with my Wi-Fi on. The device also lacks Quick charging technology and indulges itself with the wall-charger for a long time to gain the full charge.   Camera\xa0  The camera of the phone is top notch. The 13 MP Sony sensor on the back does a good job with the photos. The camera comes with many options. The camera option includes Gif mode, intelligent selfie, template, sound picture and QR code scanner options, which is a rare feature to be seen in a smartphone camera. In addition, the camera also includes a Bokeh option. The nifty photograph with the option set to Bokeh effect reminded me of some high-quality digital camera. Though the camera is greatly built, we can experience conspicuous grain on the photos shot in the low light. This can be somewhat avoided by shooting photos with the flash on.  On the front, the device includes an 8 MP shooter. Following the footsteps of the rear, the front one too shoots great photos. Even on the low light, the LED flash ensures the clarity and sharpness in the picture. To avoid the blurry and shaky images, the camera is flowered by EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) and phase detection autofocus. While taking videos, the front one is capable of taking VGA videos and the rear one capable of shooting FHD videos. The cameras are also capable of taking customized fast motion videos in the speed interval of 2x to 10x. Both cameras on the phones in the similar price section are capable of shooting Full HD video in the least. So the video resolution of the device failed to dazzle me.  Connectivity  For the cellular connectivity, the phone carries a SIM card tray near the power button. The device is capable of having two SIMs standby. However, this will cut you from the privilege of expanding your storage by the use of SDcard. The phone also encourages 4G compatibility, which is a good news as 4G is now available in Nepal. Other connectivity option includes A-GPS, Bluetooth, Radio and Wi-Fi 802.11 (b/g/n). However, the lack of dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac and OTG cable compatibility is not convincing in this price segment.   Fingerprint\xa0  Lava A3 Back View  The sensitivity of the fingerprint sensor in this device is the most astounding feature on the Lava A3. The unlocking of the device will take 0.16 seconds. Putting my finger on the rear-mounted circular slot of fingerprint scanner unlocks the device almost instantaneously. This could probably be the most sensitive fingerprint sensor in this price range. This nifty fingerprint sensor might turn out to lure the customers to buy Lava A3.  Conclusion\xa0  In the overall, Lava A3 is a great device. The\xa0toils done by the Lava to step up itself from low-end budget devices to the mid-range range device of this quality deserves a due respect. The device’s metallic design, snappy fingerprint scanner, stunning camera, astounding hardware, and performance will not fail to impress you. Display, battery, and software have a place for improvement.\xa0They may fall short in the specs as compared to other devices in the price range. However, they are not that disappointing to push you to engulf in the regrets. I will not call it great but this device could definitely be a good buy in this price segment.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lava-a3-8.jpg']

The lawsuit was filed against Facebook-owned Oculus for allegedly stealing the intellectual property of ZeniMax.  Oculus has been charged for- copyright infringement ($50 million), failure to comply with a non-disclosure agreement ($200 million), and misuse of Oculus trademarks ($50 million). Also, former Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe must also pay $150 million, and current CEO Palmer Luckey must pay $50 million — both for false designation.  ZeniMax has claimed that\xa0Oculus founder Palmer Luckey had exploited the Zenimax computer code and trade secrets in order to develop its products. It also said that Oculus’ VR device Oculus Rift was very much lacking until John Carmack, Oculus chief technology officer and founder of a company owned by ZeniMax, improved on the device using his knowledge from his previous work as a ZeniMax employee.        Zenimax – the parent company of id Software which has produced iconic video games such as Doom – has claimed that Facebook had purchased Oculus with ‘full awareness’ that Carmack had indeed stolen the technology. However, Facebook CEO -Mark Zuckerberg had testified in court stating that he had no idea whatsoever about the intellectual property claims between Oculus and ZeniMax.  Anthony Sammi, ZeniMax lawyer has stated that they are pleased with the jury’s award in this case as it reflects the damage done to the company as the result of the theft of their intellectual property. They have also hinted at seeking proper steps to ensure that there will no longer be any use of their misappropriated technology.  Facebook has said that they are, indeed,\xa0disappointed by a few aspects of the verdict, but they are undeterred. They have stated that their belief and commitment to the long-term success of VR still remains the same, and the entire team will continue the work they’ve done since day one. They are looking forward to filing an appeal and eventually putting litigation behind them while moving forward to develop a VR that is, simply put, beyond ordinary; and will change how people interact and communicate.  Virtual reality has been a subject of vast approach, scheme, and ideas for the past few decades. Oculus Rift has definitely set the notch up a bit. From the latest reviews, one can clearly know that the Oculus’ attempt in VR, will certainly not go unnoticed. The experience provided by this innovation has genuinely surpassed many of the VR experiences, undoubtedly. But what affect will this lawsuit have against Oculus, against Facebook? We will all have to wait and see.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fb.png']

Many of his YouTube subscribers might have mistaken his name to be Jerry which is not. Those who already know him might have an idea of what he does in the durability tests. For those who don’t, I would like to give a quick walkthrough. He starts with testing of the screen for scratch tests followed by heat test on the screen. Then he checks the material used in the build of the phone. Before doing the bend test, the durability of earpiece material and protecting glass used in cameras are also put to the test.  Zack’s Durability Test on Huawei Honor 6X/ GR5 2017 Explained   In his latest YouTube video, Zack performed a durability test on the Honor 6x. If the phone name Honor 6x sounds new to you, it is same as Huawei GR5 2017. In short, the phone failed badly in his durability test and ended up in his “Shelf of Shame”. The screen gets scratched pretty easily as the protecting glass used isn’t a Gorilla Glass. The screen starts getting scratches at the Level 2 of Zack’s hardness tool whereas many other phones’ screens only start having marks at the level 4 in the earliest.              1  of 3                                                On the bright side, the metallic grill over the earpiece is a durable one as compared to fabric materials. The plastic panels at the top and bottom of the phone will be a good player for shock absorption in case of occasional drops. Zack peeled off the plastics used in volume rockers and power button. Well, the Honor 6X is a budget phone and\xa0its build quality was no exception. Nonetheless, the back is made out of metal as expected.  When a phone is made out of metal, it is expected to be a sturdy one. Despite the metal back,\xa0Zack easily bent the honor 6X in his bend test. The bending didn’t crack the protecting glass but the LCD couldn’t survive it. Anyways, It is the same LCD that survived the heat test for up to 12seconds and recovered effortlessly. Zack mentioned the reason behind this bending\xa0to be the back metal not being screwed\xa0to the phone’s chassis.  As you can see from JerryRigEverything, the honor 6x failed the durability test of Zack Nelson. Hence, the phone has found its place in Zack’s Shelf of Shame along with other phones like Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.  Is Huawei GR5 2017 still a good buy?  Well, this durability test’s result was a disappointing one. The phone gets scratches easily and will bend without much of effort. Yes, they are problems but they have easy fixes as well. Your GR5 2017 will last longer if you handle it with care. All you need to have after you buy this phone is a quality tempered glass and a good phone case. The specs it offers and its performance as a daily driver and the promising cameras it has got\xa0easily overshadowed this durability test for me. In my personal preference, Huawei GR5 2017 is still a good buy for a phone under 30k in Nepal.

The expo started from 27 th  of January and is going to end on 4 th  of February.  “Because of the CAN InfoTech 2017, the visitors seems to be diverted.

"['OTTO Mark Smartphone with 3GB RAM, Fingerprint Sensor Launched']",['Otto'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['February 1, 2017']",2017-02-01 12:44:26+00:00,"['Jaima InterContinental Pvt. Ltd (JIPL), launched OTTO Mark today in an event at Tamrakar Complex, New Road. The event seemed a little confusing right from its title “Loot2 presents OTTO Mark”. Was it a phone launch or a movie promo? Well, that’s the question I couldn’t have an answer to even after attending the event.  OTTO Mark (Specs Breakdown)  The Otto Mark is a metal unibody phone made from aluminum alloy that is 8.6mm thick. It has a 6-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1280*720. Hence the display has 245PPI. Since Human eye can discern granular details under 300PPI, you can read individual pixels in this phone if you want to. Just keep in mind, bigger is not always better. The phone comes with 3GB RAM and 32GB ROM which sounds impressive considering its price segment.      Otto Mark    1  of 5                                                                           For phone photography enthusiasts, the camera units sound promising on paper with 13MP at back and 8 MP on the front. This huge screen phone is backed with a considerably huge battery of 3845mAh. The phone supports fast charging of 5V, 2 Amp. The phone runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with an unknown skin layered on top.  Like many phones these days, Otto Mark does come with fingerprint sensor with 360-degree recognition. This sensor claims\xa0to unlock the phone at 0.3 seconds at the fastest. For wireless connectivity, it has WiFi 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0. As far as other sensors are concerned, it comes equipped with GPS/A-GPS and Gyro-Sensor for VR gaming. This dual Sim phone supports 4G LTE, 3G WCDMA, and 2G GSM. The phone comes in color options of Space Grey and Champagne Gold.   Did I miss something in this specs breakdown? Well, I did, I know. Actually, they missed mentioning the name of the processor used in today’s launch event. Somehow, I managed to find out that MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor clocked at 1.3GHz is used in OTTO Mark. Is this processor something to be ashamed about? How can they miss announcing the microprocessor name at the launch event? I’ll rather leave these questions unanswered.  Launch Event Review   I had been to the launch event myself so how could I not write few words about how the event was. The event started a little late but started with a bang. Since the event was a two-in-one i.e. Movie Promo and Phone Launch. At least, that is what I believe. It started with a dramatic entry of two actors from movie LOOT 2. If gathering some crowd was the primary objective of the launch event, they were successful in doing that. However, the event went out to be longer than expected and wasn’t that clean looking. I wish they managed to have a heightened stage.      OTTO brand in a smartphone is something I never heard before. I tried googling it after coming back to the office to find out more but couldn’t find a thing. No international official website, no mention in Wikipedia, just nothing other than a website which seemed still in construction:\xa0 Otto Phones’ Website  So if you think it’ll be a safe bet to trust an emerging brand then you can buy Otto Mark at a price of NRs. 19,996. Considering its specs on paper, it seems to be a good buy. But, how well it will perform in real-life is something we can say only after having our hands on it very soon.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_0444.jpg']

Although now that we’ve thousands of online services, multiple delivery companies and all that pay per service stuff, how are we actually paying for these services? PHYSICALLY! which is such a burden for the buyers or service seekers. But nonetheless, this mechanism has been working to some extent. It’s not like we don’t have online payment systems like eSewa and others but we don’t have a solid efficiency, diverse services, and security provided by the payment services like PayPal. Coming new to the scene of online payment is Khalti, which was recently showcased at CAN Info-Tech. And in a matter of few days, the app has been successful to gain more than 3000+ users which is already a pretty good milestone for a new service.  Khalti  on the first look, with all the material design and animation feels pleasing to the eyes. Using the app is also dead simple, you just have to Sign Up for the service, once you’re logged in you are provided with a Dashboard with a list of services supported by Khalti like: Mobile Topup, Landline Bill Payment, Dish Home Recharge, Sim TV Recharge, ADSL Bill Payment, Recharge Cards, Subisu and Worldlink Bill Payment. These\xa0are a whole lot of useful services but the option of online payment is still isn’t there and it is something we can hope to see in the future.         The good thing about recharging your phone with Khalti is that you’ll be rewarded with extra 2% cash back. Although you have the option to pay Worldlink Bill, it is supported for Volume based users only. With this app, you can also easily transfer the fund to other users which is a neat feature.  To get started with all the transactions, first you need to load your account with some fund and this is where the limitation of the app is reckoned. For now, you’re only allowed to load fund if you have an account on Nepal Investment Bank. The company is planning to partner with other major banks as well in the future. But if you already have an account on Nepal Investment Bank then online payment doesn’t get easier than this. This service is straight forward and you can get done with your payment within 2 to 3 clicks.

It’s the first time we’ve heard of the brand and during the show, we got a hands-on of few of their phones as well, which are really decent for the price. As of now, four Blackview products are showcased in the show, namely:  E7S, A8, BV6000S, BV5000 and A5.  Being a Chinese product, some of these products resemble other Chinese products which are not that bad. Some of the names sound pretty similar because we already have A8 and A5 on Samsung series of smartphones. But unlike the  Samsung phones , these are your basic but strange looking smartphones.  Blackview phones have been launched in Nepal via Pearl business Group Pvt. Ltd. They are also the authorized distributor of Diamond Mobiles.  Blackview A5:  Blackview A5   is the most affordable phone among the bunch. Design-wise, the phone looks pretty basic but the mosaic back cover is something you’ll have a love-hate relationship. A5 comes with a 4.5-inch 480p display. It is powered by MT6580 1.3Ghz processor and is coupled with 1GB of RAM. Storage wise it comes with\xa08GB of internal storage which can be expanded up to 32GB.

Today, the company has announced the 32GB variant of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4.  The price of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 was Rs. 32,999 earlier but now it’s Rs. 29,999 for 3GB RAM/64GB storage model. If you think the price is still steep, Vatsal Impex also recently introduced the 32GB variant of Redmi Note 4 which is available at  Rs. 26,999 . This new price is even cheaper than the previous price of Xiaomi Redmi note 3. To check the yesterday’s price drop of Redmi Note 3 and other Xiaomi devices, click  here .  After facing the continuous criticism for overpricing the Xiaomi devices and the import and sales of Xiaomi devices from the gray vendors, it seems like Vatsal Impex is now taking this business seriously. Luring the customers by slashing the device price is a good start. However, it seems like Vatsal Impex is only focusing on Redmi Note 4 as other devices are still overpriced despite the price cut.        Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 overview  Following the footsteps of its predecessor, Note 4 embraces the unibody metal design. The unibody metal outfit gives a premium feel to the users. The aluminum serving on the back is not as curved at the back, with the chamfered edges making for better ergonomics. \xa0The design also includes speaker grills on the bottom. There is a single speaker installed to the device, however, two grills are provided for the sake of symmetry. On the display side, the device carries a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD display with 2.5D curved glass. The 2.5D curved glass has made the device look seamless. Despite the launch of Snapdragon version, Vatsal Impex is providing Mediatek MT6797 Helio X20 version, which is a deca-core processor and runs on a clock speed of 2.1 GHz.   The device comes with the Android Marshmallow (v6.0.1) with MIUI 8.0 on the top. On the memory section, the phone has variants. However, Vatsal Impex is making the sale of only one variant which has 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of ROM. For the photography, phone houses a 13 MP front camera and 5 MP on the back. In this megapixel count, it is a downgrade from its predecessor, the Redmi Note 3. However, it outperforms the predecessor on the photography arena. The rear is facilitated with f/2.0 aperture, Phase detection autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. The rear one is also capable of shooting Full HD videos at 30 fps and HD videos at 120 fps frame rate. The front one, despite junior in the megapixel count, is furnished with the same size of the aperture (f/2.0) and is also capable of shooting HD videos.   Like the most of the Xiaomi smartphones, Note 4 also carries a fingerprint scanner, the circular slot existing right below the camera and the flash LEDs. For the cellular connections, the device features dual-SIM (Nano + Micro). However, you have to sacrifice the privilege of using dual-SIM if you wish to expand your device memory with the SD card. On the connectivity side, the device supports Wi-Fi \xa0802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, OTG, 4G connectivity, A-GPS and Bluetooth v4.2. The additional sensors joining the league with fingerprint sensor are an accelerometer, gyro, proximity, and compass.  On the weight of 175 grams and dimensions of 151 x 76 x 8.4 mm, the phone carries a 4100 mAh non-removable Li-Po battery. The travelers will always be benefitted. The device supports Quick Charge 2.0 for fast charging. However, the charging being limited to 5V/2A, the device takes around two hours for a full charge. The device also provides good battery backup, even for the heavy users, the battery last for a whole day. And for the light users, the battery backup seems like eternal.  Hit or Miss? Should I actually buy it?  As compared to the international price, the device is still overpriced. There are other smartphones, which may outperform Note 4 in the matter of camera. However, with the specs of the metallic body, excellent deca-core processor, Wi-Fi 802.11 ac compatibility, OTG compatibility, Gyro sensor and whopping battery of 4100 mAh, there is no comparison to Note 4 in this price range. So, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 could be a good buy.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/redmi-note-4-nepal.jpg']

['Researchers say heartbeat can be used to unlock data'],['Security'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['January 25, 2017']",2017-01-25 06:01:51+00:00,"['A patient’s own heartbeat could be used to secure their personal data, according to researchers at Binghamton State University, New York. This report comes after the claims that around 27 million health reports were undermined in 2016.  Read More:  Hackers can replicate fingerprints from photos with peace sign  So how does this work? According to the researchers, a person has their own unique heartbeat and electrical activities associated with it. The electrical activity that occurs in a heart can be measured by an electrocardiograph. Basically, by measuring the electrical activity, the data that is obtained could be used to encrypt and secure an individual’s health records.        The electrocardiograph is used to collect heart signals during routine examinations of any disease. And since the system will already have the data, it can simply use it again to decrypt the health record. This simply reduces cost and time.  Zhanpeng Jin, assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Binghamton University, said, “There have been so many mature encryption techniques available, but the problem is that those encryption techniques rely on some complicated arithmetic calculations and random key generations.”  However, it will be a long time before we see this technique being applied to unlock smartphones or other devices. Jin added, “If you apply those kinds of encryptions on top of the mobile device, then you can burn the battery very quickly.”  But why hasn’t this form of encryption technique been adopted everywhere? Well, simply because it has some drawbacks. The electrical activity of your heart changes depending on physical activity, mental condition, age, and other health-associated problems, thus making the technique more vulnerable and sensitive. But researchers are working on the ways this problem can be solved.  Jin also mentioned that ECG cannot be used as a biometric authenticator alone, but it can be used as a secondary authentication.  Currently, encryption and cryptography are used to secure health records. But these methods are time-consuming, expensive and computing intense.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unlock-data-by-heart-beat.png']

['InFocus Epic 1 launched in Nepal : Phone with deca-core processor'],['infocus'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 24, 2017']",2017-01-24 06:54:57+00:00,"['Prism Technology Pvt. Ltd., the authorized distributor of InFocus Smartphones for Nepal, has launched InFocus Epic 1 in Nepal. The phone priced at NRs. 31,999 has a lot to offer including a deca-core processor. In this post, we’ll be breaking down all the specs of the Infocus Epic 1. Here’s everything you need to know about the first phone in the family of Epic series from the Infocus.  Before talking about anything else, let’s dive right into the biggest highlight of this phone. And, that’s the MediaTek Helio X-20 deca-core processor.  What makes Helio X-20 different than the rest?      Helio X.20 Deca-Core Processor with Tri-Cluster   1  of 4                                                          First thing’s first. It is the first deca-core processor for smartphones. Not just the 10 counts of the CPU cores, but the real deal breaker is its Tri-Cluster CPU architecture. This Tri-Cluster is designed as Dual-A72 @2.0GHz + Quad-A53 @1.9GHz + Quad-A53 @1.4GHz. This cluster configuration can be explained using the gears we use in vehicles. More the gears, greater the fuel efficiency in the vehicle. The same way, this tri-cluster configuration makes Helio X-20 be a more powerful and more power efficient than the dual-cluster one. Less powerful tasks like sending a text will use the power-efficient clusters. Similarly, what triggers the powerful clusters is the power-hungry tasks like gaming and others. That way, Helio X-20 claims to have high performance and less consumption.        Everything you need to know about “InFocus Epic 1”   Coming back to what InFocus Epic 1 comes equipped with, the 5.5-inch screen soldier has the full HD LTPS display protected with a Corning Gorilla Glass. InFocus, claims the display to be a promising one as it works on Content Upscaling algorithm. This technology helps in getting good viewing experience even while watching low-resolution contents. Coming to the design, it is a unibody phone with brushed metal, curved back, and rounded edges. The rounded earpiece on the top is certainly going to work as a head-turner.  Under the hood, the Epic 1 is powered by Helio X-20 deca-core processor, Mali T880 MP4 GPU and the LPDDR3 RAM of 3GB. The inbuilt storage is of 32GB that is expandable up to\xa0128GB. You’ll find the loudspeaker, USB C port, and mic at the bottom. The phone has managed to accommodate 3.5mm jack on the top. The right edge of the device sports the power button and volume rockers. Moreover, You’ll find the fingerprint sensor on the back.  The camera units seem to be a competitive one with 16MP, PDAF, AIS with Dual tone flash at the Back and 8 MP, f1.8 selfie unit on the front with 82 °\xa0 wide angle. The primary camera can shoot 4k videos as well. 3000mAh battery is fueling the device. The phone boots on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with In Life UI 2.0 layered on top.  To conclude, the Infocus Epic 1 looks quite of a deal on a paper, but how well it performs in real life is something we can say only after having our hands on it. For those looking forward to buying this phone, they can do so hopefully in the first week of February as that’s when the device is expected to hit the Nepali market.  Key highlights of the InFocus Epic 1:   5.5-inch IPS LCD Display, 1920*1080 pixels,  Android\xa06.0 Marshmallow with In Life UI layered on Top  Helio X.20 Deca-core processor with Mali T880 MP4 GPU  3GB RAM  32 GB internal Storage; up to 128 GB via microSD  16MP rear camera w/ dual tone LED flash, PDAF, AIS (can shoot videos up to 4k)  8MP\xa0front camera with f 1.8, 82 °\xa0 wide angle  3000 mAH battery  Dual Sim (Hybrid tray, both nano)  Price of InFocus Epic 1 in Nepal: Rs.\xa031,999']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/infocus-epic-1-press-image.png']

['Samsung Officially Explains Why Note 7 Exploded'],['Samsung'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 23, 2017']",2017-01-23 07:30:57+00:00,"[""Samsung , the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer,\xa0experienced 2016 as a nightmare to the company. It was not because\xa0they didn’t make enough profits. It was because the  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 , one of two major flagships from the company, was recalled not once but twice, leading to ultimate killing off the troubled device. This recalling made Samsung bear the loss of approximately 3 billion US dollars. Actually, the loss was more than this monetary value. The company became the point of mistrust to the customers and potential customers worldwide. The long-awaited official response from Samsung on what made the Note 7 cause fire has come out. Samsung did the live streaming of the press event on YouTube. So, Why Note 7 Exploded? Here’s what you need to know about what made Note 7 exhale smoke.  The mystery behind the Note 7 catching fire:   In short, it was all because of the battery. No hardware, software or design issues of the device contributed to its failure. Rather, the fault was in the battery, actually both the batteries. In first recall, Samsung said it was the battery and replaced it. The replaced batteries were no safer as well. These two batteries were from different manufacturers and both had issues but completely different. However, the result was the same. The malfunctioning in the battery caused the battery to short circuit and rose overheating issue that eventually fried the device.        Out of two flaws, the first flaw was in the first battery that came with the first release of the phone. Samsung titled it as Battery A. This  Battery A had design issues  from the manufacturers. In simple words,  the casing of Battery A was too small to safely fit the electrode assembly inside, which led to short circuiting .      Samsung's Findings on Note 7's Battery Failure   1  of 5                                                                    Coming to the battery failure of the replaced batteries, the Battery B. Some of these batteries didn’t have issues priorly because they were manufactured with good quality assurance. To address higher demands, manufacturer seemed to underlook the quality check and focused on numbers. It led to different manufacturing errors in the battery which could have been avoided with a good quality assurance. Battery B had issues in its electrode tab ultrasonic welding which had some perturbation resulting in insulation failure and short circuiting. Plus, many battery units failed to include proper insulation between the electrodes.  More on How Samsung carried the Note 7 investigation:   In this 120 days long investigation, Samsung did a lot. It built a dedicated test lab for this investigation. It packed the lab with 700 researchers, 200,000 devices, and 30,000 batteries. Hundreds and thousands of test were carried in different conditions to replicate the real-life explosion of the phone. It tested the whole device including wired, wireless, normal and fast charging in different conditions. It checked the device with and without water-resistance as well.  Samsung performed numerous tests on other features as well like USB-C charger and Iris Scanner.\xa0It evaluated the software and algorithms tied to wireless charging. It even cross-checked how third party applications were impacting the phone. Over and above that, Samsung worked with three\xa0third party test labs – UL, Exponent, and TUVRheinland. These labs investigated over issues\xa0across software, hardware, manufacturing, logistics and handling. However, they come with the findings same as the Samsung blaming the battery for the explosion.  Will the next Samsung device catch fire?  Well, Note 7 proved to be more of a lesson and less of a phone. Samsung has got a worthy of experience from what happened last year. Now, the Samsung claims to be committed to quality more than ever. Specifically, next time if a Samsung device catches a fire it won’t be because of a battery. That’s because the company has created a dedicated battery advisory group.   Along with that, Samsung said to enact a number of changes to its internal processes to avoid making the same mistake down the road. The company will assign teams to own the crucial final checks for each device’s core components, and putting batteries through an 8-point test with steps ranging from visual inspection to x-ray inspection to full disassembly.""]",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2_Large-scale-test-facility_device_2-1200x800.jpg']

['Worst Passwords of 2016 [ including tips for strong passwords ]'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 22, 2017']",2017-01-22 10:52:44+00:00,"['In this digital world, the password is the new hello. It is in the sense that we got to use passwords everywhere. Passwords are the means of securing our data and information. Passwords are something we use in our mobiles and routers to make them secure. But how strong or stupid our current passwords are, let’s find out Worst Passwords.  Worst Passwords of 2016  Before moving to the strength of one’s password, I’d like to share few of the worst passwords of 2016. They are called worst because they are the easiest one to crack and are being used the most. The worst passwords of this year aren’t much different than those of previous years. Yes, few passwords got up the list and few got down in the list. Let’s not go into actually ranking of such passwords. It’ll be easier to address them without ordering. No matter if it happens to be a No. 1 or No. 25 in the ranking, it is still the worst password and you should never use it.  Here is the list of worst Passwords of 2016:         123456  password  qwerty  abc123  1234567890  9876543210  qwertyuiop  1qaz2wsx  welcome  monkey  football  baseball  letmein  login  princess  master  123123  111111  passw0rd  starwars   Well, there are still many to this list. By now, you must have got an overview. So don’t use generic words and numbers as your password. Plus, the sequential ordering of numbers and letters is the worst password one can come up with.  Tips for generating strong passwords?   Yes, there are few website and apps that claim to generate strongest of a password for you. But I recommend you not to use one. Not because they are not safe or secure. But passwords generated that way will be something hard for you to remember. So, the best would be generating the password on your own. By keeping few things in mind one can come up with a strong password possible.   It’s always better to use longer passwords.  It’s never recommended to use a phrase as a password by omitting spaces. E.g. Do not use something like “SheIsMine”  It’s wiser to use unrelated words while keeping them in the password. E.g. Do not use related groups of words like “WaterDrinksIce” rather prefer something like “BirdsBikeDesertHoliday”  Use UpperCases, LowerCases, Special Characters, Numbers but not in a generic way like it’s not wiser to use two or three consecutive numbers at the end. Rather, put them somewhere in the middle and not in a consecutive way. E.g. “LetsGoShopping99” isn’t as strong as “Let$7G0$hopping9”  Do not use same passwords on different platforms. I repeat, do not use same passwords for different websites. If someone cracks your password for one site, all your digital world will be at stake.   This isn’t a hard and fast rule you must follow. It is something in my opinion and experience that I find handy to generate a stronger password. Lastly, you can check how strong your password is, by testing in the websites like  PasswordMeter . That said, no password is 100% strong and secure.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/worst-password-2016.png']
['Hackers can replicate fingerprints from photos with peace sign'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 22, 2017']",2017-01-22 09:44:59+00:00,"['With the advancement of technology, security features in everything have got more reliable and secure. At least, that is what we believe. After the use of fingerprints, we believe ID theft will be something we’ll be hearing the least. Since everyone’s fingerprint is a unique one. That’s why people prefer fingerprints to pin codes and passwords. Even in movies, people clone fingerprints from a physical surface. Abstracting fingerprint data from a digital source wasn’t considered as an option. But, one\xa0recent Japanese research claims replicating one’s fingerprint needs nothing but a digital Photograph.  Photographs have become a new cool these days. Every day, there’s a flood of photographs in social medias. But the next time you click a photo, it is rather wiser to not flash your fingers in it. Posing for a picture while holding your hands up in\xa0a peace sign could pose a security threat, with hackers able to\xa0recreate prints that are the key to\xa0phones, computers, and tablets.  Researchers at Japan’s National Institute of Informatics (NII) have successfully regenerated one’s fingerprint with the help of a photograph taken from up to 3 meters away. Well, not all the photographs will give the best results. The conditions for successful cloning of fingerprint were, the photograph needs to be a high res one and it has to be taken in a well-lit environment.         It’s not the first time that one’s fingerprint data has been abstracted from a photo. More than 2 years ago, a group of hackers did the same thing. They claimed to have recreated German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen’s fingerprint by using a picture of her thumb taken at a press conference.  Remedy to not let others replicate your fingerprint from a photo:   Coming to the remedies, they might sound funny but they are the fact.\xa0Many high profile people, at a risk of biometric ID being stolen, wear gloves. It is wiser to not pose the two-finger peace sign while taking photos today onwards. Plus, these Japanese researchers told about a remedy as well. That is a biometric jammer. It is a transparent film containing titanium oxide that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. However, such attachment of film won’t stop your fingerprint from working.\xa0Unfortunately, this biometric jammer won’t be available commercially for at least two more years.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hackers.png']

During the recent years, the number of Otakus is increasing in Nepal as the increase of people’s interest for anime, manga and video games. Various conventions and events have been successfully organized for the purpose of promoting the anime, manga and gaming sectors. \xa0So for the same purpose, the year 2017 kick started with one of the biggest Otaku events held in Nepal- Otaku Jatra. Otaku Jatra was held with the slogan “By the fans, for the fans” on 14 th  January at Celebration Heights, Sukedhara, Kathmandu in which cosplay competition, gaming contest, and anime merchandises were the main attraction.   The event was organized by Otaku Club Nepal with the management of Lil Bit Entertainments that gathered a huge crowd of more than 2000 people. The event had 14 stalls which included anime stores selling anime merchandises, welfare organizations (Sneha’s Care, Helpibri), event partners and sponsors. One of the stalls also had quiz anime hosted by Nepanime. The event had 6 food stalls with various mouthwatering Japanese Dishes and the chefs were very busy due to the random orders of the customers. The Maid Café also attracted many visitors where cute girls dressed up as Japanese maids were serving foods. The face Painting stalls were also one of the attractions for visitors.         \xa0  Now moving on to the cosplay section, almost 160 cosplayers were registered for the events competition as well as many unregistered cosplayers were also seen. Cosplayers who weren’t able to register for the event was also given chance to perform on the stage. People witnessed cosplay’s from various famous animes and movies such as Naruto, Goku, Wolverine, Joker, kakashi etc. and also the couple from Makoto Shinkai’s famous movie Kimi no Na Wa(Your Name). The competition winner were cosplays of Ryuk and Misa(Death Note), Mystogan(Fairy Tail) and Rem & Ram(Re: Zero) being 1 st , 2 nd , nd 3 rd  respectively. Devil Jin (Tekken) and Mayuri\xa0Kurotsuchi (Bleach) were honorable cosplayers and Arju Takayamaji being youngest cosplayers cosplaying Goku from Dragon Ball.  Rohit Shrestha, Winner of Cosplay Competition said, “ Being passionate about cosplay comes first to me rather than winning- Winning just proved that you are on right track. My cosplay wouldn’t have been successful without the prop designer Wataru Ram Shrestha and Sakun who helped me a lot and it wouldn’t have been successful without my other half Puza Tamang who is other half of my cosplay Misa. The feeling of winning something is great. When my name was announced I couldn’t believe but all the hard work paid off” .  As Rohit was also one of the organizers he was busy preparing for the event for the event the day before and was working for the cosplay during the night, his hard works really paid him off. Most of them loved his cosplay especially Ryuk’s mask.        1  of 5                                                                    The event also had performances from The Bang Up crew, Mongolian Namja, Otaku Bboys, K-Hoppers, H2B, Crimson Yeoja, Rapper DMJ, and action packed Wushu performance. Dhiraj Magar, Youtuber (thatdudevlogs), also came to the event and spoke a few words appreciating the participants and the event itself. The event also had a head banging performance. And the AMV’s by Silent Pages were awesome.  Wataru Shrestha, Founder of Otaku Club Nepal said, “ Overall the event was a huge success although there were difficulties here and there. All of our team worked super hard but most of them couldn’t see the performances because they were busy managing here and there but we are very happy, we didn’t expect much of a crowd, though. Well, we would like to continue spreading Otaku culture in Nepal” .  Even though the venue was large, it was crowded. The organizers hadn’t even expected such huge crowd. Maybe there was huge crowd because of their hard works from designs to photos shoot to video promos all of their hard works paid off. The event was a huge success because it was very interactive in each and every aspect as well as promoted the Nepali otaku culture in the best way possible. People who didn’t attend the event really missed something great. In case you missed it don’t worry there is another two-day event “NEPAL COMIC AND COSPLAY CONVENTION” hosted by Otaku Next during the month of March 2017.

['Researchers reveal smartphone batteries with built-in fire extinguisher'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['January 21, 2017']",2017-01-21 10:20:41+00:00,"['Last year, Samsung Galaxy Note 7 made headlines for all the wrong reasons. The device’s battery was on fire – literally. While Samsung hasn’t released its investigation report on why the battery exploded, it is believed to have happened due to the battery’s size and manufacturing issues.  Samsung used lithium-Ion battery for the Galaxy Note 7. And one of the major problems with li-ion battery is that it tends to explode if heated. We have seen many devices catch fire due to this problem.  Read More:  Samsung knows why the Galaxy Note 7 exploded        Read More:  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fire fiasco  A Li-Ion battery consists of two types of electrodes, a positive one, and a negative one. The charged particles from one electrode are sent to another electrode via an electrolyte. And issues like short-circuiting or overcharging can create heat that can go up to 150°C. This results in electrolyte catching fire that in turn creates an explosion.  So, to solve this issue, researchers from Stanford University, USA, have designed lithium-ion batteries that feature a built-in fire extinguisher to prevent the battery from catching fire. They simply added a compound called triphenyl phosphate (TPP), a component used as a flame retardant in different electronic devices.  So what exactly can TPP do in a lithium-ion battery? When the electrolyte’s temperature reaches 150°C, a plastic fiber separating the electrolyte and TPP melts, releasing the chemical that in turn puts out the flame that has generated.  Since the chemical has a capacity to affect any device’s performance when it comes in contact with the electrolyte, the researcher used the plastic fiber separator.  Yi Cui, the project’s lead scientist, said, “Using our ‘smart’ separators, battery electrochemical performance will not be affected by the flame retardant under normal conditions. However, once there is a potential thermal runaway, the flame retardant will be activated and nip the fire or explosion in the bud.”  The researchers have claimed that the fire retardant can stop the electrolyte from burning up in just 0.4 seconds.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-explosion-2.jpg']

The impatient android users don’t wait for official updates and rather flash different Custom ROMS build on the latest version of Android. Such flashing doesn’t ensure the performance improvements, so it is rather wise to wait for the official update to enroll.  Samsung has started enrolling Android 7.0 Nougat Update to its unlocked devices. The first Samsung devices to get this update are undoubtedly from the S7 series.

There are going to be 3 versions of this phone:   2GB RAM & 32GB storage ($149)  3GB RAM & 32GB storage ($161)  4GB RAM & 64GB storage ($190)   If you want a budget phone with heavy duty specs, this phone should be on your radar. The new note 4 features a uni-body aluminum design with 2.5D curved glass. It has a 5.5-inch 1080p IPS LCD screen and a fingerprint sensor at the back.\xa0But the main attraction is the new snapdragon 625. This might seem odd as the older note 3 had a faster snapdragon 650 but the newer 625 is built on a smaller 14nm architecture compared to the previous 28nm architecture. This means there won’t be a significant downgrade in performance but will have a huge improvement in battery life. Xiaomi claims a 25% increase in battery life over the note 3, and with a slightly larger 4100mAH battery it’s bound to provide better battery life. The disappointing part is there is still no fast charging.  It has a 13 megapixel back camera with auto-focus, phase detection and 1080p video recording and 5-megapixel front camera. It also has dual SIM support and currently runs on MIUI 8 with Android Marshmallow and will soon be upgraded to Nougat.   This phone isn’t\xa0much of an\xa0improvement over the old note 3 in terms of performance. The newer note 4, however, offers more RAM & storage options with improved battery life. But the improved battery life comes at the sacrifice of performance. It also has a weaker WiFi version and has a lower megapixel count (which doesn’t necessarily mean a bad thing) and it still doesn’t have a proper screen protection. if you already own a note 3 then you are better off with that but if you are not then the new note 4 will not disappoint you for the money you will be paying.   The bigger question is if you should go for the snapdragon version or the MediaTek version. The MediaTek version  was launched in Nepal  for Rs 33,000 which is a lot to ask for. But if that isn’t a problem for you then I personally suggest getting the snapdragon version because of the smaller\xa0architecture which provides better battery life and because it’s a smaller processor will also run comparatively cooler. I still think even with the huge price tag in Nepal, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is still a good buy for the performance it provides.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Redmi-Note-4.jpg']

The former smartphone giant has now become a threat to other manufacturers as the Nokia’s Android-powered device Nokia 6 sold out within a minute on its launched date.  A few days back, Nokia 6 was unveiled in the smartphone market ushered by HMD Global. However, the manufacturers had mentioned the sales of Nokia 6 to be confined only to China. Though the sale confined only in China, Nokia 6 sold out within a minute adding its name to the list of rapid-sold-out devices.  Nokia or HMD Global has not yet flashed the actual numerical figure of the sold out devices. However, the device was said to receive over a million of registrations for the first flash sale. The sale was out of the expectation, which showed that the popularity of Nokia is still intact. So, in the second flash sale, a higher number is expected to be brought. The date for the second flash sale has not been disclosed yet. However, it can be expected to happen very soon.        In the specs, Nokia 6 features 5.5 FHD  IPS LCD display  with the 403 PPI pixel density and Corning Glass 3 protection.

It’s one of the most affordable smartphones you can buy in the Nepali market.  The Colors Pride P32 sports a 4.5-inch (854×480 pixels) FWVGA TFT LCD display. It is powered by a fairly decent quad-core processor (MT6580M, 4 cores, Cortex A7, 1.3Ghz) and 1GB of RAM. With this configuration, you can expect decent multitasking and even light to mid end gaming. In terms of storage, the phone comes with 8GB of onboard memory, but you can expand it via microSD card upto 32GB. What’s even great is it runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow which means you can make your microSD card work as your internal storage. Fueling the Pride P32 is 1800mAh removable battery which we expect to provide a backup for a full 24 hours on medium usage. Camera-wise, there’s a 5MP primary back shooter with LED flash and a VGA selfie cam.        1  of 2                                      The Pride P32 is targetted for the first time smartphone buyers or for someone on a tight budget.

However, our wallet does not always support our interests. Buying a budget-friendly smartphone could be the alternative but they soon get obsolete as the OS version is always upgrading. Owing to those difficulties, Google’s Android One is coming as a messiah to the low-budgeted consumers.  Back in 2014, Google launched android One platform with a view to providing wallet-friendly smartphones to the developing markets. Back then, Google shook hands with the minor companies like Micromax, Spice, and Karbonn. The journey seemed fruitful as Spice Android One Dream UNO MI-498, Micromax Canvas A1, and Karbonn Sparkle V emerged in the market. Each of the devices featured 4.5” 854×480 pixel displays packed with 1GB RAM and 4GB ROM. Cemented with 1.3 GHz MediaTek quad-core processors, the devices had 5MP+2MP cameras and 1700 mAh battery.  Google’s Android One pioneer devices were available under $100 back then. However, the second lot of Google’s Android One will supposedly cost price in the range of $200-$300. So, the new devices are certainly carrying superior specs than the previous ones. However, one thing about the devices has been confirmed. The smartphones will come with a guarantee of being updated with the latest Android updates and security for two years after the phone is purchased.        Though Google is funding the campaign, Google is not going to make them by itself. According to the clue from our news sources, the manufacturing works would be handled by LG. Since the inclusion of Amazon’s Alexa assistant instead of Google’s to the Huawei Mate 9 created tension between the two.  The new Google’s Android One devices are likely to make its way in the US in the mid of this year. Since the consumers in the US are inclined on having flagship built phones and they are already many budget-friendly devices packed with greater specs, we can expect that the device could emerge in the Nepali markets too. Another reason that could support this statement could be the new Google strategies. The new Google strategy hints that in spite of struggling in the established markets, Google wants to own the emerging markets of the developing countries. The device has not yet been launched and no further information have come from the Google. Time will reveal everything so all we have to do now is wait.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/android-one.jpg']

['The Light Phone: A phone to cure your phone addiction'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 17, 2017']",2017-01-17 12:26:42+00:00,"['Since smartphones happened, a lot has changed. After the advancement of technology, the human life has become easier and complex at the same time. We can do a day-long debate on whether the use of smartphones has made our life better or worse. Well, I’ve to admit I use my phone more than I have to. Actually, many of us do the same. We use our phone literally all the time. Many of us, start our day with the phone and end it with the same. Now, Smartphone addiction has become a real thing. At the time everyone’s seeking for a cure, a phone named The Light Phone claims to help us cure our phone addiction. Can a phone cure a phone addiction? Let’s find out.  What is The Light Phone?  It all started as a  Kickstarter campaign  that managed to get enough of backers and raised $415,127. That’s already more than the amount they pledged for, which happened to be $200,000. This startup was initiated by two guys namely, Joe Hollier and Kai Tang. Joe is an artist and Tang has good work experience on product designing and development.         The light phone is “your phone away from phone”. At least, that’s what their  facebook page  says. Coming to what this credit-card sized phone offers, it can do two things and two things only. It can make a call and answer a call. That’s it. Sounds minimalistic, right? Well, that’s what this phone is for. The makers say this phone is designed to be used as little as possible. So, this is certainly not a phone for everyone. Looking at its Kickstarter community and facebook page visitors, there are people who are eagerly waiting for this phone to ship.   This credit-sized phone comes in the color of Matte white and might come in black as well. This might be one of the lightest phones as it weighs only 38.5 gms. The phone sports dot-matrix display along with touchable 10 digits of a keypad. There’s an earpiece at the top and below is where the time and Caller ID will be displayed. It is powered by MediaTek 6250. Its battery life will be 20 days in standby. The phone accepts mini SIM Card that has to be from a carrier working on GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz. Users can set up to 10-speed dial numbers. However, \xa0English is the only language available in the interface. Plus, it has a microUSB port at the bottom for charging by the side of the microphone.  Verdict  If you’re making a mindset of getting one, let me tell you a fact that might make you re-think. It is nothing but the price. The Light phone costs you $150 + shipping and customs charges. Well, I would never buy a phone that is so overpriced and has so little to offer. If the best way of curing a phone addiction is by using a phone that delivers the tech of the 1990s, I would rather try using a bar phone. This phone is for those hobbyists who love trying new things regardless of how practical they are.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/the-light-phone.jpg']

This fantasy will no longer be confined to your to your imagination as Airbus is planning to develop flying car prototype at the end of this year.  Traffic jams making us late to the work is not a new problem. The gridlock because of the myriads of vehicles in the road is also inviting an environmental (sound and air) pollution. Moreover, the investment for making roads and bridges is devouring the budget of the nation and hindering other developments. Keeping all the problems in mind, Airbus is going to develop a flying car as the solution to all those problems.  “One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground, now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders unveiled his enthusiasm to the DLD digital tech conference in Munich.  For the sake of shaping the self-piloted flying car plan into reality, Airbus formed a division called Urban Air Mobility\xa0last year. The division primarily focuses on discovering concepts about the transportation through the air media. The Airbus has conceived the vehicle to be helicopter-styled capable of carrying multiple riders.        Hoping to be the pioneer in the flying vehicle business, Jorg Muller, from Airbus’ corporate development department said, “This market will develop quickly once we are able to deploy the first vehicles in megacities and demonstrate the benefits of quiet, emission-free air transport at competitive prices.”  CEO Enders implied that Airbus, being the world’s largest commercial helicopter maker would always be focused on inviting technology to its traction system. Enders also showed his interests to invite autonomous driving and artificial intelligence in order to usher the humankind to the epoch of flying cars. According to the Enders, the “sky taxi” would be 100 percent electric and he further implied to bring the vehicle until 2021 if the prototype gets ready at the end of this year.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Airbus.png']

The headset is light as it is made from lycra. It fits smartphones of screen sizes from 4 inches to 5.7 inches. The phones are placed and locked\xa0by a two-way zipper which works fine and does the job. Inside the headset, two anti-reflective aspheric lenses are placed. There is an adjustable strap to lock the device onto our eyes and one physical button. The headset is comfortable to wear and spacious enough to fit glasses also. It is definitely not the most comfortable one but at this price the design is justifiable. The physical button is placed above the VR set and it presses the phone’s touchscreen to act as a controller to the VR. There are no other control buttons.         But this control button is a working wonder in the case of this headset. We tested the VR with Samsung Galaxy Note 5. While using the VR dedicated apps and videos, a small pointer appears on the screen which can be targeted to the desired option or button that you want to select by adjusting the orientation of one’s head and pressing the button in the VR. It may sound little confusing in words but using that feature is a piece of cake in real life scenario.   The headset is comfortable to wear and spacious enough to fit glasses also. There is also a dedicated VR app designed by MI \xa0that includes a selection of 360-degree videos from YouKu (China’s equivalent of YouTube) and others. One can download the app from the QR code one gets from the user guide that comes with the VR. The app is completely in the Chinese language so we tested the VR with 360-degree youtube videos and google cardboard apps. The VR offers nothing special but\xa0overall experience was nice. But the VR offers only 75 degree of viewing angle which is less compared to other mid range VR.   The VR very simple in design and use. So one can not expect too much from it. Overall the experience in Cardboard apps and the 360-degree youtube video is\xa0still comparable to Google Cardboard. It doesn’t have the built-in sensor which we find in the higher end headset like Samsung Galaxy Gear VR but for the price justifies the experience one gets through the VR. The virtual reality enthusiast may not find this device special but for any first time user who wants to experience virtual reality, the product is recommended.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Xiaomi-VR-6-scaled.jpg']

They didn’t find a right spot since they were neither phones nor tablets. They didn’t solve the real problem. The users want something with a big screen just like a tablet. At the same time, they want it to have portability of a phone maintaining smaller dimensions. Well, that was so unrealistic until Samsung registered a patent for a folding phone.

Well, they were so cool until smartphones happened. I used to rock one and what I liked the most about it is the secondary screen it used to have. I didn’t have to flip open the phone to check time and notifications. If you are thinking why I’m talking about those phones then it is because the patent Samsung registered for a folding phone was just like the flip phones. One with a screen hidden under, and a hinge that helps in folding and unfolding of the device. But definitely, it has differences. It is going to be far more advanced than the flip phones.\xa0That’s for sure. The bigger problem for any manufacturer to come up with such phone is the screen itself needs to be bendable.

Nintendo makes sure that games run smooth and you have fun. All we know is it’s based on the Maxwell architecture by Nvidia, has 4GB of RAM and 32GB internal with a micro SD card support.  For around $300 you get a 6.2 inch 720p display which can run on battery and you can then connect to the Nintendo switch dock which then connects to your TV through an HDMI cable.\xa0It supports up to a 1080p output.         And yet the Nintendo switch’s main attraction is its Joy-Con controllers. These are two detachable controllers which has NFC, vibration motor, IR sensor, gyroscope, motion detectors etc. which helps detect things like your precise hand movements, which means it knows if you threw a straight punch or a curve punch. The joy-con controllers also feature “HD rumble”, which is a force feedback feature that Nintendo says can give you the feeling of holding a glass filled with ice and shaking cubes inside or the glass being filled with water.  Photo credits: bgr.in  These controllers can be used either side by side with the Nintendo switch or with the joy-con grip or use them separately or with the joy-con straps like on the Wii U.  The games it’s releasing with are the Legend of Zelda, ARMS (which takes advantage of the motion detectors), Switch, MARIOKART 8 deluxe (obviously), Splatoon 2 and also famous game titles like FIFA, Skyrim V, Minecraft, NBA2K18, street fighter, and Just Dance. You can buy games from the Nintendo eShop.  There are accessories that can also be purchased separately like the Nintendo switch pro controller, joy-con charging grip, Nintendo switch dock set, and joy-con wheel.   Nintendo Switch will be releasing this march which is a great home console with portable capabilities which Nintendo says can last 2-6 hours on a single charge.

"['Everything about SSD: Types, Buying Guide, Optimization, Pros and Cons']","['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 13, 2017']",2017-01-13 09:42:21+00:00,"['You might have heard a lot about SSDs and how they will help you speed up your computer’s performance. SSDs are without any doubt the best upgrade your computer can get. However, the technology of SSD is constantly changing. So, before you rush to the market and get an SSD for yourself, you should ask yourself these questions first.   Do I really need an SSD?  What types of SSDs are there in the market?  Which SSD type is good for my money?  Does my existing system support SSD?   Well, if you were stuck on any of these questions, this post is for you! I will try my best to answer all the above questions. So, let’s start!  What is a Solid-State Drive (SSD)?  According to Wikipedia, a  solid-state drive  ( SSD , also known as a  solid-state disk ) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently.        In simple terms, SSD is a data storage device for a computer, like your regular hard disk drive (HDD) in terms of functionality. However, unlike Hard disk which stores data mechanically (with moving parts), SSD uses digital signals to store data.  In a traditional HDD, data is stored on the spinning metal platters that has a magnetic coating. So, whenever a user accesses data on HDD, a little needle-like component called head moves to the exact location of the spinning platters to provide the data. Also, writing on HDD also happens in a similar pattern with platters spinning continuously.  On the other hand, SSDs store data on interconnected flash memory chips ( called blocks). When you want to access a certain data, the SSD will directly point you to the exact block. Additionally, SSDs are non-volatile which means you can retain data when power is lost. This enables applications to access data faster.  Besides HDD and SDD, there are SSHD (Solid-state Hybrid Drive) drives available in the market. They are basically HDD with an SDD cache to improve the performance of a system. SSD cache in an SSHD stores boot files so that your computer can boot faster. The SSD cache will store frequently accessed data.  Pros and Cons of SSD  The obvious reason for choosing an SSD over an HDD is its I/O speed. But, there are also other things to consider while choosing a storage device. Let’s look at some advantages and disadvantages of SSD.  Pros:   Speed  Durability (no moving parts so doesn’t get damaged easily)  Size (can be very small)  Noise (no noise)  No Fragmentation issues   Cons:   Price (expensive in terms of dollar per gigabyte)  Longevity (SSD wears out after certain write cycle)   Should you get an SSD?  If you can afford it (SSDs are becoming cheaper these days), YES! If you are low on a budget consider the following things.  You are good with HDD if you:   Are heavy multimedia users and heavy downloaders. You like collecting movies and videos.  Want to build a system on a budget. You will get plenty of cheap storage space with HDD.  Do graphics designing or engineering. You need to store a lot of projects files and need to be constantly writing and reading from your storage. And, since SSDs wear out, it will be cheaper to use HDD.   You need SSD if you:   Don’t mind spending money for a good performance.  Always need to carry your computer with you and are always in a rush. SSD provides better durability (in case you drop your laptop) and security. Also, SSD is non-volatile so you can get back immediately to where you were before on your computer.  Do graphics designing or engineering. I know, I know, I said you need an HDD like a minute ago. However, the efficiency of your work increases significantly if you use SSD. SSD will increase the performance of your system. That’s why you need a dual-drive system (we will talk about it later).  Are an audio engineer and a musician. The noise of HDD can degrade your music quality.   Gadgetbyte’s Recommendation:   Get a dual-drive system. In this setup, you install a small SSD for the Operating System and the applications and a large HDD for storing data. This way, you can not only enjoy the benefit of the speed of SSD but also enjoy the extra storage of HDD at a relatively low cost. You can buy laptops with this feature. And, if you are setting up your desktop, buy the right kind of motherboard that supports a dual-drive system.  Now that you are clear about whether you want an SSD or not, let’s move to types of SSDs.  Types of SSDs  Depending on the type of logical circuit used,\xa0 there are mainly two types of flash storage: NOR and NAND. NOR is used in mobile technologies whereas NAND is used for making storage devices. This means most of the SSDs that are available for consumers use NAND flash. Furthermore, there are four types of NAND flash–  SLC, MLC,  eMLC, and TLC.  Am I scaring you off with these technical acronyms? Bear with me because I won’t be going into the detail about the NAND types. However, I will explain you about types of SSDs based on form factors and the interface it uses for communication.  SSDs with SATA Interface   These are the most commonly found and most affordable types of SSDs. Currently, there are four types of SATA interface available in the market. The speeds are rated in Gbps (not to be confused with GBPS)  SATA  I :\xa0 It is the first generation SATA interface. It has a speed of 1.5 Gb/s. The bandwidth (actual read and write speed), which is supported by the interface, is up to 187.5MB/s.  SATA II:  It is the second generation SATA interface running at 3.0 Gb/s. The bandwidth throughput, which is supported by the interface, is up to 375MB/s.  SATA III:\xa0 It is the third-generation SATA interface with the speed of 6.0Gb/s. The bandwidth throughput, which is supported by the interface, is up to 750MB/s.  SATA Express:  This is a special SATA interface designed for PCs. It supports both SATA and PCIe. The rated speed of SATA Express is 10Gbps.  Regardless of the interface used, SSDS can be classified into different types based on the form factor (the size and connector type). They are:   2.5″\xa0     It usually comes in 2.5-inch size with a capacity of up to 1TB. But, the capacity barrier is regularly increasing. The drive is enclosed in a shell. This type of SSD uses SATA connectors for power and data transfer which makes it the most compatible SSD in the market. SATA SSDs are mostly found in Desktops, Laptops or as a separate storage unit, but thinner laptops or dual-drive system laptops abstain from them because of their size.    mSATA SSD:      This type of SSD is much smaller than the 2.5” drive and is a bare circuit. It is used as a drive in netbooks, laptops, small form factor PCs, and other devices that require a smaller footprint. mSATA might come with any kind of\xa0 SATA interface (I, II or III). This form factor is phasing out because of M.2 SSD.    M.2 SSD     The SSD having M.2 connector is also called next-generation form factor ( NGFF)  because it comes in various widths and lengths. M.2 SSD is similar to mSATA and also comes in as a bare circuit board. It is also flexible as it can use both SATA or PCIe Interface. The connector on M.2 has three section which can be seen in the picture while mSATA has two sections.  PCI Express (PCIe) SSD   PCI Express interface has a transfer rate of 8\xa0GT/s bit which can effectively deliver 985\xa0MB/s per lane. This type of SSD is the most expensive in terms of price per gigabyte. However, SSD using this interface gives the best performance. It is suitable for desktops.  NOTE: 2.5"",mSATA, M.2 are form factors (the size and connector type)and has no impact on performance. SATA-I, SATA-II,SATA-III and PCIExpress are interfaces and this will determine the performance ofyour SSD.  How to choose the right SSD  I hope I was successful in clarifying you about the types (forms and interfaces) of SSDs that are available in the market. Now, that you are informed about SSDs, let me tell you about the features you should consider before purchasing an SSD.   Interface   We talked about different interfaces SSDs could have. My recommendation is, you should get SATA Express or SATA III for better performance. However, you should first check if your computer is compatible with the newer SATA types. If your motherboard has SATA Express interface then it will be compatible with all SATA types (I, II, III). A newer SATA interface is backward compatible with older SATA but older SATA interface on your computer might not support newer SATA version.  Remember, you might not get the most out of SSDs if your computer doesn’t support newer SATA interface.    Length and Size of SSD    This feature should go without saying. You should check if SSD will fit in your laptop before you buy one. For example, 2.5-inch SSD, although comes in different thickness, may not fit inside your computer. You should probably buy mSATA or M.2 if you have thinner laptops (both mSATA and M.2 comes in various sizes, so choose the right size).    Actual Speed    SSD companies will not tell you about the real-world read-write speed because they are slower. Usually, SSD manufacturers advertise the sequential read/write speed of SSD because the values are higher. Sequential read/write speed is the speed with which you can copy huge chunks of data from one place to another. However, in daily usages, the computer transfers small chunks of data here and there while interacting with the applications. This type of transfer is measured with 4K read/write speed. Therefore, you should also look at the 4K performance of the SSD.  So, before you buy an SSD, you should check the benchmark tests for the specific SSD. If the benchmark score is close to 2/3 of the sequential speed, it is the best SSD for your money.    Multi-Level Cell (MLC) NAND flash:    There are two types of memory you will find in SSDs that are available in the market. One is Single Level Cell NAND and the other is Multi-Level Cell NAND (you may find Triple Level Cell also, but they do not perform that well). Although SLC is best in regard to performance, they are expensive. Therefore, if you are shopping for SSD, go for MLC as they would give you the best bang for your buck.    Write Cycles:    Unlike old HDDs, SDDs have a limit on how many times you can re-write on them before they wear out. SSDs have a limited number of erase cycles. So, before buying an SSD, look at the rated number of erase cycles provided by the manufacturers. Most SSDs will have the ratings of\xa0 3000 to 5000 erase cycles. This means, if you are a normal user, your SSD will typically last for more than 5 years but the performance will degrade with time. Therefore, choose an SSD with a large number of erase cycles if you are planning to use it for a long time.    ECC Memory:    ECC stands for Error-Correcting Code. ECC Memory provides your SSD with the ability to detect and correct common types of data corruption so that you don’t end up with unusable data on your drive. So, get an SSD with ECC memory because it is more reliable.    TRIM:    You should get an SSD that supports TRIM command. TRIM is necessary to manage the data cleaning process in SSD. If your SSD is TRIM compatible, your OS can execute the TRIM command to make your drive last longer without degrading the performance.  Gadgetbyte Recommends: Buy SATA III with good 4k performance and TRIM capability.  Tips for optimizing your SSD  If you are still with me, I am now going to give you some tips on how to optimize your SSD. First of all, most of the newer SSDs are becoming so advanced that you don’t need to worry about optimizing them. Secondly, a newer version of  Windows (7, 8 and 10) will automatically optimize your SSD  because SSDs are very common these days. That being said, you should not forget to do the following things to make sure your SSD last longer:   Enable TRIM command in your OS if it is not already enabled  Update the firmware of your SSD']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ssd-feature.png']

['LG G6 : Teaser Video Breakdown'],['LG'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 13, 2017']",2017-01-13 08:25:30+00:00,"['Mobile World Congress (MWC) has a\xa0date and so does the announcement of flagship phones of 2017. MWC 2017 will be held in Barcelona, Spain from 27th February. Preceding that, flagships from Samsung, Nokia, and LG are expected to get announced on 26th February.\xa0As the announcement dates get closer, the internet is crowded with the rumors. It is hard to rely on rumors but we can count on them when it is from the manufacturer themselves. LG has uploaded a teaser video titled “Wishlist for the ideal smartphone” and from that we can make solid guesses on how the LG G6, next flagship from LG, gonna be like.  LG’s Teaser Video Breakdown   In the video Wishlist for the ideal smartphone, we see random people giving their views on how a phone should be. It starts with demanding of a bigger screen.\xa0At the same time, people want the\xa0phone to be not that big and should come handy for one hand usability. Additionally, they say they want the phone to have some good grips. The ideal phone should come with water resistance is what they said. Then they add the phone should capture all at once hinting at a wider lens. More Reliability is included in the wishlist and that hints toward phone to have durable builds. In this post, I’ll be breaking down the wishlist to give you an overview of what we can expect from the LG G6.        Bigger Screen: 5.7 inch Screen with QHD+ and Aspect Ratio of 18:9  The screen that we will be seeing will be of 5.7 inches. Since it’s going to be extra tall – extra wide screen, the aspect ratio will be of 18:9. This screen will come at a resolution of 2880 * 1440 pixels.  Big screen but not a big phone: no or tiny bezels  For a phone with a big screen to be not that big, it should have no or tiny bezels. So the LG G6 will have tiny bezels and more than the traditional screen to body ratio. Unlike LG V20, the phone will not have a secondary display which is something many of us want to have in phones of 2017.  Capture all at once: dual cameras with wide angle  Like LG G5, the G6 will have dual cameras in the back with one lens having a wider angle than the another. That way you can pack more in your photos or videos taken from the phone. But will the phone get a Megapixel bump or will pack the same units from its predecessor is something we can’t have a word on yet.  Water Proof: Water resistance is\xa0something every flagship of 2017 should include  Even the Apple, has now made its phone water resistant so LG was kind of lagging when it came to Waterproofing in a phone. But now, the LG G6 will be the first water resistant phone from LG. Well, Better late than never, LG.  More Reliable: Corning Gorilla Glass 5?  LG seems to be confident about making well-protected screens. The LG G5 already had Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. So, LG might be stepping up its game and is likely to include Corning Gorilla Glass 5 screen protection in its next flagship of 2017.  More Rumors  That was what the teaser video had hinted. But there are still more worth considering rumors on LG G6.\xa0Unlike LG G5, the G6 won’t be of a modular type. Well, LG has learned its lessons by releasing an oddly openable phone right from the chin. Since LG G6 will have water resistance, it won’t have any parts removable. But will it have a 3.5 headphone jack or not is something even we are eager to know about. Like LG V20, the phone will come with Android Nougat out of the box. There are more to be uncovered about the LG G6, like the chip it’ll be using and the amount of RAM it’ll pack inside. We’ll surely share that with you in days to come when we’ll have more rumors from trustworthy sources. Stay tuned.  So, what are your views towards LG G6? Do you think it can share the limelight with Samsung Galaxy S8? Or, just like the last year, the Samsung’s flagship will overshadow that of LG? Let us know in the comments.']",[]

We can assume that one of the announcements is related to its flagship for 2017, the Nokia 8. We might probably even witness the release of some other mid-rangers.  Read More:  Know about new Nokia and HMD Global        For those of you wondering what special thing 26th February holds, it is the day before Mobile World Congress 2017 starts.  HMD Global released Nokia 6 without any advance announcement.  As for the leaks and renders of the Nokia 8, there have been lots of rumors circulating around the internet\xa0 Recently, a YouTuber posted a video showing Nokia 8’s design. Qualcomm had reportedly showcased the flagship at CES asking people not to take any pictures or videos, but the YouTuber somehow managed to take a video and some pictures.  Design-wise, the device seems to feature no physical buttons. And it looks as though Nokia 8 will be equipped with dual front facing speakers.  If some rumors are considered, Nokia 8 will sport a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) display. While most smartphone manufacturers are now switching towards an edge-display technology, HMD Global will still stick with a flat display panel. It has also been reported that the device will house a 24-megapixel rear facing camera that will support Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and Super Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS). The front facing camera could probably house a 12-megapixel sensor. It is also believed to feature Carl Zeiss Optics like in the previous Nokia smartphones.  Nokia 8 will probably be released in two variants: one running on Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset along with 6GB of RAM and another variant running on Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset with 4GB of RAM. Storage wise, the device might feature 64GB and 128GB of internal storage with an option to expand it via a microSD card.  We, however, don’t have any news on its pricing.

The first phone  HTC U Ultra  is a flagship phone from HTC and comes with all the flagship specs you can expect. And, the second phone is named  HTC U Play , which is a mid-range phone.  The new U series is quite unique in design because their whole body is made of glass, yes even the back. HTC calls it “Liquid Surface construction”. The phone looks glossy with this new material that mimics and looks like liquid. This liquid looking design makes the exterior little slippery so you might need a case to hold it firmly.        Additionally, HTC also brings its new AI called  Sense Companion  in the U series. Sense Companion is a voice-controlled intelligence from HTC, much like the Google Assistant, S Voice, Siri. The Sense Companion is will respond to your commands. And, will also learn your behavior and interests to make your phone more personalized i.e more U.  Furthermore, the HTC U Ultra will have a second screen just above the main screen. The second screen will show notifications and AI responses. The reason for putting the little screen, a ticker, according to the company, is mainly so that the AI doesn’t obstruct your main screen experience. This means, AI will only interact on the second screen. Also, with the second screen, the whole display need not be turned on to show notifications during standby. This, I hope, will save the battery because the phone has low capacity battery for a 5.7 inch screen. Well, at least in the U Ultra because U Play doesn’t have the second screen.  Moreover, HTC’s U series has always-on voice detection, which allows  Sense Companion  to interact with you even when the is display off. You can also use  voice-based bio-metric  authentication to unlock the phone.  However, the HTC U Ultra and HTC U Play doesn’t have 3.5 mm headphone jack.

['Research shows we destroy our phone on purpose'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 12, 2017']",2017-01-12 07:33:02+00:00,"['Did you recently drop your phone? And what do you do when the screen of your phone gets shattered? I, obviously, would prefer a new phone with new high-end features to replacing the screen– if I have the budget of course.  If you are like me and have been dropping or misplacing your phone more often these days, research shows you are doing it on purpose. Because, unconsciously, you want that latest phone.  A study carried out by researchers Josh Ackerman, Silvia Bellezza, and Francesca Ginain found that right when a new phone is released, people tend to be more reckless with their phones. The research paper was published in  Journal of Marketing Research .        Researchers called it “ upgrade effect ” and defined it as a phenomenon in which “careless tendencies are intended to promote the acquisition of upgrade products by helping consumers justify the new purchase.”  “When we ask people if this is something you would normally do, the vast majority say no,” Ackerman said to Gizmodo of casually leaving phones behind or dropping them. “Which suggests that people just don’t realize that this behavior is going on.”  Researchers believe that this behavior of unconsciously, but to a certain degree, “deliberately” damaging or losing our product is to avoid the guilt of upgrading. If we lose or break our phone, we would get a reason to justify our upgrade.  ‘We would feel guilty about upgrading without a reason – but if our current product were damaged or depleted, we’d have a justification to upgrade without appearing wasteful,’ said Columbia Business School Professor Silvia Bellezza.  In the research, the researchers looked into the IME Detective Database: online lost and found system. When people find a phone, they can search the IME number on the database to check if the owner has reported it stolen, and if there is any reward. Analyzing the figures of iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S on the database, t he scientists found out that as soon as the 5S was released, iPhone 5 owners spent less time looking for their lost phones.    The “upgrade effect” applies to other products as well, according to the report. When the participants see or decide to buy a new product, they start overusing their products– their shampoos, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and perfume.

['Tootle – a new way to get/give a ride in Kathmandu'],['Apps'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 11, 2017']",2017-01-11 10:00:07+00:00,"['In the days of blockade, we had done carpooling and it was a neat experience. It was exciting to give or get a free ride. Now carpooling has become a thing of past. The mode of transportation in the capital is limited to\xa0same traditional means of public vehicles. Moving around the\xa0capital isn’t that easy and public vehicles make it worst. With overcrowded buses and heavy traffic, our daily mobility is kind of limited. Renting a taxi isn’t that affordable on a daily basis. But a new ray of hope has lightened the city with the introduction of “Tootle”.  What is Tootle?  Tootle is a new initiative that is brought to serve the people in the valley. It is a cool and easy way of getting and giving rides within the capital. Since it is a service, it is not something for free. However, the charges are kind of minimal when compared with taxi fares. Currently, tootle rides can be booked only from 8 am to 8 pm.  How to\xa0get/give a tootle ride?      Tootle and Tootle Partner UI (ScreenShots)   1  of 6                                                                              There are these two different Tootle apps that can be found in Google Play Store. Apple users need to wait for a little while but iOS apps are also just around the corner. Tootle and Tootle Partner are the apps you should download. If you just need to book a ride you can do so by signing up for the Tootle app. But if you want to earn some extra cash\xa0by offering a ride to others then you will need to have a Tootle Partner app on your phone. Signing up in any of these apps is simply. All you need to do is fill up some details and then you’ll be good to go. However, you need to upload a photo of your driving license to become a Tootle Partner.        Click me to Download Tootle  Click me to Download Tootle Partner  How does the Tootle app work?  Let’s start with how to\xa0book your tootle ride. Open the tootle app and login with your details (first time only). Then you select your pickup location and destination location and tap on “book”. The app will generate the shortest route for your ride and calculate your fare for the ride. You can choose your mode of payment which can be from\xa0tootle balance or by cash. You can select your time of departure that can be\xa0right now or 15/30/60 minutes later. Once, you hit “confirm”. You’ll get a unique ride code and a notification will be sent to online Tootle Partners and once a tootle partner accepts the book request. Your ride will be started as shortly as possible. Once you reach your destination, you’re supposed to give that ride code to your rider and that way Tootle team will be notified about your successful tootling.  What is Tootle Balance and what can you do with it?  Since Tootle is in its introductory phase, it is giving free tootle balance worth Rs. 500 for every new sign up. You can use that tootle balance for booking your next tootle ride. Once you run out of balance, you can top up your Tootle Balance via e-sewa or a Tootle Voucher. Plus more modes of payment for the top up are just down the road.  What about the Tootle Balance earned by the Tootle Partners?  Once you become a Tootle Partner you’ll get a free tootle balance worth Rs. 200. Once you start accepting Tootle booking and on every successful tootling you do, you’ll notice increments in your balance. You can then transfer your topped up balance to your e-sewa and use it your own way.  Verdict  Lastly, I’d like to address few dark sides of the Tootle. There are few things you might wanna consider. Will you trust a stranger to be your companion for a bike ride? I’ll let you decide that on your own. Yes, there are chances for things to go wrong. So, it is you who should be cautious. Plus, sometimes a book request might not be a genuine one. Someone could\xa0have pulled a prank on you. You might go accepting a book request and what if no one shows up. So it will be wiser for the developer to make some amount of balance reduction right while\xa0placing a ride request. That way, non-serious users won’t be placing the\xa0orders. To be a Tootle partner is not that easy, you’ve to turn on your mobile data and GPS all the time. I’m not sure how much of mobile balance it’s gonna cost you. One thing I’m sure of\xa0is there will be a noticeable drain in your phone’s battery status.  Well, it is an appreciable initiative that needs your support. So, I want you guys to try it yourself and help redefine the way one moves around the capital. I’ve tried the apps myself and they were pretty user-friendly and easy to catch with. Honestly speaking, I haven’t done a tootling yet but I’m\xa0looking forward to doing one this evening on my way back home. It’s always good to earn\xa0some extra cash and have a companion on my usual\xa0route. But before booking a tootle, make sure you put a mask in your pocket, you know how dusty Kathmandu\xa0roads have become\xa0lately. Happy Tootling.  What do you think of this new initiative? Will it be something Epic or Fail? Let us know in the comments down below.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Feature-Image-Tootle-1068x559-1.jpg']

Now in order to boost its revenue, Facebook is hoping to add advertisements in the middle of videos.  According to  Statistica , when Facebook’s revenue was $17.928 billion, it made an annual revenue of $17.08 billion from the advertising. In the same year, each Facebook account has been a source of income of $10.73 to the Facebook. Lots us people might be in shock, how did it made so much of income from one when we had paid none. When we are not paying for the product, we will be\xa0traded\xa0as the products. That is what Facebook is doing. According to the information on our profile like age (birth date), sex, page likes, etc, Facebook builds a general outlook of the certain individual. And Facebook lures sponsors with that information and sells them. Matching those aspects, they advertise their products to us. This is the reason why we could see the advertisements of the certain commercial companies suggested by Facebook to like them. Now Facebook is planning to increase its income by adding video ads of those companies in the midst of Facebook videos.  Ads in the Facebook will be similar to the ad videos in the YouTube. However, unlike YouTube, Facebook is hoping to add video ads of around 15 seconds after the elapsed video time of 20 seconds. And this addition will be limited to the videos longer than 90 seconds. According to our source, Facebook will make a split of 55% of income from the ad sales to the creators.        This step is surely going to be profitable for sponsors, creators and obviously Facebook. This endeavor is also going to increase the job opportunities for Facebook, which is also a good thing. However, the video ads if acted terrible to the video lovers then Facebook will certainly be losing some of its products (users). However, this scheme has not yet been started.

Right after I started the game for the first time, I found it to be too slow and generic type. I was just about to quit but the obstacles like “Safa Tampo”, “Nepal Yatayat”, “Sajha Bus” seemed to excite me. However, the game is easy to play. There’s not much of control to worry about; tap for a short jump and long press for a high jump. Just avoid obstacles and collect coins. That’s it.

Situated at in Kaski, the place serves as the starting point of the trekking route that leads to ABC.  Even though Kaski is doing really\xa0well in terms of development, it still falls behind in the educational sector. Students have to walk miles just to get to their schools. So, keeping this in mind, Samsung has opened its own ‘smart class’ in Birethanti. The smart class is the first of its kind in Nepal.  For those of you who are unaware of this project, the Samsung smart class is the Korean company’s very own initiative that works to decrease gaps that exist between rural and urban places by acting as a bridge. While doing so, it treats and serves all students of all backgrounds equally.        The school, Shree Birethanti Secondary School, teaches around 230 students.  Source: Samsung newsroom  Talking about the initiative, Yubeom Won, Vice President of Samsung Electronics, said, “We want to support Nepali people because it’s a developing country. That’s why we have planned a Samsung Smart Class in Nepal. We plan to take the digital experience to more areas and more people in the future.”  Yubeom Won, Vice President of Samsung Electronics.  “Digital is a very high technique and art is a very old technique. The harmony between high technique and old technique is good for our students,” said Ku Hyun-Kim, Shree Birethanti’s painting teacher. He also added that this initiation by Samsung has created huge interests in students.  Using interactive methods such as videos and presentations through technologies like tablets, interactive smartboard, and other devices, the children are taught in a modern environment, making it easier for them to understand.  According to Samsung, the company has helped in setting up around 2,500 smart classes all over the world, helping over a whopping 700,000 students.  “We are very happy that Samsung Smart Class has come to our school. We are lucky,” said Ranjana Magar, a student.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/students.jpg']
['Air Purifying Drone Unveiled at CES 2017'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 10, 2017']",2017-01-10 08:13:33+00:00,"['Air pollution has, undoubtedly, been a hindrance not only to us but to many other nations in the world. Air purifiers are also not new to us. Different tech companies have released air purifiers including Xiaomi. But now, at the Consumer Electronics Show, a flying air purifier has been unveiled.  Yes, it is true. World’s first flying air purifier has now become a reality. All thanks go to Ataraina designer for revealing the air purifying drone at the 2017 rendition of the CES in Las Vegas, Nevada. Besides the flying air purifier, a shoe insert that purifies feet stinks has also been unveiled at the show.         The Flying Magic Cleaner is a drone-based system that removes dust, pollen, PM 2.5 and other harmful particles from the air. PM 2.5 refers to the\xa0tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated.   Ataraina also revealed the Deodorant One technology. This is a shoe insert equipped with a radical sheet that can kill bacteria and remove feet odor.  As told to the Dailymail, the fabric that covers the drone has minus ions, and therefore, when it flies, it attracts pollutants and particles flying in the air. The drone\xa0generates an airflow as it flies, collecting particles that a vacuum would miss, the creators explained. Besides being able to clean houses, the devices is said to be usable in larger settings. The device, however, requires remote control instructions from humans and has no artificial intelligence embedded to prevent crashes and accidents.  The Deodorant One uses an ozone technology to kill germs. That is to say that it produces radicals, active oxygen, to eliminate nasty smells. It takes roughly an hour to disinfect the shoe and remove the odor– even for smells that are extremely potent.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ataraina-drone-air-purifier.jpg']
['Best of CES: Best laptops released at CES 2017'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['January 10, 2017']",2017-01-10 07:33:25+00:00,"['This year, like always, CES got to witness releases of some pretty awesome gadgets and technology. Laptop manufacturers launched many high-end devices at CES. So today, we have made you a list of the best laptops released at CES. Prev Next 1 HP Spectre x360 (2017)          After its success with the HP Spectre x360 (2016), HP has released its successor, the HP Spectre x360 (2017). The device features a gorgeous 4K display and is actually thicker and heavier than its predecessor, something we don’t usually see these days. But there is a catch to it. The HP Spectre x360 is equipped with a bigger battery, which the company claims to be 23 percent bigger than before. But the upgraded display means that the bigger battery won’t be extending the battery life. The new HP Spectre x360 (2017) will be available at the end of February with the price of $1,249 in the international market. 2 Razer’s Project Valerie          Would you be happier if your laptop featured three displays instead of just a single one? If the answer is in affirmative, then Razor’s Project Valerie might be the perfect device for you. The Valerie consists of a pile of displays that can slide into a three-screen setup. The three displays mean an added thickness and weight, but hey, that’s the device features three huge screens. The Razer Valarie is a VR-ready laptop and weighs at 1.5 kilos. Like its name suggests, the Valerie is still a project and we don’t really know much about its specs. Regarding the price, since Razer’s previous device, the Blade Pro was priced at $3,499, we can expect the Valarie to be priced around $6,000 if it ever gets launched. 3 Acer Predator 21X          Another gaming laptop released at CES was Acer’s Predator 21X which made headlines for its ludicrous price of $9,000 ($8,999 to be precise). The device features a curved 21-inch display (resolution of 2,560×1,080 pixels), the first in any laptop. It is a heavy-duty laptop and weighs a staggering 8.8 kilograms. Safe to say, it is a bit heavy. Talking about its specs, it is equipped with two Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs, five system fans, nine heat pipes to stay cool, four speakers and two sub-woofers, Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and a staggering 64GB of system memory. 4 LG Gram 14          Dubbed as the world’s lightest laptop, LG’s Gram 14 is a little like its predecessor. It weighs at just 966 grams with the company promising an amazing 23.6 hours of battery life. LG has, however, used a decade-old benchmark test to show that its product runs for that long. The LG Gram 14 features a full metal body which is made of a nano carbon magnesium alloy. It comes with a 13-inch and a 15-inch variant. Both variants feature displays of 1920 x 1080 pixels IPS touchscreens. It is powered by Intel’s newest Kabylake processor. 5 Lenovo Legion          Like many manufacturers, Lenovo too launched a gaming laptop, the Legion Y720. It is a VR-ready laptop that is powered by Intel’s seventh generation i7-7700HQ processor which is coupled with 6GB of GDDR5 RAM (optional 32GB of DDR4 RAM) and Nvidia GTX 1060. Buyers will have an option of choosing between a 1080p or a 4K variant. It is backed up by a 60Wh battery which the company has claimed will last for five hours. The Lenovo Legion’s pricing starts from $1,399 and will be available this April. 6 Asus Pro B9440          The Asus Pro B9440 sports a 14-inch full HD display. Asus has claimed the device to be the lightest ‘business notebook in its class’. It weighs at just 1.04kg which the company has said is the result of thin bezel around the display and the usage of lightweight magnesium alloy. Under the hood, the Asus Pro B9440 is powered by Intel Core i5 or i7 processor which is supported by 16GB RAM. It also features a fingerprint sensor making your laptop more secure. The Asus Pro B9440 carries a price tag of $999 and will hit the shelves this in May. 7 Toshiba Portégé X20W          Claiming an impressive 16 hours of battery life, Toshiba launched the Portégé X20W, a high-end convertible, at CES. Talking about the specs, the device is powered by a seventh-generation Intel Core i5 processor that is a couple with 8GB of RAM. It can offer the best of both tablet and a PC since it is a convertible. It features two infrared cameras which support Windows Hello facial recognition. The Portégé X20W is accompanied by a TruPen stylus. However, the Toshiba Portégé X20W only features a USB-C with Thunderbolt port and a USB 3.0 connection port which is a real bummer. With pricing starting from $1,199, the device will be available for ordering starting mid-January 8 Acer Chromebook 11 N7          The Chromebook 11 N7 might be low on specs, but Acer has built the device to withstand all kind of pressure. Specs wise, the device isn’t a high-end laptop. It is equipped with an Intel Celeron dual-core processor that is clocked at 1.60Ghz along with 4GB of RAM. On the storage front, there are two variants – 16GB and 32GB, which is too less in the present time. It has a battery life of around 15 hours. But what makes Acer Chromebook 11 N7 worth $299.99? Acer has put the device through tons of testing to make the device really tough. It can withstand drops up to 122cm (48 inches) and is U.S. military’s MIL-STD 810G standards certified. It is also equipped with an internal gutter system that can protect the device against liquid spills. Even though the device weighs in at just around 1.35kg, it is quite durable and affordable. 9 Lenovo Miix 720          The Lenovo Miix 720 is a 12-inch tablet running on Windows 10. The device comes with a detachable keyboard cover and a kickstand that can adjust the viewing angle around 150 degrees.

The laptop comes with an Infrared camera for Windows Hello and a fingerprint sensor. Dell hasn’t however disclosed the price of the XPS 13 2-in-1 yet. 11 Samsung Notebook 9          Powered by a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor alongside 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the Samsung Notebook 9 combines portability and power in a single device.

It is equipped with two USB 3.0 ports and a single USB-C port. The price, however, hasn’t been disclosed yet. 12 Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon          Fifth in the line of X1 Carbon series, the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon is an upgrade to its predecessor by many means.

Pricing starts at $1,349. 13 Asus Chromebook Flip C302          Asus’ another release was the Chromebook Flip C302, a successor to the Chromebook Flip released last year.

It is so small that you might confuse it for a credit card. It measures 94.5 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm. This Intel Compute Card is a replacement for  Intel Compute Stick  that was available on the market a few years ago.  Credit: Gizmodo YouTube  Now, if you use ARM-based Raspberry Pi, this Compute Card is similar to it.        So, what’s new about Intel Compute Card? Well, first of all, you can choose from wide range of Intel Processors including 7th generation processors. Secondly, unlike Raspberry Pi (which is great for DIY projects for gadgets geeks), Intel Compute Card is easy to use and ready-made. This means everyone can simply connect devices to it and enjoy the computing!  According to Intel, the Compute Card was designed to transform the way compute and connectivity can be integrated and used in future devices. The main focus is making Internet of Things more flexible, resourceful and powerful. For example, if you smart TV starts to slow down, you could just replace the chip of Smart TV with Intel Compute Card instead of buying a new TV. This could be good for the environment too- less electronic waste.  Additionally, Intel is currently working with companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp.

['Huawei GR5 2017 Review : Dual Cameras at work'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 8, 2017']",2017-01-08 07:39:37+00:00,"['Huawei , the maker of\xa0the Nexus 6p, is the widely known worldwide for providing specs-heavy phones at cheaper prices. It is with the release of  Huawei P9 , people started to talk about cameras right before talking about other aspects of the phone.  Dual-cameras  in the back is something we’ve been seeing a lot in high-end flagships lately but there are only handful of mid-range devices to sport the dual-cam setup and Huawei GR5 2017 is certainly one of those. Under 30,000 price segment,  Samsung Galaxy J7 prime  and  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3  are being sold like hot cakes in the Nepali market. So can this phone stand out the crowd and make its strong standings among the phones in similar price range. Let’s find out from this review, if Huawei GR5 2017 is the best camera phone you can buy under 30K or not.      Huawei GR5 2017   1  of 3                                                Build  Huawei GR5 doesn’t sport any unique design but does look classy. The phone, with a curved back and rounded edges, \xa0feels premium while holding. From the front, it looks like an iPhone-wannabe. On the back, it is almost all metal with plastic panels at the top and bottom. The vertically placed dual cameras in the back can be found near the top. The third generation rounded fingerprint scanner is well placed just below the rear cameras. All in all, the build quality is top-notch but the phone is a little slippery with its smooth finish. So, snapping a back cover or putting in some skins may be considered a\xa0better idea.  Display         Huawei GR5 2017 comes with a 5.5 inch IPS LCD display that has the resolution of 1920*1080 pixels. This display is a praiseworthy one with good color reproduction and great viewing angles. Talking about the display, what I like the most is the option to customize the white balance. The white can be made warmer or cooler as per one’s preference. Plus, for those who are into using their phones at the night by filtering the blue color, there’s an option for that too.  Software  On the software side, the phone boots on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Huawei’s own EMUI 4.1 layered on top. For those coming from stock-like android UI, this UI might feel a little alien. For instance, while scrolling from the status bar notifications come out first and to reach quick settings you’ve to swipe from the right. But once you get used to it, you’ll certainly make the best out of it. Personally, I prefer stock-like android experience as opposed to a heavily skinned UI\xa0without an app drawer.      Huawei GR5 2017 UI (Screenshots)   1  of 5                                                                    Performance  Under the hood, the phone is powered by Huawei’s own HiSilicon Kirin\xa0655 octa-core processor with\xa0Mali T830-MP2, the first four cores are clocked at 2.1GHz and the remaining four are clocked at 1.7 GHz. This hardware configuration seems to be a perfect match with\xa03GB LPDDR3 RAM giving an outstanding performance. The gaming performance is satisfactory but the phone heats up a bit while gaming. But that is something common in many phones these days. Multitasking is great but I wish if the app tiles were organized in vertical ordering than the horizontal one. On the storage side, it has the built-in memory of 32GB that can be expanded up to 128GB via microSD card but that will use the SIM2 slot.  Camera  On the front, there’s a 8 Megapixels camera which does a decent job of taking selfies and video calling. There’s this beauty mode for selfies that can be scaled from 1 to 10 but works the best at the level of 5. On the back, there’s a set of two lenses of 12 Megapixels and 2 Megapixels placed vertically which are the charm of this device.      Huawei GR5 2017 Camera   1  of 2                                      This dual camera setup aids in faster focus and gives nice bokeh effect to the portraits. At times, yes the bokeh effect wasn’t as perfect and seemed a little artificial. But I should agree that with dual cameras there was some noticeable depth in the photos. If you have a time and tripod, you can get artistic with its camera using modes like tail lights, light graffiti, silky water, star track that can be found under light painting mode. One can make a lot out of this camera phone that has multiple camera modes including pro mode for both photos and videos.      Sample Photos   1  of 2                                      Personally, I found pro mode for videos to be really impressive. Not many phones have manual options for videos. Those who are into Vlogging from their phone camera might find this feature really handy. Videos can be taken at the highest resolution of 1080p@30fps.  Connectivity  Huawei GR5 2017 supports dual nano SIM that can be either of (4G)FDD/TDD or (3G)UMTS or (2G)GSM. It has Bluetooth 4.1 but doesn’t include the\xa0NFC. For WLAN, it has Wi-Fi802.11b/g/n, 2.4GHz but no 802.11ac. Hence the device won’t support dual band wireless technology.  Battery  The phone houses a 3340mAh battery that will even suffice the needs of hardcore users. The battery performance is remarkably good and can be optimized for much longer usage as well. Plus, it even supports the quick charge. Huawei claims the phone can easily get up to 2 days of battery life mark in normal usages. Honestly speaking, the unit I reviewed didn’t last for 2 whole days but I was able to get around 1 and half days from this phone on my regular usage before the battery died. Additionally, battery drained a little faster when I left my 4G on all day. With 4G always on I made through a day with this phone at its best.  Verdict      Huawei GR5 2017   1  of 4                                                          Huawei GR5 2017 is all in all the best camera phone that one can buy under 30K. But, it doesn’t boast a unique or innovative design. Specs-wise, it doesn’t surpass other phones of the similar price range but comes neck and neck. If I were to choose between Samsung Galaxy J7 prime and this phone, I would certainly go with Huawei GR5 2017 without any second thoughts. But if you happen to be a power user, you might want to go with Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 but if you want a phone that is all-rounder then GR5 2017 is the right phone for you. In nutshell, Huawei GR5 2017 is an appreciable upgrade to its predecessor with a faster chip, bigger RAM, greater storage, better cameras and upgraded battery.']",[]

The profit from the Semiconductor Division stood  at 2.7 trillion won, its highest in more than four years. There was a healthy demand for memory chips, used in servers and handsets including Apple iPhones, as well as improved sales from its system chips business.        In the mobile division, in spite of the ban on the production of the Note 7, which cost the company over billions, the sales of the Galaxy S7 and other models have remained strong. Therefore,\xa0Samsung is on track to achieve its strongest quarterly profit numbers in more than three years.  Recently, as the Korean won has weakened against the dollar, Samsung has been in advantage as Samsung gets paid in the latter for component sales.

The phone is expected to launch in Nepal next month with pricing being around Rs. 30,000.  The ZTE Blade V8 offers an exquisite design — thanks to its Metallic finish & curved edge 2.5D screen. It sports a 5.2-inch FullHD IPS LCD display and is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 Octacore processor. Storage wise, it comes with either 2GB RAM/16GB ROM or 3GB RAM/32GB ROM. Both these variant supports microSD card. We expect to see the 3GB RAM variant in Nepal. The USP of the device is its dual camera setup of 13MP and 2MP which lets you take some good bokeh photos. The front houses a 13MP selfie camera with flash.         The ZTE Blade V8 ships with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Connectivity options include dual-SIM with 4G LTE and VOLTE, GPS, USB OTG, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, and Bluetooth 4.1. There’s plenty of sensors embedded in the phone like Fingerprint (on the front), Accelerometer, Proximity, Ambient Light, Gyroscope, Compass, and Hall sensor. Backing up the phone is a non-removable 2730mAh battery with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 technology.

['This VR alternative will change your movie experience'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 6, 2017']",2017-01-06 11:05:02+00:00,"['There has been a lot of development in VR and AR in recent years. And these technologies are expected to be the most liked consumer product in following years. Even at CES 2017, VR and AR are a hot topic.  I know VR and AR are cool, but the technology still lacks perfection. The problem with VR and AR is, beside the headsets, you will also need a device that is compatible with it. All those wires and apps, ugh!  VR and AR are capable of many things besides watching movies or videos. However, if you are buying a VR because you just want to enjoy 360-degree videos, I have a better option for you!  Avegant’s Glyph!         What is Glyph?  Glyph is a multimedia device by Avegant that basically looks like a standard headphone. With Glyph, you can watch your favorite movies at a resolution of 1280x720p. Plus, you don’t need to put your phone in the headset. Additionally, you can easily carry it around– a portable movie theater for you!  How does Glyph work?   The glyph has two small eyepieces. Each eyepiece can be adjusted independently — both distance and focus — until it seems like one giant screen.  You can just plug\xa0Avegant Glyph into any HDMI-supported device and it will display the screen in front of your eyes. Yes, any devices– smartphones, computers, drones, gaming console, camera or casting devices. If you want to listen to only audio, it also has a 3.5mm audio jack.  Plus, unlike VR, I like the fact that I can still be aware of my surrounding as Glyph lets me see above and below the visual field. However, some of you may not like this feature.  Specifications of Glyph:    Resolution: 1280x720p per eye; 2 million micromirrors    Aspect Ratio: 16:9    Field of view: ~40° diagonal    Video & Audio Input: microHDMI    Audio-Only Input: 3.5mm TRRS (standard AUX)    Frequency Response: 20Hz-20kHz    Dynamic Range: 95 dB    Battery: Li-Ion 2060mAH, Up to 4 hours video playback, unlimited passive audio    Charging Port: microUSB    Diopter Adjustment: +1 to -7 range    Head tracking: 9 Axis IMU    3D: Supports 720p side by side (SBS) content    Updatable Firmware: For enhanced features and capabilities    Price of the Glyph:  The price of this awesome personal movie theater is $549 at Avegant’s official website.
