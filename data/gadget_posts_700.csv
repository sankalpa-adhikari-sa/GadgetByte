['Intel announced 5G modem at CES 2017'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 6, 2017']",2017-01-06 09:00:00+00:00,"['Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017 is up and running since 5th Jan. 2017. This CES 2017 is happening in Las Vegas, Nevada. The show will end on Jan. 8, 2017. The announces and releases in the show give a glimpse at the new advancements in the tech industry. We’ll be covering more about the new releases at CES in our following posts. It is the CES that gives us a hint at how the coming year will be like.  Intel, one of the tech giants, announced its 5G modem at CES this year. Yes, the Qualcomm had already unveiled its X50 back in October that allows downloads on a 5G network at speeds of up to 5Gbps. That is 10 to 20 times faster than the currently available fastest 4G LTE network. However, both the modems won’t reach the commercial consumer products until 2018.  This new Intel modem designed for 5G will be compatible with both high-frequency 28GHz band and low-frequency 3.3 GHz band. The 5G networks that are being tested in the United States and Korea transmit in 28GHz whereas those being tested in Europe and China are designed to transmit in 3.3GHz. Manufacturers can expect to get such sample 5G modems from the Intel in the second half of this year.        According to Intel, This single chip of 5G modem will support both millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-6GHz spectrum band\xa0incorporating Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), beam-forming technology, and advanced channel coding.  This 5G modem from Intel will not just be packed in mobile phones but is likely to be found in drones, autonomous self-driving cars, and more. In a video on 5G from Intel, 5G is said to be not just an upgrade to already existing mobile network technology. But, it is claimed to be a revolutionary transformation in mobile networks and the internet. Intel claims this new chip will aid in Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IOT) and Autonomous vehicles.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15902780_1327161693972323_1498732347_o.png']
['Asus revealed AR ready phone with 8GB RAM'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 6, 2017']",2017-01-06 08:41:40+00:00,"['It looks like some smartphone manufacturers are not going to wait till Mobile Congress to showcase their mobile phones.  The Taiwanese company, Asus,\xa0 revealed two new smartphones at CES 2017– Asus ZenFone AR and ZenFone 3 Zoom.\xa0 Both of these are high-end phones by Asus. Although Asus didn’t reveal the detail speciations and price, some basic specs were exhibited at the event. Let’s look at them.  Asus ZenFone AR features:  Asus ZenFone AR  First of all, Asus ZenFone AR is an AR ready phone like  Lenovo Phab 2 Pro . The phone supports  Google’s Tango AR technology . This means this phone comes with sensors which will allow motion tracking, depth perception, and area learning for extraordinary AR user experience on a smartphone using apps.        And, to achieve motion tracking and depth perception for great AR experience, this phone sports a\xa0  23-megapixel Sony IMX318  rear camera with TriTech+ autofocus system, dual-PDAF, second-gen Laser Focus, and continuous focus. The front camera on this phone is  8MP  and has f/2.0 aperture with an 85-degree wide angle lens.  Similarly, Asus ZenFone AR packs  Snapdragon 821 Quad-core processor  (the same processor that exists in Goole Pixel (XL) and One Plus 3T) which is supported with  8GB of RAM ! Therefore, we can expect some great performance from Asus ZenFone AR.  The  5.7-inch WQHD Super AMOLED  display, with the resolution of  2,560×1,440  pixels, on Asus ZenFone AR sounds very tempting.\xa0 Additionally, this phone will come with  Android Nougat 7.0 .\xa0 Furthermore, the phone will have up to  256GB  of inbuilt storage which will be expandable via microSD card (up to  128GB ) in a hybrid dual-SIM (Micro+Nano) configuration; a 3300mAh battery; USB 2.0 Type-C port, Bluetooth v4.2 and Wi-Fi 802.11ac connectivity.  This heavily loaded phone will be available in February and will be using vapour cooling system to address the problem of over-heating (that comes with high specs phone).  Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom Features:  Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom  Unlike the almighty Asus ZenFone AR, Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom is a camera phone that packs an astonishing  5,000mAh Battery . Plus, this is one of the thinnest and lightest phone that will be available in the market. It is 7.9 mm thick and weighs only 170 gms.  Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom has  5.5-inch full-HD  (1080×1920 pixels) AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 5 on the top. Additionally,  Snapdragon 625  processor will power the phone, which is usually used in mid-range phones. Moreover,\xa0Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom will come with Android 6.0. However,\xa0 for other specs like memory, we will have to wait till February.  Since Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom is all about photography, let’s look at the features of cameras it packs.   Two 12-megapixel rear cameras (one 25mm, one 56mm with 2.3x optical zoom) with Sony IMX362 sensor  A 13-megapixel front-facing selfie camera with a Sony IMX214 sensor, an f/2.0 aperture, and screen flash.  Portrait mode that is similar to the iPhone 7 Plus  Raw file support  Full manual mode  Enhanced low-light sensitivity']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/asus-zenfone-feature-1.png']
['ZTE Blade V8 Pro and HawkEye announced at CES'],['ZTE'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['January 6, 2017']",2017-01-06 04:10:42+00:00,"['This year has started off strong with the CES 2017 which gives us a clear roadmap of where the technology is heading. There has been a lot of new innovations in tech that we can’t keep track of and are not useful to us yet. But what gets our concern is, what will be the smartphones of 2017 be like? The answer is Dual Rear\xa0Cameras!\xa0At CES 2017, ZTE has\xa0announced  V8 Pro  which comes with a dual lens. Apart from that, they have also announced a crowdsourced project  Project CSX  or the Hawkeye.  ZTE Blade V8 Pro:  ZTE V8 Pro  is a budget phone which comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD display and is powered by Snapdragon 625 octacore processor. It also comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. The phone houses a fingerprint up front which also acts as a home button.   The phone has an appealing form factor and the rubber texture back gives it a stealth look and also makes it grippier on the hand.   The major highlight of the phone is its dual 13MP Camera which is used for the shallow depth of field effect ( Bokeh ). Among two lenses, one holds a monochromatic sensor which helps to capture the sharpness and depth of the photo. The mechanism is similar to what we’ve seen in P series of Huawei phones and recently the  GR5 2017  which goes head to head with the V8 pro in terms of specs and camera performance. V8 Pro also comes with a 3140mAh battery which ZTE claims lasts longer than their flagship, ZTE Axon 7. Also, it comes with Quick Charge 2.0.         ZTE Blade V8 Pro Specifications:   5.5inch Full HD Display @ 401ppi  Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Protection  Android OS, v6.0.1 (Marshmallow)  Qualcomm MSM8953 Snapdragon 625 Chipset  Octa-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A53  Adreno 506 GPU  3GB RAM  32GB Storage, Expandable up to 256GB  Dual 13 MP Rear Camera with phase detection autofocus, 4K@ 30fps  8MP Front Facing Camera  Dolby audio sound enhancement  USB Type C 1.0  Fingerprint Sensor  Quick Charge 2.0  Non-removable Li-Ion 3140 mAh battery   The phone is priced at $230 and we can expect the phone to hit the Nepali market around 3rd quarter this year.  ZTE Hawkeye:  ZTE Hawkeye  is a crowdsourced project where the idea and design of the phone come directly from the consumers. There have been many opinions on how the phone should be designed but the most upvotes were given to eye tracking for smartphone control and an adhesive back.  Eye Tracking  has currently been the feature focus which tracks the eye movement from its high-resolution front-facing camera and converts that movement into software commands that represent standard gesture motions. According to ZTE, you should be able to completely use the phone based on eye movement when it’ s complete. Also, to go with the eye tracking mechanism, ZTE has developed a special  Adhesive Case  which makes it stick to most of the common surfaces making it easy to read the eye gestures. ZTE hasn’t explained what makes this possible, for now, they are just calling it “Black Magic.”  ZTE Hawkeye Specifications:   5.5inch Full HD Display  Unlocked, 2 SIM slots for multiple band support*  Dual rear cameras with enhanced image and zoom capabilities  Hi-Fi audio  Fingerprint sensor  Large battery with quick charging capabilities  Android Nougat operating system (+ upgradable to latest versions)  Expandable Storage   (Specifications are still debatable as the phone is a prototype.)  Adhesive case backing allows the phone to be mounted on walls  The phone is currently on development stage and can be backed on  Kickstarter , you can pre-order the phone now for  $199  and it’ll ship worldwide as soon as it’s ready, probably in September.  The phone’s price is certain to get high after it’s production ready. [where-to-buy buy_id=21541]']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ZTE-V8-Pro.png']

Last year, BlackBerry announced that it was done with making smartphones themselves and will only focus on the software side of things to make it more secure and powerful. BlackBerry has outsourced the development of its phones to Chinese electronics company TCL who also happens to make Alcatel phones which explain the similarity in design of previous  BlackBerry DTEK  phones. While most of the smartphone manufacturer are focusing on the features of tomorrow, BlackBerry seems to be clinging to its traditional roots.  Source: Android Authority  Today on CES, BlackBerry showcased their brand-new smartphone, DTEK70 code-named  Mercury . A lot of leaks had appeared suggesting a new BlackBerry phone with a keyboard which most of us found stupid but it’s a reality now. Unlike the Blackberry Priv, Mercury doesn’t have a sliding keyboard, so the keys are here to stay. The keyboard also acts as a trackpad which takes swiping gestures to make browsing and typing easier. The cool thing, though, spacebar acts as a home button and fingerprint sensor.  BlackBerry Mercury  packs a tiny 4.5inch Full HD display and comes with Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Design wise, it looks really robust with industrial rectangular design and curved edges. Despite being showcased at CES, the specs haven’t been made clear as BlackBerry states the phone is still a prototype. But based on few leaks earlier, the Mercury will be powered by Snapdragon 625/821 processor with 3GB RAM and 32GB Internal storage. The phone is running the latest Android version 7.0 Nougat which is almost stock like and will have a lot of BlackBerry services and security features.The phone will feature a 3,400mAh battery and comes with fast charging. Blackberry has managed to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack alive despite the use of USB C. The phone is likely to have an 18MP rear camera and 8MP front-facing camera.         These are all the specs about Mercury that is out there, the phone is still a prototype and BlackBerry stated that the phone will officially launch during the  Mobile World Congress (MWC)  in Barcelona late February. We can expect the price to be around $500 as BlackBerry’s doesn’t come cheap. [where-to-buy buy_id=21562]']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cover-qualified.jpg']

You can now apply for MRP Passport with an app!  Department of Passport, Nepal launched a mobile application called Nepal Passport yesterday.\xa0 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prakash Sharan Mahat, officially inaugurated the app yesterday at DoP office in Narayanhiti. You can download the app from Google Play Store or iOS store.  According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the app will not only save the time of the applicants but also will ease the process of applying for the passport. However, for now, the online application service will only be available in certain passport application centres where the live enrollment system exists– DoP Office Narayanhiti and some Nepali Diplomatic Missions abroad. If you live elsewhere, you will have to wait for this service according to the Secretary of DoP, Sankar Das Bairagi.        How does the online process work?  After you complete filling the passport form in the app, you will have to submit the online application. And once the form is submitted, the applicant will receive a personalized bar code. Then, the applicants should contact the DoP or other live enrollment centers with the bar-code for further process.  However, you will still need a recommendation letter from your concerned District.

['New Tech & Gadgets to expect at CES 2017'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['January 4, 2017']",2017-01-04 09:41:24+00:00,"['More than 3,000 tech companies and innovators, including manufacturers, developers and suppliers of consumer technology hardware, content, technology delivery systems and more are headed to Las Vegas for CES 2017 that will start this week.  The 50th CES will officially start from 5th January and will end on 8th January. It is at CES, we can expect to see some futuristic gadgets. So, what new tech and gadgets can we anticipate at CES 2017? Well, pre-show news, whispers and rumors say we will see the glimpse of future technology at CES this year. Let’s look at some of them in this post.  VR and Augmented Reality         2016 was a great year for VR and AR. We saw products like HTC Vive,\xa0Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR. These VR headsets showed the real potential of a VR, the jump from simple VR like Google Cardboard was applaudable.  Read about VR technology here .  There are rumors that we will get to see a wireless HTC Vive at CES 2017. The Chinese company Huawei is also said to release it’s VR sets at CES.  If we do see some VR headsets at CES, we will be seeing some real innovation. We might see VR that can be controlled with our body parts like eyes, feet. For example, FOVE, a VR headset that was crowdfunded at  Kickstarter  with eyes tracking abilities, will be introduced at CES 2017.  Beside VR, AR (Augmented Reality) could also gain some hype at CES 2017. Although AR has been an industry focused tech till now, we could see some companies using  Google’s Project Tango  to bring AR to normal consumers– technologies like Microsoft Hololens, for example.  Drones and Self-Driving Cars   Drones have gained a lot of popularity as a consumer electronics in recent years. Although DJI is still the protagonist of the drone show, we could see some more advanced drones like indoor optimized drones, high-speed drones and drones that can go underwater from other companies at CES 2017.  Similarly, Intel might also be pushing its Aero Compute Board, a board to make your own drone.  Talking about cars, CES 2017 might be a great platform to show autonomous cars to the consumers. After Tesla revolutionized the electric cars, a lot of large Automakers are now working on self-driving cars. However, at this CES, we will just be seeing the demo of the possibilities. We will have to wait for future CESs to see a practical and fully autonomous cars.  Moreover, as self-driving requires a constant Internet connection for checking road signals and conditions, we might see chip manufacturers pushing 5G technology at CES 2017. Overall, CES 2017 will act as a floor for software and hardware companies working towards making fully autonomous cars.  Mobiles   CES 2017 won’t be so special if you are looking forwards to seeing new phones because phone companies usually wait until World Mobile Congress to launch their best products. However, that being said, most of the smartphones companies will be present at CES 2017 for small announcements. Xiaomi is attending the event for the first time so we could expect the Chinese manufacturer highlighting some of its smartphones at the show.  PCs   CES 2017 is said to bring back life to Personal Computers (smartphones have been overshadowing them in recent years)- the Microsoft Surface Studio has shown us that PC are still in the game.  At CES 2017, we might see AMD challenging Intel with the release of AMD Ryzen. Also, Intel will be throwing it’s quad-core Kaby Lake processors in its defense (we saw dual-core Kaby Lake processors in the market last year). This CES will be a battle of processors and GPUs.  Read more about Intel processor guide here  Furthermore, with PC compatible VR headsets, both VR and PC might see a rise with this CES. This is a good news for PC gamers as they could get their VR-ready PCs and laptops under $1000. Also, we might see more on  Project Christine- the Razer’s modular PC tower  at CES 2017.  Advanced Wearables   We have seen wearables in the past. Do you think they are good? Well, you will be surprised to hear that we will be seeing more than wrist wearables at CES 2017. The wearables at CES 2017 will not only be able to count steps and track heart rates (like the wearables we know now) but also be able to take the readings of other body organs.  This might sound like a science fiction but an Israeli company will be introducing  the Tytohome , an FDA-approved device, that can take readings of your heart, lungs, throat, skin, abdomen and other organs’ and send it to your doctor. This means you don’t need to wait in line to see your doctor. This device will revolutionize the Telemedicine.  Additionally, there will be wearables that will charge with your body heat. We will also see some wearables with built-in airbags to prevent from fall injuries.\xa0 Moreover, another interesting wearable we will see is a scarf that will act as a mask. Yes, an air-filtering internet-connected scarf from Wair that has cooling fans, and has an app to monitor your breath!  Besides the health wearables, we might see tech in our clothing too- the world’s first vibrating tight cut jeans might be announced at CES 2017. This jean will allow wearers find directions without having to look at the mobile screen.  TVs   TVs has been the most featured gadget since the very beginning of CES and the norm is going to continue at CES 2017 as well.  We will see four main rivals, Panasonic, LG, Sony and Samsung, battling to show off their technology. LG, Panasonic and Sony will showcase their OLED displays while Samsung will be promoting its QLED (quantum dot) technology. Besides these four companies, we will also see countless other manufacturers.  Most importantly, this CES will be a display of HDR (High Dynamic Range) technology- HDR10, Dolby and BBC’s LHG. The HDR has been in the market for a couple of years. HDR10 technology has gained more popularity than Dolby Vision in the market, but we will have to wait and see which HDR technology wins at CES 2017.  Internet of Things and Smart Homes   Well,  Internet of Things (IoT) is a hot topic . Many manufacturers are working on making all your devices connected to each other by adding sensors and Wifi to almost all the electronic devices. These devices will be used to make your home Smart!  At CES 2017, we will see many smart gadgets, from Fridgecam- a device that checks the stock on your fridge and notifies you to Air Quality sensors for your home and smart thermostats. Additionally, we might also see Google’s Android Things platform for home devices at CES 2017.  The good thing about these smart devices is that you don’t need an expert to install them. You can just buy them at the market and use it without any professional’s guidance. However, the major concern regarding these kinds of devices is security. Because IoT has been an easy target for attackers and had  been used for DDoS attack  frequently. At CES, we will see how companies will cope with the vulnerabilities.  Other Exciting Gadgets at CES 2017  BliTab-  a “iPad” for blinds. This tablet will produce small physical bubbles like Braille above the touchscreen.  Olly Robot-  a robot that adapts to the personality of the users.  Unibot-  a modular robot that changes its function depending on which modules are connected to it.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15877855_1325265157495310_500717152_o.png']
['Rumors Round-Up of Samsung Galaxy S8'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['January 4, 2017']",2017-01-04 02:39:29+00:00,"['Samsung, a tough competitor to both Apple and Google, has become a point of interest to many tech followers worldwide. After the Note 7 fiasco, everyone is eagerly waiting for Samsung’s Next Galaxy, the S8. As the date of S8’s release is getting nearer, rumors are being widespread more than ever. In this post, we’ll be rounding up all its rumors. Let’s found out what we can expect from the Samsung’s next flagship phone.  Samsung’s new AI assistant: Bixby  AI assistance in a phone has become more user-friendly and productive lately. Google’s Assitant is promising and Apple’s Siri doesn’t lie far behind. When it comes to Samsung, the S-Voice is truly the assistant of the past. Samsung will be using a new AI assistance of its own in the next galaxy. The Samsung Galaxy S8 will have the Bixby, a newer replacement to the S-Voice. The voice-guided assistance will be capable of doing things that Siri is doing in the iPhones. It is said to be integrated with Samsung’s app and will be more productive than ever. From the next galaxy, you’ll be able to ask your phone to show the photos you took yesterday or on the beach. Yes, that’s something Apple’s Siri and Google’s AI assistant been doing for a while now. It is an appreciable effort from Samsung to make a better version of its own AI assistant.  A new design language: S8, the first all display phone from Samsung  Mobile phone industry has kind of saturated when it comes to design. Many phones get released every month but they come in the design that we are already familiar with. But, as far as trustable rumors are concerned, Samsung is going with a newer design this time around. Samsung Galaxy S8 could be the first Samsung’s device to go completely bezel-less. Yes, the edge-to-edge design that Samsung introduced with the S6 and followed by S7 was widely accepted. Now, the Samsung is stepping up its game and coming with the phone that will sport all display on the front. Well, that sounds like an interesting phone already.         Dual Cameras in the back: S8, the first Samsung phone with dual cameras  Dual Cameras are becoming the new cool in the mobile industry. Many big names in the mobile industry are releasing phones with dual cameras in the back one after another. Samsung is yet to release one, though. But the trustworthy source says the Galaxy S8 will be the Samsung’s first phone to sport dual cameras in the back. The rumor claims this set of the dual lens will be of 16 Megapixels and 8 Megapixels. Not all dual cameras in the phones work the same way so it is yet to see how Samsung will be making the use of dual cameras in the S8.   Optical Fingerprint Sensing Technology: the very first of its kind  Samsung always adds some new flavors with every release of its flagship. The Note 7 had the retina scanning technology which was something we hadn’t experienced before. So, after the Galaxy S8, Samsung is likely to get rid of its home button and will embed optical fingerprint sensor under the glass. Since it’s going to be an all-screen phone, it was obvious there was no place for a mechanical home button. If I get an edge-to-edge screen at a cost of home button then I’m down with that.   3.5 mm Headphone Jack is Dead: Yes, just like the way apple did  Sources claim that Samsung will be joining the war against the 3.5 headphone jack along with the Apple. Well, I wish if 3.5 mm headphone jack stayed a little longer but it is not us who decides whether to keep it or get rid of it. Yes, with the new Samsung Galaxy S8 you won’t be able to charge your phone and listen to music at the same time unless you buy a pair of BT headphones or a dongle that lets you do both at the same time.   Newer Names and Newer Screen Size: the S8 and the S8 Plus  The new variants of Samsung’s yet-to-be-released flagships will be named the S8 and S8 plus. Yeah, that sounds like a naming scheme inspired from the Apple. These two S8s will come at the screen size of 5.5 inches and 6.2 inches. The plus model obviously being of the bigger screen-size.  Well, these are all the rumors we were talking about. So, what will turn into reality and what will die a rumor is something we can only confirm after the release of the highly anticipated Samsung’s Galaxy S8. The S8 is likely to be announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this February. Are you excited for the next Galaxy??\xa0Feel free to write in comments which rumor you want to turn into reality.']",[]

It is only recently that many phones of different price segments started to offer fingerprint sensors in them. Now, you can buy a phone with fingerprint sensor even under 10K and  Colors  P-50 touch is one of those. We put this phone under different tests to find out if it is worth buying a phone this affordable as someone’s daily driver. In this post, we’ll be sharing our views regarding different aspects of  Colors Pride P-50 touch .  Colors Pride P-50 touch is a good plastic built phone. The design language is okay considering its price tag. The phone is noticeably thick and has kind of raised display.        1  of 4                                                          The phone has a 5 inch IPS LCD display with the resolution of 1280*720 pixels. This display standard has become a common standard for budget phones in Nepal lately. Since it’s a budget phone, you gotta live with the thick bezels, forehead, and chin. To make the best out of this display, you better use it without much of tilting.         Under the hood, the phone is powered by quad-core MT6580 processor clocked at 1.3GHz with ARM Mali400 MP2 GPU. It has a 1 GB RAM and 8 GB built-in storage that can be expanded up to 32GB via microSD card. The performance is satisfactory. Well, it’s a budget phone. So, occasional lags and longer loading time are just obvious. The loudspeaker placed at the rear bottom is loud enough but distortions are there more noticeable than ever.   As far as the cameras are concerned, there is a 8 MP on the back and 5 MP on the front. Well, they are a budget phone’s camera so don’t expect much from them. They just get the job done and for doing video calls at night you might wanna be in a well-lit room. To get decent photos you must be in a well-lit environment or else you’re gonna get photos full of grains. If you’re into taking videos, you just can’t rely on its autofocus, touch-focus is something that you should be using for better results.  Pride P50 Touch Rear Camera samples during Day Light  Pride P50 Touch Front Camera samples during Day Light  The fingerprint sensor on its back is the real head-turner in this phone. I doubted its performance at first. But when I started using it, I was surprised. They are little slower but work accurately even when fingers are placed at odd orientations. The sensor does more than unlocking the phone, you can unlock apps too. Plus, there’s an option to launch four different apps by swiping left, right, up and down in the sensor. Additionally, while using cameras, photos can be taken by tapping on this sensor.        1  of 2                                       Colors PRIDE P-50 touch houses a 2200 mAh battery but the battery doesn’t seem to be much optimized here. In heavy usages, you’ll be getting only a couple of hours of screen on time. Plus, charging is a real pain here. The phone takes much longer to charge as well.   The phone boots on Android 6.0 with Color’s generic UI on top. Yes, you can change the theme but the option is limited to four themes to choose from. There are these soft keys for navigation instead of capacitive one. Plus, you can change the ordering of these soft keys depending on whether you want the back button to the left or right.      Colors Pride P50 Touch User Interface   1  of 7                                                                                        Is it worth buying Colors PRIDE P-50 touch?  To conclude this review, well Pride P-50 touch is one of the cheapest budget phones that is worth considering. But, we would like to get few things straight, if you’re opting for a phone worth Rs. 9,500 don’t expect it to give you the best of everything. Yes, the fingerprint sensor is there, it is a reliable one but is slow. The camera’s autofocus is almost like hit or miss. So manual touch focus is something you should rather be using for better results. The videos happen to be too sharp and color reproductions are far from accurate. The screen isn’t that bright outdoors so you might wanna use it in shades as opposed to direct sunlight. All in all, it’s worth buying if you want a cheap budget phone capable of doing everything to be one’s daily driver.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pride-P50-Touch.jpg']

The date of the events and pre-events are fixed. So, mark your calendar and be ready for being the part of the largest innovative tech fair of Nepal. Locus 2017 is scheduled to run for three days starting from  9th of February, 2017 (2073 Magh 27) .  What is Locus?  Locus is a student-run organization established with a mutual collaboration of students from Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering of Pulchowk Campus. This organization serves as host to organize a national wise technological festival (or technological exhibition) annually in IOE Central Campus, Pulchowk. Contrary to the theoretical teaching approach in our education system, this organization provides the platform to excel and demonstrate the hardware skills, software skills, and skills for logical reasoning. And to unveil potentiality of discovering and inventing, Locus organizes various events and pre-events. This year’s Locus tech-fest is baptized as  Locus 2017 \xa0themed with  Renovating Society .  Pre-events in Locus 2017  As mentioned previously, Locus provides a platform to discover and invent ideas related to technology and to implement them. For this, Locus 2017 is packed with a series of events and pre-events. Some of the finalized events and pre-events are mentioned here. We will keep you updated with any further additions or modifications.        1. Robotics Crash Course  This course has been introduced to enlighten the basic ideas and principles regarding the field of electronics and making them capable of building hardware projects. This course is categorized into two levels. One is beginners’ Robotics Crash Course designed for the rookies and another is an advanced Robotics Crash Course, which is designed for the ones having a sound knowledge of basic theory and principles of electronics. Students from any engineering colleges can book a seat for themselves. The registration fee is Rs. 1000 and the course will last for more than 7 days. Every detail of this pre-event is mentioned on the photo, which is attached herewith.  2. Case Study competition  In this pre-event, any student with a keen interest in any topic/field can perform a research. At the end of the research, he/she is expected to submit a report regarding the topic. Among the submitted reports, the best will be selected and rewarded. However, this competition is only for the students of Pulchowk Campus. The briefing will be done to the students on Poush 21 and the deadline for the submission of case study reports will be then finalized. In order to take part in the competition, Rs. 100 is to be paid for the organizers from each team.  3. Maya Animation Workshop  This is a two-day workshop, where the enthusiasts will be briefed about Maya software and its uses. Further, in this workshop, learners will be taught to create and design animations. This workshop will be on 24th and 25th of Poush.  4. Photoshop + Illustrator Workshop  In this workshop, any students, who are zealous about the Graphics designing, will be enlightened with the knowledge of Photoshop and Illustrator software. The learners will not only be taught about the tools in the software and its uses but also the designing works using such software. Every zealous student is welcomed by Locus for this workshop. However, a pre-registration is required in order to take part in the event. This workshop will be on Poush 26 and 27.  5. Git Workshop  Wikipedia has described Git as a widely used\xa0source\xa0code management system for software development and a distributed\xa0revision control\xa0system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. For the programmers, who are habituated in doing projects individually or in a group of small number, working among a team of many members will be troublesome. If there is not proper division and synchronization of the project, there will be the growth of chaos. To cope such problems, Git is a correct platform. Visualizing this platform as a must for the programmers and software developers, Locus has managed to enlist it among the number of pre-events. Git workshop is scheduled for 26 th  of Poush.  6. +2 Level Quiz  In order to boost the General Knowledge of +2 students, Locus has managed to embed +2 Level Quiz in the list of its pre-events. A team of +2 students from any college can take part in this program. However, a registration is required to be the contestant in the quiz. The registration costs Rs. 2500 per team. The date for the +2 Level Quiz is scheduled on Magh 8.  7. Tech Debates  This is the new pre-event added in the Locus timeline. In this pre-event, participants are expected to perform logical reasoning in the given topic. This will be in a similar pattern to  World Universities Debating Championship\xa0(WUDC)\xa0 following the format of  British Parliamentary Debate . This program will go on for three days starting from 14 th  of Magh. And the mandatory number of participants in the team is two.  \xa0  \xa0  8.

No matter the amount of time of sleep, waking up with such ways mostly invites grogginess in our body. The grogginess remains adhered in our body diminishing our enthusiasm, agility, and productivity. So, in order to solve this problem, a smart eyeshade has been developed.  Naptime  is the device, developed to enhance the quality of sleep and kill the feeling of drowsiness after waking up.  What is Naptime?  Naptime simply is a smart eyeshade with EEG technology. This device is an eye mask, which when worn prevents light from entering your eyes from any angle. The device also endows a set of digital earphone, which plays music from your smartphone music library. Contrary to the normal way of listening music from your smartphone, this device senses the brainwaves and mood, and plays music matching those aspects. The music played from this device lulls you inducing the sleep. So, having this device on, even with a short nap of 10 or 20 minutes, the drowsiness will not come to nudge you.         Construction of Naptime  Naptime consists of three layers. The first layer, which remains in contact and closest to the eye is made up of memory foam. The construction of memory foam employs billions of temperature-sensitive particles. This layer fits well in the upper part of the face and provides comfort to the eyes. The middle layer consists of breathable fabric. The exterior or outer layer of the device is enveloped with the leather finish. The manufacturer has claimed that no animals have been slaughtered to provide the leather finish. According to the manufacturers, high-quality artificial leather is used to provide that leather finish.  How does this smart eyeshade works?  The inner layer of the device also employs a silver fabric. When worn, the silver fabric touches the skin through which the brainwaves are transmitted to the device. The device employs an EEG technology, where the EEG stands for electroencephalogram. The EEG senses the electrical signals from the brain and records it. According to these brain signals, the device will play music from your smartphone, matching your mood and induces the sleep. When the user falls asleep, the device intellectually plays white noise to block the sound from the outside.   This device does not need an external battery source to power it. It gets powered when connected with your Android smartphones or iPhones. However, it requires Naptime app on your phone, which is responsible for playing music corresponding to your mood. The device will figuratively poke you to wake up when you are in a light sleep. Waking up at the time of light sleep will not invite drowsiness in your body. This app also keeps track of the amount of time slept, the time taken to fall asleep and also sketches a sleep cycle curve. This app also provides the score of your sleep reading the frequency of brainwaves and also gives necessary tips to enhance the quality of sleep.  This development itself sound astounding as well as alluring. With so much of people suffering from insomnia and having sleep-deprivation, This device seems to be a cool alternative. However, this device has not yet been released. This device is set to launch in May of 2017.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/naptime.jpg']

As Friday and Saturday were public holidays, the Telecom could not approve its tariff plans ahead of the release. Therefore, subscribers will be using the 4G network in tariff plans of 2G/ 3G service. According to those tariff plans, subscribers with no package deals could use Internet service for Re.1 per MB (without tax). 2G, 3G services allowed users to call at Re.1 per minute during 6 AM – 10 PM. Similarly, calling rates from 10 PM – 6 AM was 55 paisa per minute. 3G video calling in Prepaid and Postpaid SIMs cost Rs 2/min. Whereas, MMS rates were Rs. 1.50 per minute. The latest 4G service will allow users a networking speed of 30-40 MB per second. This will be run on the old tariff rates for the introductory phase.         The service, however, will be made available only in the selected locations of the two valleys. The locations have also not been disclosed yet. All of the customers also might not be able to initiate the service on the first day of the launch as they might have to change their SIM cards. The company has said that it will let all of its SIM distributors in Kathmandu to sell 4G SIM cards soon. Mahendrapul in Pokhara will be responsible for distributing SIM cards in Pokhara.  On October 21, NT had received permission to operate  4G services in the valleys  from January 1. Since then, the company has conducted many tests to establish the 4G network. During these tests, the Telecom found out that, the 4G service was inaccessible in iOS driven devices. The iPhones before iPhone 5 won’t support 4G sim cards. The Nepal Telecom has not entered for such an appeal. And hence iOS users, here, won’t be able to use 4G network.  According to the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), NT can introduce it’s own promotional tariff for a period of three months from the date of the soft launch of the service. NTA granted permission to the Nepal Telecom to release 4G service from the allotted 1,800 MHz frequency. NT has said to use 5 out of 15 MHz to establish a ground for the new 4G service. Both NT and Ncell, a privately owned cell phone service provider, has applied for permission to launch 4G service in Nepal. NTA is said to have been reluctant to grant permission to Ncell due to the ongoing capital gain tax case.  4G network initiated by NT, from set to be on Sunday, will also launch free 4G service for the initial four days. According to this plan, users will be provided 1GB data free each for the first four days. Authorities have said this scheme was initiated to build a foundation for the new service among all the customers. The free service will be on the run, throughout January. However, the users who have once already used the free service won’t be able to use the network for free again.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NTC_Nepal.jpg']
['My City Pulse app: discover the rhythm of your city'],"['Android', 'Apps', 'iOS']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['December 30, 2016']",2016-12-30 14:24:21+00:00,"['With New Year around the corner, there will be a lot of events happening around you. If you are planning to celebrate the New Year, then, obviously, you need to find out where to bash. Luckily, we are living in a tech era; which means you can now discover the best events around you on your smartphone! All you need is  My City Pulse  app (or so they say). This app is available for free for  Android  and  iOS  (for now).  Now, let’s dig into what the app has to offer.  Features of My City Pulse:  First of all, the app is very easy to use. It has three main sections which you can switch around easily. The three sections are Event, Live Map, and Promotion.          EVENT    You can explore events (concerts, parties or music/art festivals) that are happening in\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Kathmandu in this section. If you find an interesting event, you can click it for more details. You can also get directions to the event you like just by clicking “GET DIRECTIONS” button. According to the MyCityPulse, if you log in with your Facebook and click “GET OFFERS” button on any interesting event, you may be eligible for special offers like discount vouchers, free drinks, and free entrance. The comment section on events is quite useful for real customers review.  If you are an organizer, you can post your events on this app by contacting the company.    LIVE MAP    In this section, you can view the exact places where the events are happening on a map. If you turn your GPS on, the map will show the nearest events around you.The events are represented by Pins; and the cool thing is, the pins change color depending on how many people are attending the event. Yellow pin means there are 20 people or less at the event, Green means between 20 to 100 people and Red means there are over a 100 people there. Plus, you can simply click on a pin to get details about the event.    PROMOTION:    You can check this section to find out about the special offers/deals your favorite businesses are offering. As a customer, you can leave a comment about the experiences you had with the promos so that other customers can read the review before they buy. If you are a business, you can contact My City Pulse to promote your business.  \xa0      My City Pulse   1  of 9                                                                                                            \xa0  Additionally, according to the company, they will be adding many other features to this app in the future. The aim of the company is to make this app a local social media platform and a traveler’s app. The app will work as a local guide for international travelers to find entertaining events and best deals for eating, relaxing and shopping in the near future.  However , when I tested this app in beta phase on an android phone, before it was launched officially on 28th December 2017, it had some bugs and guess what? They are still there!  Drawbacks:   The images on the preview thumbnail of the events and promos look weird. The forcefully-fitted images on the thumbnails gave me a bad impression about the app. The images could be made more responsive.  First, the app didn’t notify me to turn on my GPS when I was on the Live Map section. Secondly, even when I turned the GPS on, the app couldn’t locate my current position. It seemed like the GPS was not working on the Live Map.  I had difficulty exploring the map on the Live Map. When I tried to explore the map by swiping left or right, I was taken to another section instead.  The “Get Directions” button on Events and Promotions takes you to another navigation apps ( like Google Maps). This can be a bad thing because sometimes we might not have enough memory on our phone. It would be great if the app could show us the direction from within the app using the Live Map section.  The help section of the app has a topic called “What’s Happening” which is nowhere to be seen on the app. I personally informed them about this on their facebook page, but it is still there. This makes me doubtful about the seriousness of the company towards the app.    In conclusion, this app looks promising for the benefit of local businesses and tourism. However, with so many bugs and the company not showing any effort for fixing them (even when they were informed about the bugs during beta test) make the app a disappointment.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/My-City-Pulse-Cover-Design-for-GadgetByte-Nepal.jpg']

According to LogRhythm ( a security intelligence company that organization like NASA, US Air Force trust), we might see a cyber doomsday in 2017. James Carder, the company’s chief information security officer and vice president said:        “In 2017, we’re going to see it hit big sometime, somewhere.”  Similarly, if the Internet goes down this time, it won’t be just normal users experiencing unavailability of certain online services. Rather, if the whole Internet goes down for 24 hours, experts say, the financial market will collapse.  According to security experts, the DDoS attacks we saw in 2016 were just samples. The hackers were simply shooting missiles into the ocean to test them.\xa0 Therefore, we could expect more serious attacks in 2017. James Carder also said,  “If you can prove that you can take down massive sites and a large chunk of the US internet for a few hours, a 24-hour outage seems pretty easy to do.”  Since most of us depend so much on the Internet these days, not being able to use the Internet for 24 hours might cause a serious panic around the world.

['New Road Mobile Expo Review: A true Disappointment'],['Events in Nepal'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['December 30, 2016']",2016-12-30 05:15:59+00:00,"['Is it 2017 already??                  Today is the second day of New Road Mobile expo.\xa0And we thought of giving a second visit to the expo to explore in detail what a visitor will get and how he or she will feel in the expo. In this visit, we tried acquiring as many details as we could regarding the special offers introduced by different mobile brands present in the expo.  Ncell: Free SIM is the Way?   The entrance is all about the Ncell’s stall and it was the most crowded one. In the expo, anyone purchasing a new phone will be getting a Ncell Sim for free with some free data. The documents that customers need to have to get a free Ncell Sim is the VAT bill of the purchase, the visiting card of the shop with its stamp on the back and the customer’s citizenship card or driving license. However, anyone can purchase four Ncell Sim cards at the price of 100 rupees and each sim will have the balance of 20 rupees.        Leagoo & Zopo: New Brands going Ballastic about Promotion    Samsung: Free Shampoo? What’s the catch?   Then there is the desk of Samsung, which is giving a scratch card for every purchase of a Samsung phone. From any scratch card, the customer may win a shampoo or a 5200 mAh powerbank or a leather bag depending on whether they score\xa0silver or gold or diamond prize after scratching. A person won a 5200mAh power bank right when I was visiting the stall.  Gionee: All about Gift Hampers!  In the expo, Gionee is giving gift hampers on every purchase of Gionee S6s.  Colors: Let’s sell Older Windows Phone.  On every purchase of Colors WIN W10 at NRs. 10,495, you’ll get another Colors WIN W10 for free.   HTC: Let’s watch a movie after buying a phone.  HTC is giving two free tickets for Cine-De Chef on every purchase of HTC mobile from the expo. They are also  running a campaign  where you could win a HTC phone.   CG: The Ring  On every purchase of CG smartphone, CG is giving away a power bank or screen enlarger or phone ring depending on the models of phone you buy.  Oppo: Selfie Stick for an overpriced selfie camera  Similarly, Oppo is giving away selfie sticks to its customers.   Verdict  Many of the gift hampers were retailers specific as well. There isn’t uniformity in the gift-hampers which varied from store-to-store. Talking about my experience in this expo, it was no different than any other expos. It was a frustrating and confusing experience. Nothing looked systematic or managed. There are stalls everywhere, but what they offer is limited. Nothing jaw dropping, no new devices. If you are going to buy the same device, you can find anywhere and at the similar price. Would you go to the expo to buy a phone in the crowd, just for a free Ncell Sim Card?? Well, I let you decide yourself on that.  Honestly speaking, this New Road Mobile Expo is nothing, but a hoax. It has nothing to offer other than the cheap advertisement of new mobile brands to the crowd. All that you’ll find are the stalls of mobile brands handing you the leaflet that you’re gonna throw right away or a\xa0few minutes after. The Expo was no good in any way. I went to the expo with some high hopes but the expo turned it all down. If you have nothing else to do and like walking in the crowd, then only I suggest you go to the expo. Or else, you can skip this expo out of your checklist and invest your valuable time in something else.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/newroad-mobile-mohatsab.jpg']

Following the rumor stream, the new leaks are about the upcoming iPhone 7s or the iPhone8. According to a Japanese blog,  Macotakara , the upcoming model of iPhone will have a vertical camera instead of a horizontal one and will have a couple of new features integrated.  Looking at the history of Apple, the only changes in the ‘s’ model used to be the specs bump, we rarely saw a significant hardware change. But this new change in camera position could mean something different, a different use of dual lens maybe. Leaks also suggest that the new iPhones would come with a size of 5 inches and the plus model would come in the size of 5.8inch. Unlike the 7 models both the new variants will come with a dual camera set up.   As next year (2017), is the 10 th  anniversary of the iPhone, so Apple is preparing something grand for the iPhone 8. Leaks suggest that the Apple has more than 10 iPhone 8 prototypes and the leaked one could be one of them which means he leaks will continue restlessly. Also, the rumors claim, the iPhone will come in an all glass body to support wireless charging and finally remove the home button for on screen buttons and will incorporate an edge to edge OLED display. Apple introduced the Rose Gold(Pink) color and it was an instant hit, now the leaks suggest the Apple will come in a bright red color which might set the trend of Red in 2017.        The next iPhones will launch in September 2017 and it is still a long way there, so we might get a clear idea of the new iPhone when it gets closer to release. But the 10th year anniversary iPhone 8 will sure hold a lot of stake for Apple, for now, let’s keep our finger crossed and hope Apple does everything right this time.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iphone-7a.png']

Gionee has come to limelight with its premium phone M2017 which comes with a massive 7,000mAh battery.  This year has been really innovative with all kinds of IoT-based stuff and AI being integrated into the smartphone. Specs similarly has been better than ever, we’ve seen the best display, best performance, best camera and a lot of things that would make the smartphone experience great but one thing that misses out every time is the battery life which now seems to be coming to a better conclusion with the inclusion of bigger battery and faster charging.  Gionee M2017  clearly by its model name seems to be something we could only expect at 2017 and for now, it’s just the Chinese market that’ll get the taste of this phone. The phone comes with an impressive 5.7-inch dual curved QHD AMOLED display with pixel density of 518ppi. It is running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Amigo UI 3.5 on top and the android update is something we’re skeptical about. Optics wise the phone comes with a dual camera set up with impressive 12MP + 13MP combo, this is certainly a lot of pixels for a single phone. The combination of this lens enables us to get 2x optical zoom and 8x digital zoom.         One downside of Gionee M2017 is its low powered Snapdragon 653 Chipset. To push an AMOLED display and process image from dual lens, Snapdragon 821 would have been perfect. The phone also comes in two variants, one with 128GB storage and 4GB of RAM and another with 256GB storage and 6GB of RAM. The higher variant will also sport a premium Italian Custom Alligator Leatherback. Up front, it comes with a fingerprint sensor and capacitive keys. But most importantly it comes with USB C for charging, data syncing and audio. Yes, no headphone jack!  The main highlight of the phone is the 7,000mAh battery which is a combined package of two 3,500mAh battery. Gionee claims the phone will give 26hours of video playback and standby time of 915 hours which is really impressive. This phone should provide at least 10 hours of screen on time. To juice up the battery, the phone comes with Quick Charge 3.0. And all that battery has added up to its weight and the phone weighs 238grams.   But all these specs doesn’t come cheap, the lower variant of the phone costs $1,010 while the premium version with Italian leather costs $2,446 which is insane! Gionee M2017 were made in limited amount and was made available for pre-booking which as of now has been sold out.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/12272016104001AM_635_gionee_m2017_db.jpeg']

So, the habit of using toilet papers for cleaning phones is being practiced in Japan.  Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus mycoides are the bacterias, which are assumed to be found in phones. The former is infectious if it makes contact with the breached parts of our body. This bacterium invites Skin infections, Food poisoning, Bone and joint infections, and Bacteremia. The later one is generally found on pesticides, which inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi.  Toilet papers for cleaning phones, the title itself sounds hilarious. However, this step is to ensure hygiene in our life. It is believed that a phone carries five times more germs than a toilet seat. And the untiring companionship with our phone has made us vulnerable to the infection. NTT Docomo, a mobile phone operator in Japan is the one to raise this awareness. To ensure this awareness, NTT Docomo has been responsible for the installation of 86 stalls of “toilet papers for cleaning phones” dispensers in the seven restrooms of Narita International Airport.

It started with the death of Project Ara – Google’s Modular Smartphone at the very beginning. Then Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 7 in the third quarter of this year. Then it was recalled and replaced but again it was recalled shortly. This is how Note 7 died forever. Google killed the Nexus line-up and went with the Pixel phones instead. OnePlus stopped manufacturing OnePlus 3 after few months from its release and came up with OnePlus 3T instead. And when the year was almost ending, Cyanogen Inc. shuts down the Cyanogen OS and its services forever. It really is a tragic moment to see the most customizable version of Android being killed.  But for those who were following news about Cyanogen Inc. for a little while, it wasn’t a surprise. It started with the staff layoff then was followed by the exit of its CEO as well as the co-founder. The end of Cyanogen Inc. was reasonable since OEMs decided to not go against the Google’s Android eco-system. Very few OEMs went with the Cyanogen OS and many discontinued soon after. For Instance, One Plus did go with the Cyanogen OS for the OnePlus One but later went with its own Oxygen OS for later phones.  For those wondering what will be the impact of this shutting down of Cyanogen OS and its services, if you’re using a phone powered by Cyanogen OS then you won’t be getting future updates. Yu Yureka, OnePlus One or ZUK Z1 are the widely sold phones running on Cyanogen OS. However, Cyanogen Inc. will be making the open source project and source code available for those who want to build CyanogenMod on their own.

The increase in functionality and technological advancement of mobile phones have certainly made our life easier. Also, this has made mobile phones so popular, even in a developing country like ours. According to  MPIA  (Mobile Phones Importers Association), the business of mobile phones is the third most valuable commodity in Nepal.  Furthermore, with so many people changing their mobile set every year, it is no surprise that mobile business is just behind Petroleum and Iron in Nepal in terms of the transaction. According to sources, the mobile phone sector sees an annual growth of about 40 percent. And, it is estimated that there will be a transaction of over 36 billion rupees in this fiscal year.        With so much mobile being transacted yearly, the business of mobile phone has certainly helped a lot in the economic development of Nepal. However, there are still some challenges like growing gray market. Similarly, in my personal opinion, the taxes on mobile phones, are also too high. Since communication is a basic need these days, don’t you guys think our government should lower tax on the mobile phones?

This year we got the taste of edge to edge display and dual edge display (Galaxy Note 7) which didn’t last very long to relish. Huawei’s flagship phones always had the industrial design which we commonly find on most of the smartphones which are really not that intriguing. But with the P10, Huawei seems to be taking the step in the right direction as the new leaks suggest the phone will be coming with a dual edge display like the Huawei’s own Mate 9(Porsche Edition) with some additional improvements.  As Samsung adopted the dual curved edge display earlier, most of the phone that comes with the same aesthetics are likely to be a Samsung Lookalike and this is true for the P10. It looks exactly like the Note 7 and Huawei branding is the only thing that makes us acknowledge it’s a P10. It comes with a 5.5inch (2560 x 1440 pixels)Quad HD display which is a bump from the 5.2-inch display in the Huawei P9. Huawei is also adding few new features to go along with the Edge display to make it more functional.         Huawei has also shifted the fingerprint sensor from the back to the front of the phone which will act as a Home Button which is a welcome change. But in the renders, there is also a fingerprint sensor on the back which is really confusing. Despite the looks, Huawei has stuck with their roots providing the Dual Camera setup most probably for the bokeh effect or they might come up with something interesting. Leaked benchmarks showed the rear camera is of 12MP and the front is 8MP which is exactly like the  Huawei P9 . The leaks suggest the phone will also come with Fast Wireless Charging feature which will be the first for Huawei.  P10 is supposedly powered by Kirin 960 processor used in  Mate 9  and comes with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM based on storage of 64GB or 128GB respectively. It will also be running on latest version of EMUI on top of Android Nougat. And to our surprise, P10 will also come in a flat version, which would be equivalent of S7 for the S7 Edge. We saw the launch of Huawei \xa0P9 in April this year so we can expect the P10 to launch around the similar time in 2017. We expect the price of P10 to be around $800 considering its top tier\xa0specs and pricing of other flagships.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Huawei-P10-render.jpg']

['Your computer is used for malicious activities (botnet)!'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['December 23, 2016']",2016-12-23 07:02:23+00:00,"['I wrote about  DDoS attack  a few days ago. And, the power of a DDoS attack is directly proportional to the number of Botnets (compromised systems) that attackers have access to. So, it is really necessary that we find out if  our devices are controlled by hackers . Also, hackers may have been stealing your private information by making you their slave.\xa0 In this article, we will talk about what botnet is, why it is dangerous and how to stay safe.  What is a Botnet?  In simple terms, a network of the infected devices is called a botnet. These infected devices can communicate with each other without the knowledge of the device owner. For example, when a malware(virus) infects your computer, the malware can send information about you to other infected computers; and you won’t have a clue. Then, these infected computers, called as “bot”, connect with each other to form a botnet.  Once a botnet is formed, the malware maker (hacker) can remotely control all the devices in the network. Since the device owners won’t know about the activities of their computer (once they are in a botnet), devices in the botnet are sometimes referred as zombie computers.        How is a botnet created?  First of all, an attacker creates or buys exploit kit. Then, with the help of the tools, they infect your computer with a malware. After that, the malware does all the job– the malware starts connecting with other malware on other infected devices by logging to command-and-control (C&C) server. This way, based on the quality and capability of the bot (malware), the bot can create a large or a small botnet. A famous bot these days is Mirai which targets  IoT devices .  Why is botnet dangerous?  Because, first of all, anyone with a little computer knowledge can  create a botnet in 15 minutes . And, botnets can be used for following malicious activities.   The master of a botnet can use the network to send millions of spam emails in seconds.  Botnets are an essential part of making a strong DDoS attack– making websites unavailable by overflooding the website with fake traffic.  Steal the credentials (username, password) of the infected computer– if your computer is a part of a botnet, your private data is under threat.  Use the resources of infected devices for Brute-force attacks (for cracking passwords).   Since the botnets are like robot warriors that can spread like a virus, hackers can use if for their deeds and not even get caught. So, we, device owners, must take safety measures to prevent our devices from being infected (if you are not already infected).  Signs that your computer may be already infected:   Your computer is becoming slower.  You get weird error messages on your computer.  Your computer crashes more often.  Task Manager shows various unidentified programs running.  Ads are displayed even when you are not running a browser.  You see posts that you didn’t post on your social media timeline.  Your email contacts receive emails from you that you didn’t send.  You cannot download/run antivirus softwares.  Your computer’s fan seems to be kicking in even when the system is idle.   How to prevent your computer from being a zombie?   Always check for services running on your computer using Task Manager. If you see any unwanted or suspicious services that are running, disable them.  Update your anti-virus regularly (if you are using one).  Change the password of your router and other devices regularly.  Some malware can hide from normal anti-virus software, so download and run a rootkit detection tool to be sure.  Do not download or click pop-ups ads. Ignore them!  When you are installing a software, be sure to check if other Softwares are also being installed with it.  Do not open E-mail attachments from unknown sources.  If you are already infected, it is better to wipe your computer. And then scan your device with anti-virus software.  Finally, monitor your internet activity using Firewall.   STAY SAFE!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/botnet.jpg']

Things will be simpler and complex at the same time with its wide application in near future.  Starting with what exactly is IoT, it is a concept of connecting any and every device to the internet. Then we can easily operate them right from our phones or computer. Let’s say, when your\xa0home appliance has IoT you can turn them on or off from literally anywhere provided that both you and your appliance have the internet connection. You can check their status and access their data\xa0as well. IoT when combined with AI, we are going to be in the future that we’ve been thinking about since long.  When devices will have IoT, they can communicate with other devices as well just like any two people with internet would do. With the installation of devices with IoT, any home would be a smart home. All the devices can be automated, monitored and controlled right from a phone. You could make your coffee maker brew\xa0coffee for you right from your bed after you wake up.        Different industries are working on AI and IoT and once they make it happen to the commercial level, life is gonna be much simpler by then. The fridge will itself add milk to your grocery list on your phone when you’ll run out of it. The car will look at your schedule on the phone and take you to your first destination through shortest route. For Instance, if your printer at work has IoT and AI and it happens to run low on ink. Then, it will by itself order a toner refill kits. Everything, literally everything will get smarter and productive.  If you remember it correctly, I told you things will just not get simpler but will get more complex as well after IoT will be widely accepted. There will be billions of devices connected to the internet. They’ll add huge data to the servers every second. Plus, the bandwidth of Internet, one needs to have at home or work will exceed exponentially. Not only that, the digital threat will increase for sure. Can you imagine someone might be able to hack into your system through the bread toaster in your kitchen.  Big names in Tech Industry including Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others are doing everything they can to make IoT and AI available to everyone. Recently, Google introduced its new OS for IoT, namely  Android Things . Actually, Google didn’t build something new but it’s a rebranding of its older version of OS for IoT named “Brillo”. There are already many other OS for IoT. This one by Google can be expected to be a good hit if the electronics manufacturers worldwide start working with it. Well, we can be hopeful for IoT to turn into reality in days to come. But still, how sooner or later it will take for us to enjoy IoT and AI, is something we can’t say at the moment. How excited or laid-back are you regarding the IoT? What device in your home/work you want to have IoT and why? Share with us in the comments.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iot-hack.png']

Gionee for the first time in Nepal has initiated a door to door delivery of the smartphones that you leave in the authorized service center for repair. However, for the delivery service, you’ll have to pay additional Rs.130 and your phone will be at your doorsteps within 3hours. Note that this charge is just for one way delivery. This is a really convenient service for those who are super busy or someone who don’t want to bother back and forth from the service center.   And if your smartphone suffers from the same problem even after maintenance, Gionee will collect the phone from your doors at zero cost. Currently, the service is available in Kathmandu Valley and t his is a really great start for after sales service in Nepal which I hope many will find useful.

But, since 2016 is almost over and we see no sign of any release, we can expect Nokia smartphones in the market in 2017.\xa0 The phones might probably be launched at  Mobile World Congress 2017  because  HMD Global  is taking part in the event. The event will start on 27th February 2017.  So, what kind of phones can we expect from Nokia? Well, according to rumors, we might see three phones from Nokia: two variants of a mid-range phone(D1C) and one flagship phone P1.  There is no hint about the specs and design of Nokia’s flagship phone P1. However, recently few images of Nokia smartphones were leaked in China. These leaked images didn’t look like any of the old Nokia phones so they could be the new Android featured Nokia. Here are the images:            Nokia Android Leaked   1  of 5                                                                    Also, few rendered images of Nokia smartphone were also leaked in China which are rumored to be the two variants of  Nokia D1C .

Price of Nokia D1C in Nepal  The price of mid-range phone Nokia D1C\xa0 could be around $200 in the USA. We can expect the price to be little higher in Nepal, looking at the trend of other smartphones’ price (the price difference of smartphones in Nepal and India is ridiculous).  For now, all we can do is patiently wait until February.

['HTC is announcing something big on Jan 12'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['December 21, 2016']",2016-12-21 07:20:44+00:00,"['HTC, one of the well-known mobile manufacturer headquartered at Taiwan, lost the limelight for a little while with the release of One M8. But, it didn’t take long to get back as a tough competitor to Samsung and Apple with the\xa0release of HTC 10 on April this year. I don’t know if you’ve already started making plans for the\xa0first month of coming new year but HTC has made a solid plan to make its big announcement early next year. It has sent a press event invitation of Jan. 12 to all major tech reviewers worldwide.  HTC, the backstage player in the making of Google Pixel, is doing well in both mobile and VR industry lately. HTC 11 rumors might be turning into reality on Jan. 12. The press invitation doesn’t signify much other than the date itself. So, it is still hard to tell what exactly HTC is planning to reveal in the second week of the first month of 2017.  By taking a closer look at the press invitation picture, there is a blue background and it is written “for u” along with the date. I think it’s going to announce either a new VR Headset or the HTC 11 codenamed “HTC Ocean” which might be coming in a regular color of blue along with other color options for sure. HTC’s new headset if revealed might be coming without buttons. Yes, “no” physical buttons at all. It’s going to be a new change and many might criticize that. But, I personally would love to have a phone without buttons if it’s OS is optimized that way. Rumors are, the next HTC sense UI will be optimized that way, working mainly on voice commands and gestures.        For now, all we can do is do a blind guess on HTC’s next flagship phone being released on Jan. 12. But, we’ve to wait to see if it’s really a phone or VR or a drone (less likely).

It had built a device that appeared perfect in every department.\xa0 Most people agreed that it was 2016’s best device. But all ended with an anticlimax, that is the fire and explosion fiasco. Samsung had to recall all devices it had sold, and then completely stop the production and distribution of the device.     Read More:  Samsung stops production of the Galaxy Note 7  Read More:  Replacement Note 7 catches fire  Read More:  Replaced Samsung Galaxy Note 7 catches fire in an airplane        Read More:  Samsung confirms reports about Note 7 exploding; Recalls all devices     A Korean News agency,  The Investor , has reported that Samsung knows the reason why Note 7 caught fire. The company had assured to explain the root cause of the Galaxy Note 7 explosion by the end of 2016 but so far the company has chosen to stay silent on the matter.  Few people had released their own theory on the matter. Some said that it was because of the slim phone and the pressurized poles of the battery, while others blamed the battery itself.  No one has any idea what might be the actual cause, but one can assume that it has something to do with the engineering department.  The report has claimed that Samsung has shared its findings with third-party laboratories such as the UL and Korea Testing Laboratory.  Mashable contacted Samsung Electronics North America and a company spokesperson said:  “While we have been conducting our own investigation, we have also been working together with independent third-party experts to re-visit every step of our engineering, manufacturing, and quality control processes. The investigations have been thorough and will take time, and we believe it would be premature to speculate at this point until all investigations are complete. Once the analysis is complete, we will communicate our findings transparently, definitively and quickly.”  So, when the time comes Samsung might release the reports, but we don’t know when exactly.  Samsung is currently concentrating on making its next flagship, the Galaxy S8 a success.

['Oops and Wows in Smartphone Technology (2016 Edition)'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['December 21, 2016']",2016-12-21 06:14:37+00:00,"['Every setting sun is bringing us a day closer to 2017. As 2016 is coming to an end, we decided to make a flashback to review the year. \xa0And here we will be discussing the oops and wows in smartphone technology, we encountered so far in 2016.  Oops of 2016  1. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 burst  Though not of much change in its signature design, Samsung brought its flagship device packed with enticing features like Iris Scanner and an enhanced camera. The initial impression of the device has blown everyone’s mind. The device not only blew people’s minds but also ended up getting itself blown up. Samsung blamed the battery for the explosion and called out the devices for the battery replacement. However, the battery replacement idea did not turn out to be a sustainable solution. The series of explosions did not stop even after the battery replacement. Hence, the manufacturers fall under the obligation to call back all the devices and to discontinue the sales and shipments.         2. Removal of 3.5mm headphone jack in iPhone 7 and 7 Plus  With the introduction of Earpods with the lightning connector, apple decided to cut the journey with 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple faced controversy for this decision; however, Apple put forward the word “courage” as an answer. \xa0Apple publicizes this tantrum as a revolution in audio technology, however, there was nothing much of change to called it a revolution. The only change Earpods got was the connecting jack, though Apple levied a whopping amount of $29.50 for it.  Photo credits: theweek.co.uk  Surprisingly courage is not the answer why Apple kill 3.5mm headphone jack. One of the reasons why headphone jack departed from Apple is that the lightning port is proprietary to Apple. So if a third party makes that accessory, they have to pay for it. It is a direct revenue stream for Apple. Falling under this greed, Apple kills 3.5mm headphone jack from iPhone 7 and 7 plus which have made the users inconvenient to listen to music through the Earpods while charging; as the charger and Earpods use the same slot.  3. Death of Blackberry  Formerly known as Research in Motion (RIM), Blackberry Limited was the first smartphone vendor in the world, specializing in secure communications and mobile productivity. Until 2013, Blackberry had a dominant position in smartphone market share. However, with the peaking of consumers’ craze in Android phones and iPhones, Blackberry devices were slowly swept from the race.   Traditionally, Blackberry devices were relying on Blackberry OS developed by Blackberry Limited. To keep its winning streaks on, BlackBerry decided to get rid of its obsolete OS. So in 2013, Blackberry introduced\xa0BlackBerry 10, a major revamp of the platform based on\xa0QNX\xa0operating system.\xa0With BB10 as OS, Blackberry released\xa0BlackBerry Z10, BlackBerry Q10,\xa0BlackBerry Classic,\xa0BlackBerry Passport, and the\xa0BlackBerry Leap. However, in the Android and iOS dominated smartphone community, BB10 does not turn out to bring an acute taste. In 2015, BlackBerry re-focused its business strategy and began to release Android-based smartphones, beginning with the\xa0BlackBerry Priv\xa0slider and then the\xa0BlackBerry DTEK50. Though having Android OS on its system, Blackberry failed to entice the consumer. So being fed up with the futile attempts, on September 28, 2016, Blackberry announced it would cease designing its own phones in favor of outsourcing to partners.  4. Scam of the cheapest phone  Ringing Bells Company announced Freedom 251 as the cheapest phone costing a mere amount of $3.64 (Indian Rs. 251) in February 2016. The news put everyone in astonishment. When even the low-end devices are costing the price of 50$ and above, the $3.64 announcement sounded fishy. At the end, Freedom 251 turned out to be a scam. The initially marketed Freedom 251 turned out to be Adkom Ikon 4, which costs a price around $55. Actually, the device was found in disguise with the application of whitener on the Adcom logo.   As Adkom device exposed under the veil of Freedom 251, Sanjeev Bhatia, founder and Chairman of Adcom, was found saying in a statement. “To clear the air, I would like to underline a few facts pertaining to case, as this scam exhibits the potential of maligning our brand name Adcom, which is our trademark since 2001.”  The price issue of the device brought a lot of suspicions since the amount of the device mentioned was sufficient just to buy the charger. Ringing Bells also suffered from the investigations as the Noida Police registered a FIR on them. The Chinese manufacturer Adkom does not make an abrupt legal move though they mentioned their unawareness about the use of their brand and product by the Ringing Bells.  Wows in 2016  1.  Huawei P8 Lite Saved Man’s Life  Is not it great if your smartphone lets you communicate with people, listen to music, surf internet, take photos and even save your life? This could be everyone’s dream and this dream came out to be true in 2016. The device, which took the bullet and saved its owner’s life is Huawei P8 Lite. Huawei P8 Lite is the predecessor to the  P9 Lite , which received a price drop in Nepal a few days back.   The lucky person, whose smartphone acted as a bulletproof shield is 41 years aged, Siraaj Abrahams. The South Africa inhabitant Seeraj said that robbers shot him and stole $20 he had with him. After the shot of the bullet, he fainted. According to the report, the bullet caused his heart to pause for a moment but he pulled himself from the mouth of death. After the incident, he received P9 Lite as a replacement for its prior phone from the Huawei. Moreover, the Managing director of Huawei’s Sub-Saharan Africa region took Siraaj and his family out for a lunch. The company has also offered a free VIP entry to Siraaj for all the home matches of the Ajax Cape Town football team, the team sponsored by Huawei.  2. Trend of Dual camera  Sometimes greater quantity offers a better quality and just like that having a dual camera in a smartphone ensures a greater quality in photography. The dual camera started in smartphones with the arrival of LG Optimus 3D and HTC Evo 3D in 2011. However, dual camera in these devices was brought with a sole purpose to capture 3D images or 3D videos. The trend of the dual camera for an enhanced photography started since February 2016 with the arrival of LG G5. In G5, there is a main 16 MP sensor and a second 8 MP sensor. The information of these two sensors does not combine to create effects in photos. The dual camera approach in LG G5 was for a straight shooting. The 16-megapixel camera offers regular photos, but the second lens is wide-angle.   Huawei P9 turned out to be the second in the trend of the dual camera for enhanced photography. However, it ended up being the pioneer for its dual camera concept. In P9, between the two lenses, one is for monochrome, another is for RGB colors, and the merging algorithm equipped in the phone intelligently merges the colors from the RGB sensor and the details of the monochrome sensor.  The\xa0Apple iPhone 7\xa0Plus also features two cameras on the rear, both of 12-megapixels. Both of the cameras offer optical image stabilization, however, with different focal lengths. The first camera offers 23mm zoom, which is sort of wide but not super wide like LG, but wider than the old iPhone camera. With these devices, the trend of the dual camera started. Following one of the above concepts, many smartphone manufacturers are toiling to furnish dual camera in their device too. As far as the continuity of this trend in coming days, there is more yet to see.  3. Official announcement of Nokia to come back  When Google released Android OS in 2008, others smartphone manufacturers started releasing their products with Android OS on their system (except for iPhones). However, at first, Nokia did not cut the journey with Symbian OS. But sometimes later it made a leap to Windows OS and started producing windows phone. Despite the trend, Nokia decided to be persistent with Windows phones. However, the persistence does not pay off. And finally, Nokia became obliged to bend the knees. Nokia has now decided to bring devices with Android OS on their system. For now, lets not dig into the rumored specs of the devices. The officials have already declared about the announcement of the device at MWC 2017, which will be in February. \xa0So all we have to do now is waiting.   4. Midrange phones becoming more stronger  It takes a lot of courage to buy a flagship model since every brand releases their masterpiece packing with one or more features that lure our eye. Getting an upgrade from one flagship to another definitely, blows one’s wallet. And such flagship model gets obsolete as another device comes to surpass its specs. So, smartphones manufacturer focused on bringing mid-range phones packing with alluring specs and making economical enough to save the puncture in your wallet. As this trend continued, 2016 turned out to be a great year for mid-range phones.   5. Modular phones of LG and Motorola  The modular smartphone is a concept introduced to reduce electronic waste, lower repair costs and increase user comfort. In modular phones, the different components of the phone can be replaced or upgraded in modular design. Though Google suspended the Project ARA, LG and Motorola kept the spirits of modular smartphones alive. Following the trails of modular phones, LG G5 and Motorola Moto Z Droid came into the limelight in 2016.   6. Google Tango phone  With the collaboration with Lenovo, Google brought up its Tango phone and Lenovo phab 2 pro presented itself as a first Tango-enabled smartphone. Basically, Tango is a\xa0technology platform\xa0developed and authored by\xa0Google.\xa0With the use of computer vision,\xa0Tango enables mobile devices, such as\xa0smartphones\xa0and\xa0tablets to detect their\xa0position\xa0relative to the world around them without using\xa0GPS\xa0or other external signals. With this platform, developers can create user experiences that include indoor navigation,\xa03D\xa0mapping, physical space measurement, environmental recognition,\xa0augmented reality, and windows into a\xa0virtual world.   7. 6 GB RAM in a smartphone  Apple’s iPhone and Samsung devices have dominated the smartphone market share and these manufacturers are renowned for their flagship devices. When the two biggest smartphone giants are providing 3 GB (iPhone 7 plus) and 4 GB (Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) of RAM, another smartphone came ahead of them to surpass this feature. In 2016, the Chinese company OnePlus brought its flagship device OnePlus 3 (later came as 3T) with a whopping 6GB of RAM. As smartphone has been a multipurpose device, this amount of RAM will ensure a lag-less performance. If other manufacturers follow this trend, we will never have to worry about the phone lags anymore.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/oops-and-wow.png']

The phone features a premium look and feel, full HD display, and an 8MP selfie-centric camera. But, like with all the smartphone reviews, the question is if the phone is worth all your money? We review to find out.  DESIGN  The Gionee S6s has a full metal jacket with a curved body. Comparing with the existing midrange phones like Huawei GR5 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, the Gionee S6s feel more premium and well built. It weighs satisfactory at 166gms and measures just 8.3mm in thickness. It offers capacitive buttons with haptic feedback, but are not backlit. The curved body offers better handling and doesn’t feel\xa0uncomfortable even after continuous use.        1  of 4                                                          DISPLAY  The Gionee S6s sports a 5.5-inch 1080P display with gorilla glass 3 protection. Unlike the predecessor Gionee S6 that comes equipped with AMOLED display, the Gionee S6s houses an IPS LCD panel. It’s necessary not a bad thing as the IPS LCD panel offers true color reproduction and excellent viewing angles. However, i would have liked even more if the display was AMOLED since I like oversaturated colors. The display is also slightly dim with average sunlight legibility but gets the job done most of the time.         SOFTWARE  The Gionee S6s is currently running on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with\xa0Amigo OS 3.1 layered on top. I am not a big fan of Amigo OS since I am more of a stock android user. The Amigo UI lacks App drawer\xa0and is difficult to manage apps on the home screen. The quick access panel can be accessed by swiping from down to up which is awkward\xa0and eccentric for an android user.   The UI is heavily customized with lots of bloatware which results in a lot of RAM consumption. Even without any apps open, the UI consumes around 1GB of RAM.  HARDWARE  The Gionee S6s is powered by a 1.3Ghz Octacore Mediatek Processor (MT6735 SoC) with 3GB of RAM. The MT6573 SoC is a decent performer for browsing, navigating, chatting, etc. However, we are looking at a 64bit Cortex A53 processor cores and Mali T720 GPU which doesn’t live upto the expectation while playing high-end games and heavy multitasking.   The phone feels warm on the back after using for more than 30 mins, but its nothing to get worried about. It doesn’t have any overheating issue to get worried about, but the phone does reach above 50 degrees while playing high-end games and it’s unplayable afterwards.  The 3GB of RAM is a welcome presence. However, unoptimised software means it consumes around half of the RAM without doing anything. The phone comes with 32GB of ROM and if that’s not enough a microSD slot with which you can expand the storage for upto 256GB.  CAMERA  The Gionee S6s features a 13MP rear camera with\xa0f/2.0 aperture lens, phase detection autofocus, and LED flash. During daylight, the photos comes out decent at first impression, but there is nothing to write home about. The color reproduction is inaccurate and the photos lack in details while you zoom in. Dynamic range is poor considering the price tag and HDR mode doesn’t do any miracle at all. The low light photography is mediocre with lots of noise.   The 8MP front camera is the phone’s biggest asset. It is easily on of the best front facing cameras\xa0I’ve ever tested and goes even head to head with flagship handsets like Galaxy S7. Also, the built-in high CRI flash offers a level of low-light usability that most rivals cannot match.   FINGERPRINT  The fingerprint scanner of the Gionee S6s is located on the back and works well. It’s accurate and fast and it’s better than Xiaomi’s redmi Note 3, but not as good as Huawei GR5.  CONNECTIVITY:  The Gionee S6s features a dual SIM slot with 4G VOLTE support, however, these are a hybrid SIM slot which means you can either insert 2 SIM card or a SIM card and a microSD card. The call quality is good thanks to an active noise cancellation with dedicated mic, but \xa0despite that it’s not as good as flagship phones.\xa0Other connectivity option includes WiFi b/g/n (no dual band, ac), GPS, Bluetooth, and FM Radio.  BATTERY:  The Gionee S6s has a sizeable 3150mAh battery which will easily make it through a day if you use it for two hours each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback. However, if you are a heavy user, you need to charge the phone twice a day. Speaking of charging, it lacks quick charge support and will take around 2-3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%. Overall, the Gionee S6s has an average battery life with 3.5 hours of onscreen time, but it has a good standby time.  CONCLUSION:  This year’s S6s is easily Gionee’s best Android smartphone to date. It combines attractive looks, excellent build quality, superb front camera, and Android Marshmallow out-of-the-box to go with an attractive price tag of Rs. 25,999. Having said that, you will compromise in 3 areas: performance, rear camera, and fast charging.   If Rs. 26,000 is all you can spend on a smartphone, and looking for a big display, excellent front camera, and premium looks, \xa0I believe that you will be hard-pressed to find a better option for your money than the Gionee S6s. However, let’s also look around to see what other phones can one get for the money Gionee is asking for the S6s. Here are some of the notable alternatives to the device:    Huawei GR5   Priced at Rs. 24,500, the Huawei GR5 offers a better rear camera, more powerful chipset in Snapdragon 616, however, it’s 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM is no match for the 3GB/32GB storage of the Gionee S6s.   2.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro  Priced at Rs. 25,499, the Redmi Note 3 Pro offers excellent performance with Snapdragon 650 Soc onboard. It also offers a good 16MP rear camera and a huge 4100mAh battery.   3.  Meizu M3 Note  Priced at Rs.\xa024,995, the Meizu M3 Note offers slightly upgraded hardware specs like Helio P10 SoC and 4100mAh battery. However, the 8MP front snapper of Gionee S6s is twice as good as the 5MP front snapper found on the M3 Note.']",[]

So from the looks of it, to create a separate market for tablets, manufacturers are leveling up the screen size and the Samsung’s Galaxy View with 18.4-inch display makes it\xa0pretty much clear.   The LG Gpad III 10.1 sports a full HD panel with the resolution of 1920*1200(224ppi) which is idle for multimedia consumption. It is powered by an octacore Snapdragon 617 clocked at 1.5Ghz which is coupled with 2GB of RAM. The tablet also comes with 32GB of onboard storage and supports expandable storage up to 2TB!         The phablet also has 4G support just so you can talk on your massive tablet (something which you shouldn’t do in public). It also comes with 5MP front and rear camera which could be helpful for video calls. Gpad III 10.1 also comes with a kickstand and can be adjusted 70 degrees for comfortable use and viewing.\xa0 Connectivity wise it comes with 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS and USB C for charging and data syncing.  \xa0It measures 256.2 x 167.9 x 6.7 mm and weighs 510grams. It is backed up by a decent 6,000mAh battery.\xa0 GPad III 10.1 is based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and is running TimeSquare UX which helps the tablet to be used as a clock, calendar or digital frame.   Really the use of tablets for general users seems to be vague. No one will buy a $350 tablet and use it as a desk clock. The market for tablets is really small, for my use, I may use it as a screen for my DSLR or Teleprompter or maybe as a second monitor but there’s not a whole lot of use of giant tablets for general users. Early 2017, another variant of Gpad III will be launched with a stylus then it might be a useful tool for artists and creators.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lg-g-pad-iii-10-1-hero-leak.jpg']
['DDoS attack and measures to Fight DDoS attack'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['December 19, 2016']",2016-12-19 11:18:00+00:00,"['White hats are in an ongoing battle with black hats for protecting the Internet from DDoS attacks. According to  Abhor Network , more than 2000 daily DDoS attacks are observed worldwide.  In 2016, we saw the  largest DDoS attack till date on Dyn (a DNS provider) . During the attack, Dyn’s servers were loaded with more than\xa0 1.2 Tbps of data which crashed the company’s servers.  This attack  caused major websites like Twitter, Amazon, Reddit, and Netflix to go down. The attack was carried out  using IoT devices infected by Mirai  malware; which means the attacker might have used your routers, Smart TVs, mobiles, computers and IP cameras to do the DDoS attack.  Since the attackers have started using your Internet-connected devices to launch dangerous attacks (without your knowledge) against\xa0 Banks,  Telecom , and Media (that speak against some political agendas), it is about time we(users) become aware of DDoS.        What is DDoS Attack?  DDoS  is  Distributed Denial of Service  attack. In this attack, hackers use compromised systems (called  botnets ) to make online services unavailable to clients. During the attack, the attacker simply overfloods the service provider’s servers with fake traffics from multiple sources (botnets). This causes the servers to crash. Thus, the intended audience are deprived of the services.  In simple words, DDoS attack is like window shoppers swarming your business denying genuine customers from getting your service.  DDoS Attack  Symptoms of DDoS Attack:  According to Wikipedia, the  United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team  (US-CERT) has identified  symptoms of a denial-of-service attack  to include:   unusually slow network performance (opening files or accessing web sites)  unavailability of a particular website  inability to access any website  a dramatic increase in the number of spam emails received (this type of DoS attack is considered an e-mail bomb).   Additional symptoms may include:   disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection  long-term denial of access to the web or any internet services.   Why is DDoS attack so dangerous?   A large-scale attack can affect Internet connectivity of entire geographical regions.  Anyone can buy a week of\xa0 DDoS attack at just $150 in the black market.  Source:\xa0 Trendmicro Research  There can be millions of Botnets since many devices these days are connected to the Internet. This makes the attack more dangerous.  There are more than  2000 attacks per day .  Small businesses are an easy target because it is cheap and easy to attack services that don’t have DDoS countermeasures.   How to Fight DDoS attack:   Be prepared by recognizing the symptoms of a DDoS attack.  Get extra bandwidth for your website. This will give you time to fight the DDoS without your service going down.  Monitor your website traffic regularly. Use Web Analytics tools.  If you think you are under attack, contact your ISP or Host Provider.  Use DDoS mitigation specialist companies if you can afford.   In conclusion, spread the words about DDoS attack to everyone you know who owns or wish to own a website. Also, prevent your devices from being compromised– I will write about it on next post. For now, let’s fight DDoS attacks together.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ddos.png']

It packs tons of features making the Android experience amazing (as if it wasn’t already!). Only a few devices have received the nougat update, though, which is a bummer since Nougat has so much to offer.  Read More:  Top Android 7.0 Nougat features  One of the major features of Android Nougat has to be the split-screen support. Samsung’s and LG’s flagship device users have known this feature for quite some time, though. Browsing through Facebook while watching a YouTube video or reading an article on Gadgetbyte Nepal while going through your Instagram feed does sound fun.        I know we can install Custom ROMs and get this feature, but not everyone likes Custom ROMs (me included). So today, I will be explaining an easy way to get the Multi-window mode in your  Marshmallow running devices . For this mode to work,  you will have to root your Android phone .  PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WON’T BE RESPONSIBLE IF YOUR DEVICE GETS BRICKED WHEN YOU ROOT IT.  Here are some requirements to enable multi-window mode on Android:   rooted device running on Android 6.0.x Marshmallow  BuildProp Editor app from Google play store   Download BuildProp Editor here  Now, follow these instructions carefully and you’ll be good to go.   Open the newly installed  BuildProp Editor  app and grant it root access. The root access pop-up appeared on my device after a little while so have some patience. (Note that you will  HAVE  to give the app root access.)  Tap the search icon on top and search  ‘ro.build.type’ .  Select  the ro.build.type command.  Change the value from  user  to\xa0 userdebug  Tap save.  Now  reboot  your device.  After the device restarts, go to  Settings  >  About phone  and tap on the  Build Number  seven times.  Go back to settings and open  Developer Options .  Under “ Drawing”  category turn on the Multi-window mode.  BOOM! Split screen mode unlocked!   Now you can select the multi-window mode from your recent app menu, as easy as that.   I have had no issues using this function and apps’ performance has been stable. It works fluently and is really useful. Unfortunately, you can’t re-size the windows, but hey you got dual window mode!  Are there any hidden Android functions you know? Let us know in the comments.

To add a surplus amount of happiness for this Christmas and New Year, two smartphone giants are offering a price drop on their devices. The smartphones to receive a price reduction are  Huawei P9 Lite  and  Gionee P7 Max . As Huawei P9 lite and Gionee P7 Max receive a price drop, the presence of Santa could be felt this year. These devices have received a price reduction during the festive season, however, it is not an offer for Christmas or New Year; this is a permanent price drop.  Receiving a price drop of Rs. 3,700 from Rs. 31,999, Huawei P9 Lite is now available for Rs. 28,300. Offering Rs, 3,000 drops in its initial price of Rs. 21,999, Gionee P7 Max is now available for Rs. 18,999.  Huawei P9 Lite overview  Huawei P9 Lite  Packed up inside an alluring metallic frame and an embedded square fingerprint slot on its back, P9 Lite has got a good aesthetics, the same aesthetics as its pricier sibling P9. However, the sibling surpassed this device in many respects. Bearing a Leica’s 12.3 MP dual camera on its back when this device remains stuck with 13MP Sony IMX 214 f/2.0 camera is the premium. Huawei’s in-house SoC, HiSilicon Kirin 650 powers the device, which is an octa-core processor. The octa-core chipset has an inbuilt four cores of Cortex A53 that works at 2.0 GHz speed and another four cores Cortex A53 that works on 1.7 GHz speed. On the display, Huawei P9 Lite inherits a 5.2” IPS LCD screen, which supports Full HD resolutions. Packed with a pixel density of 424 PPI, the display looks great. However, the lack of screen protection has made the device crack-prone and scratch-prone.        The 7.5 mm sleek device bears a 8 MP, f/2.0 front shooter which takes good selfies. However, the lack of front flashing LED has constricted its scope. The device is injected with 16 GB internal memory and 2 GB or 3 GB of RAM. The half of the internal memory is usurped by the system and if you wish to extend the memory; you have to sacrifice your wish to use two SIM cards in the device since this device employs a Hybrid slot. The another feature, which is not dominated by its flagship sibling is the battery. The device is fueled by a 3000 mAh non-removable battery, which lasts pretty longer. So, you do not have to constrict your interests to use your device longer.  Huawei P9 Lite Specs:   5.2 inches IPS LCD (1080 x 1920 pixels ) @424ppi  Android Marshmallow 6.0  HiSilicon Kirin 650 Chipset  Octa-core (4×2.0 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4×1.7 GHz Cortex-A53)  Mali-T830MP2 GPU  16 GB, 2 GB or 3 GB RAM  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G, 4G LTE  microSD, up to 256 GB (Hybrid slot)  Rear camera: 13 MP, f/2.0, autofocus, LED flash; 1/3″ sensor size, 1.12 µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama, HDR  Front camera: 8 MP, f/2.0  Fingerprint (rear-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass  Non-removable 3000 mAh battery  Price  Rs. 31,999  Rs. 28,300   Could Huawei P9 Lite be a good buy?  Huawei P9 Lite sports good features in its own way. However, in the similar price range, we can get devices, which out-perform Huawei P9 Lite in one form on other. In a minor deviation of price, Gionee S6s, Huawei GR5 2017, Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 or Samsung Galaxy J7 prime can be its competitors.  Gionee P7 Max overview  Gionee P7 Max  P7 Max made its arrival on October of this year with a 5.5” IPS LCD\xa0display. The display has a 267 PPI pixel density and supports a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. The display is nothing out of ordinary as the devices in the similar price category offers similar or superior display specs. Mediatek MT6595 SoC powers the device, which is an octa-core processor that runs on the clock speed of 2.2 GHz. Under the hood, the device furnishes a 13 MP camera on its back. The back shooter is accompanied by a LED flash to ensure photo clarity in low-light photography. However, the 5 MP front shooter lacks this feature.  The device is injected with an internal memory of 32 GB and RAM of 3 GB. The 3 GB RAM of the device ensures a lag-free performance. The memory can be extended to 128 GB with the use of SD card. Talking about the sensors, the device is enriched with Accelerometer, proximity, compass. However, the device lacks a fingerprint sensor, which has been a common spec even in low-end devices. The phone is furnished with a 3100 mAh non-removable battery. The battery provides better backup to the device, so you should not remain adhered with the charger.

Under this price range, 3 GB of RAM and 3100 mAh battery is a rare spec. This device could be the best buy in this price category. However, Gionee Marathon M5 Lite and Xiaomi Redmi 3S could still be a good competitor.  Two good smartphones, Huawei P9 Lite and Gionee P7 Max receive a price drop.

While the series is known for its affordable smartphones, the Huawei Honor Magic costs CNY 3,700 (equivalent to $530). But the features it packs are equal to none.        The device sports a not-so-tall 5.09-inch crisp AMOLED display with the resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels (577 PPI). The glass slab covering the display edges out at three corners, making the Honor Magic look really smooth, glossy and something I have never seen before.   Under the hood, the Huawei Honor Magic is powered by the company’s very own Octa-core Kirin 960 processor clocked at 2.3 GHz and 1.8 GHz (4×2.3 GHz Cortex-A72 & 4×1.8 GHz Cortex A53). 4GB RAM and Mali-T880 MP4 GPU work alongside the aging processor. There is no storage option as the device is only available in 64GB variant with no support for external memory. It runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with a new Magic Live UI on top.  The software front is the major selling point of the device. It has some top notch Artificial Intelligence driven features. I have made a list of those features below:   The best one of the lot is the WiseScreen sensor. A frame sensor, and an infrared sensor in the front facing camera combine to recognize the device’s owner’s eyes and hands to turn on the display. So, when you pick up the phone, the display lights up, and when you put the phone down or somewhere else, the display turns off.  People reading your messages they weren’t supposed to see? The Honor Magic solves that problem from a feature known as FaceCode Intelligent Recognition. This feature will make sure that message notifications are shown to the pre-registered faces and no one else.  The device can also automatically realize you are driving and suggest you switch to driving mode.  It can also know when you have arrived at a movie theater and show the booked ticket number automatically.  The device can itself recognize a dark environment and turn on the flashlight.   Huawei Honor Magic follows the trend of growing number of Huawei’s smartphones featuring dual rear cameras. The device is equipped with 12-megapixel dual-lens rear facing cameras (for colored and monochrome pictures) with f/2.2 aperture, and an 8-megapixel front facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. It lacks the Leica branding, though. Other features include USB Type-C connector, Bluetooth v4.2, Dual Nano-SIM and a front-mounted fingerprint sensor.

The list goes like this:         Google Cardboard  Samsung Gear VR  Oculus Rift  HTC Vive  Sony PlayStation VR\xa0   (Note: The above list is not in any order specified.)  You may have heard about the AR(Augmented Reality). It’s totally different from VR. AR is the combination of the virtual objects in real world whereas, VR is the immersion of one in the virtual world irrespective of the real scenario. Pokemon Go™,  Microsoft’s HoloLens , etc are the examples of it.  We can see VR Technology to be hatching in the Nepali market nowadays. There are plenty of retailers which provides the peripherals across various major cities of Nepal.

Fastrack Communication is the manufacturer of Lemon Mobiles which has been present in Nepal for quite some time. Out of 28 phones manufactured by Lemon, 16 of the phones are available in Nepal and they range from the price of Rs. 800 to Rs. 3,300. As of now, there’s an ongoing research to figure out, to establish the manufacturing plan in Kathmandu or Butwal.   Any stuff that is locally produced has great chances of being really cheap. When it comes to tech, we are paying a hefty amount and we all know that well. Specifically the growing market of smartphone, where every other day we get to witness a new product or a new brand but if we look at their price tag they are expensive compared to other countries. Not only the smartphones but even with regular phones, the story is the same.  Like the market of smartphones, the market of bar phones is also ever growing. Most of the people still carry a bar phone as a secondary phone along with their smartphones. If you look at other places besides the cities of Nepal, the majority of people still prefer and buy bar phones. So, if we are able to locally produce phones in Nepal, the prices are sure to get cheap which will open doors for the majority of people to afford a \xa0phone and communicate. Starting small, this manufacturing plant can also produce other tech related items in the future which would be a great deal. It’s just a starting phase so we have to sit back and see what progress would be made in this project.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pexels-photo-29309-scaled.jpg']

['NTC testing 4G in its network'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['December 15, 2016']",2016-12-15 08:14:58+00:00,"['Nepal Telecom, the government-owned telecommunication service provider in Nepal, is unofficially reported to have been testing 4G in their network. It is no surprise as it has already got a license to operate 4G in Kathmandu and Pokhara. The rumor of NTC launching 4G in these two major cities in the\xa0second week of Poush is likely to turn into reality.  Nepal Telecom is bringing 4G technology by undertaking hardware and software upgrades in its already existing system. The 4G LTE that is going to be launched in Nepal will be of FDD band 3 as it will be working on 1800MHz. Make sure your phone supports this band before upgrading to 4G after the service goes live.  What is 4G? And why do we even need it?  You might have lots of curiosity\xa0on what exactly is 4G. I’d like to address that curiosity of yours in simplest of words possible.\xa0In short, it’s the name given to the fourth generation of mobile networks, just as the previous generation is called 3G. 4G is found coming together with the word LTE which stands for\xa0Long Term Evolution and is a type of 4G technology.\xa04G LTE aims to offer users faster, more reliable mobile broadband internet for devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.        4G is better and faster than 3G, a whole lot better. It has an incredible peak speed of 100Mbps (Megabits per second) theoretically only. Practically, a lot less but greater than twice that of 3G. 4G uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) technology. Basically, it’s a method of splitting and tight packing of data for parallel transmission using MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) concepts. Basically, in laymen’s term 4G is a fast internet service provided by mobile networks with the high speed of 100Mbps.  Nepal Telecommunication Corporation(NTC) is the winner in the race for approval of the license. According to NTC, the prevailing WiMAX Service is up to the standard of 4G. Ncell has also applied for the license. Minister for Information and Communication, Mr. Sherdhan Rai said that the existing 3G service will be expanded nationwide and 4G service will be started at Kathmandu Metropolitan City along with some major sub-metropolitan cities.  The major drawback for 4G is its lack of traditional circuitry for telephony service as like in 3G. But we can use VoLTE (Voice over LTE) function provided by apps like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Facebook, etc. for telephony service. If someone wants to make a voice call from 4G network without VoLTE feature, the network is automatically dropped to 3G or 2G network.  The necessity of 4G is felt at various places. A better internet ensures the uninterrupted call (voice or video) to their loved ones. A faster one takes less time to download or upload a great movie, songs, images, etc. Live streaming is possible without waiting for buffering. And best of all speed ensures the development of a nation is on right track.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NTC_Nepal.jpg']
['Charge Your Phone from the movement of a finger'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['December 15, 2016']",2016-12-15 02:40:25+00:00,"['The advancement of technology and science never fails to amaze us. One day, science will put forward an idea, overwhelm us with its effect and the next day, it does the same. Feels like a never ending cycle, doesn’t it? Not that any of us, are complaining or something, anyways.  The amount of energy that one uses, releases while walking might seem inefficient to run powerhouses and factories. But, provided with a perfectly efficient process, the energy we expend on taking a single stride could be used to operate certain devices. We are surrounded by such devices that do not require much power to operate; a couple of volts could take them a long way. This shows that the days of having to carry around a phone charger everywhere could be coming to an end soon. One may soon be able to charge cell phones and power Bluetooth headsets with the swipe of a finger as scientists have developed a device that can harvest energy from human motion.  The engineers involved in the project had published a research in the journal “Nano Energy”; as per the research, they were able to successfully operate an LCD touchscreen, a bank of 20 light emitting diode (LED) lights and a flexible keyboard by simply touching or pressing motion and without the use of a battery. That type of foldable keyboard is called “Bio-compatible Ferroelectret Nano-generator” (FENG). Nelson Sepulveda, Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Lead Investigator of the project said that they were on the path towards wearable devices powered by human motion. He further mentions that in the future the energy required to charge our cell phones for an entire week will be produced by our own movements.        They started with a silicon wafer that was fabricated with several layers of substances such as silver, polyimide and polypropylene ferroelectret. Ions were then added to each layer in the device containing charged particles and energy was created by compressing the device through mechanical energy, or human motion.  FENG is as thin as a sheet of paper and can be adapted to many applications and sizes. This puts forward many other advantages such as flexibility, biocompatibility, scalability, affordability, robust structure; thus making FENG an alternative method in the field of mechanical energy harvesting for many autonomous electronics such as wireless headsets, cell phones, and other touch-screen devices.  The high-level picture is that the FENG winds up with really huge magnetic poles of opposite charge that exist on its different layers, which then change in relation to each other as the material is deformed under pressure. This change results in differences in electrical potential, which is what gives us the useful electrical energy.  The journal describes some advantages in view of the environment, health, and safety as well. The fabrication of encapsulated FENG avoids the use of harmful elements (e.g. lead) or toxic materials (e.g. carbon nanotubes), making it more attractive for bio-compatible and perhaps even implantable applications.  The device also has the neat property of becoming more powerful when folded. In a statement, Sepulveda explains: “Each time you fold it you are increasing exponentially the amount of voltage you are creating. You can start with a large device, but when you fold it once, and again, and again, it’s now much smaller and has more energy. Now it may be small enough to put in a specially made heel of your shoe so it creates power each time your heel strikes the ground.”  Safe, environment-friendly and interesting; what is more to ask for?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Huawei-GR5-Mini-Single-Handed-usage.png']

While talking about Huawei P9, we can’t skip talking about its dual-lens cameras at the back that was made in partnership with Leica. We’ve seen dual-lens cameras in many flagship phones this year including LG G5, iPhone 7 plus and many others. Yes, it’s definitely not the first time we’ve seen dual-lens camera setup in smartphones. It all started in the year of 2011 when LG Optimus 3D and HTC Evo 3D sported dual lens setup in their back. Then on 2014, HTC again added another phone in Dual-Lens bandwagon with the release of HTC One M8. We’ll certainly see more phones with Dual-Lens setup in days to come. But, it is necessary to understand how a phone is making use of that particular set-up. Not all the dual-lens in smartphone work the same. For instance, LG G5 uses its dual-lens for providing wider shots and videos. That of iPhone 7 plus provides the ability of two times of optical zooming and better depth of field effect while taking portraits.         To talk about the dual-lens in Huawei P9, they are engineered for providing better details in photographs. Here the two lenses used are both of 12Megapixels where one is an RGB sensor and other is a monochrome one. The monochrome lens captures the details in the shot without colors and then the RGB lens captures the color part of the image. Inside the phone, the merging of two images happens and finally an image with greater detail and richer colors will be produced. Not only that, Huawei claims this new setup of cameras, provide faster and greater focuses in images. Well, dual-lens cameras certainly give better results as opposed to the single lens one. But few might complain on P9 to not have Optical Image Stabilization in its setup.

['Huawei Mobile Nepal set to launch a smartphone with dual cameras'],['Huawei'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['December 13, 2016']",2016-12-13 12:52:48+00:00,"['Are you looking to step up your smartphone photography game? Good news.  Huawei Mobile Nepal  is set to release a smartphone featuring dual cameras here in Nepal. While the company is still keeping the model a secret, we can expect the device to be either the  Huawei Honor 8  or the Huawei Honor 6x ( GR5 2017 ).  Released in July 2016, the Huawei Honor 8 is regarded as one of the best budget smartphones of 2016. It features great specifications at a pretty affordable price. The Huawei Honor 8 sports a 5.2-inch LTPS display with the resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels (423 PPI). Under the hood, the device is powered by an Octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 950 processor that is aided by whopping 4GB RAM and a Mali-T880 Mp4 GPU. It runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Nougat update already made available for Beta testers. One of the major selling points of the device is its dual camera. Both rear facing cameras are of 12-megapixel with f/2.2 aperture. A laser autofocus complements the cameras helping them in focusing objects under milliseconds. The front camera measures 8-megapixel with f/2.4 aperture. It features USB Type-C connector that supports fast battery charging and a fingerprint sensor at the back. The whole device is backed by a 3,000mAh battery.  An upgrade to the Huawei Honor 5x, the Honor 6x is priced at $148 (999 Yuan) internationally but features some top-notch specifications. It flaunts a 5.5-inch 1080p display with 403 PPI. For a device priced at such a low cost, it packs a powerful processor. The Huawei Honor 6x is powered by an Octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 655 SoC, 3/4GB RAM (depending on the storage option) and a Mali-T830MP2 GPU. A document leaked a couple months back stated that this device’s operating system will be upgraded to Android 7.0 Nougat from the present Marshmallow OS. It features a 12-megapixel and a 2-megapixel rear facing dual cameras with phase detection autofocus. The front camera is an 8-megapixel sensor. The Honor 6x also features a fingerprint sensor, fast battery charging, and DTS audio. A huge 3,340mAh battery aides the device, making it last long.        Whichever device Huawei Mobile Nepal is set to release, we surely will get to see an amazing and powerful device launch in the Nepali market. And if the company gets the pricing for the device right, we might get to see a new king of the budget smartphone category.

['Report: Growth of smartphones is declining fast'],[],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['December 13, 2016']",2016-12-13 05:27:33+00:00,"['Smartphones used to be this thing of wonder which amazed us every day. Things we thought we couldn’t do on the go, well, smartphones pretty much proved it wrong. Now, you don’t need to carry a separate camera, music player, voice recorder, entertainment system or anything, everything you ever needed is neatly sitting in your pocket as a single device right now. But to reach to this state, there was a successive development, every year we saw a new feature that usually required a separate device: like the first year, it was a camera, then music player, voice recording, video recording and app support that pretty much opened up a whole new world.  Gartner’s  study has shown that people use the same smartphone for the span of 2 to 2.5 years and will remain same till 2020. People are even skipping few generations to finally upgrade when they see something innovative. The growth of smartphone will not be in double digits, worldwide smartphones sales have grown only 7% to reach 1.5 billion units in 2016 which is a serious decline from 14.4% in 2015. Smartphone sales growth was highest in 2010\xa0reaching 73% but ever since\xa0there has been major ups and downs in the market.  Smartphones have really gotten boring, every smartphone is the same piece of a rectangular metal slab with a giant screen up front. For the past few years, the only change in the smartphones has been a more shinier display, more powerful processor, more RAM and more megapixels! You can’t even distinguish between a midrange and a premium phone these days. People are happy with what they’ve got, be it a midrange or flagship. They can easily comply with our day to day usage pretty good. In a mature market, people don’t change their smartphones yearly like they used to, and every year the iPhone or any other phone isn’t getting any more innovative or smarter which at this point we all have realized.        The market penetration in European nations, North America, and developed\xa0Asian countries have reached 90% where users are sticking with their flagships longer. So manufacturers are targeting India and China where the consumers are high where they could boost their sales. But even doing so, most of the smartphone sales will be budget oriented in these regions and that won’t have much effect on the declining profit.  The future of smartphones\xa0is in VR,\xa0AI-powered devices and something that can provide real usefulness like the Windows phone which can also be used as a full-fledged Windows PC. For now, the path that smartphone development is taking seems pretty awesome but there are also other things we can expect which may possibly remove the need of smartphones like smart glasses and wearable tech.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dsf.jpg']
['Report: Less than 15% Population From Underdeveloped Countries Have Internet Access'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['December 13, 2016']",2016-12-13 04:08:46+00:00,"['According to a recent report from a United Nation agency, almost half of the world population will be online by the end of December (i.e. the end of the year 2016).  This is probably due to the decreasing price of mobile phones and mobile internet’s prices, the report by the United Nation’s International Telecommunications Union (ITU) stated.  Even with half of the world population set to go online by 2016, the number of the users are still concentrated in the developed countries. As the year comes to an end, about 80 percent of the people from developed countries are using the internet. The number computes to around 40 percent in the developing countries and only 15 percent in the less developed (or underdeveloped) countries.        When combined, all this calculates to about 47 percent of the world’s population going online, which is still 13 percent short of one of United Nation’s target of 60 percent population going online by 2020. The data shows that about 3.5 billion people are expected have internet access by the end of this year.  The report has mentioned that only 1 person among 10 is online in Africa, and other poor and fragile countries.  According to the union, a specialized agency for information and communication technologies, the offline population mainly consists of less educated people, poor people, people living in rural areas, the female and the elderly.  Even with more than 50 percent of the population offline, 47 percent is still a good number. This has happened mostly due to smartphone manufacturers decreasing their mobile phones’ price, and telecommunication companies providing cheaper mobile internet to their users.  Although there is a trend of most of the less developed nations’ population not having access to the internet, the number of Nepalis having access to the internet is increasing. A research conducted by Nepal Telecommunication Authority in 2015 showed that nearly 44.11 percent of the population had internet access. This surely has increased in 2016 with the increased number of budget smartphones entering the nation every now and then.  Talking about the less developed nations, the report stated,  ‘Internet penetration levels in less developed countries today have reached the level enjoyed by developed countries in 1998, suggesting that the less developed countries are lagging nearly 20 years behind the developed countries .’  2016 was a fruitful year in the internet sector. With 47 percent of the world already online, the 60 percent target set by U.N. isn’t that far away.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ZTE-V7-Lite-build-scaled.jpg']
['Undestanding fingerprint technology : Does your smartphone have one?'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['December 12, 2016']",2016-12-12 11:05:20+00:00,"['There are many of us, who are tired of setting our phone lock in a pattern, pin or password mode. They are often predictable and our privacy is always on a stake. However, the technology has made a leap. Nowadays, the technology has arrived where we can set our phone privacy to “only me” mode. This has been possible with the introduction of fingerprint technology. Therefore, to unveil this mystifying technology, we have tried our best in this article.  What is fingerprint technology?  Fingerprint technology falls under the classification of Biometrics. Biometrics is an automated method of recognizing a person based on a physiological or behavioral characteristic. The features or characteristics the Biometrics includes are the face, fingerprints, hand geometry, handwriting, iris, retinal, vein, and voice. Biometric data are separate and distinct from personal information. Biometric templates cannot be reverse-engineered to recreate personal information. Therefore, they avoid theft and ensure the safety of your personal information.  As the name implies, fingerprint technology only deals with the fingerprint of the user. This technology essentially requires a fingerprint sensor on your device. The fingerprint sensor scans your fingerprint and if matched it unlocks your device. The most interesting fact regarding the fingerprint is that even the twin possesses different fingerprints. So, having your phone in the hand of your sibling will no longer be a threat to you if you have kept a fingerprint lock.        How does fingerprint technology work?  Based on principles, there are mainly three classifications of fingerprint sensors and their working principles are discussed here.  1. Optical fingerprint scanners  Fingerprint technology made a debut through the optical fingerprint scanners. So, they are the most primitive type of fingerprint tech on the list. And as implied by the name, this technology relies on the optical image or photograph (to be exact) of the finger. And with the photos taken, it determines whether the pattern of ridges and valleys in the image matches the pattern of ridges and valleys in pre-scanned images. For comparing such unique patterns, a special set of algorithms are employed there. Matching the special types of marks, ridges, and valleys of the fingerprint with the registered one, the device gets unlocked.  As mentioned earlier, Optical fingerprint scanner takes images of the finger. So it has some analogies with the camera. Just like a camera sensor, the optical scanners also come with a finite resolution. And higher the resolution, the finer details the sensor can detect. Thus offering a higher level of security. However, this type of sensor does not literally fall under the secure type of fingerprint sensor. Optical fingerprint sensors are not difficult to fool as this sensor technically involves in capturing the 2D image. So even a synthetic picture of fine quality can be used to trick and bypass this particular design.  2. Capacitive scanners  This type of fingerprint sensor is common among the smartphones trending these days. This type of\xa0finger-scanning\xa0device uses a bunch of capacitive\xa0proximity sensors, along with a\xa0microcomputer\xa0and associated electronic signal processing circuits, to create and store a digital image of a human fingerprint. [socialpoll id=”2406660″] Unlike Optical fingerprint scanner, instead of photographing an image of the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint, a capacitive finger scanner’s sensors generate a complex pattern of electrical\xa0currents. A bunch of capacitors employed in the system records the complex pattern of electric currents. When a finger’s ridge touches the conductive plates, the capacitor charges slightly. But when the sensor faces an air gap, the capacitor will remain relatively uncharged. These complex set of signals are processed to form a digital image of the fingerprint. Since the presence of a human finger in the capacitive scanner is mandatory in order to generate the image; it is more difficult to fool it than an optical device.  3. Ultrasonic scanners  As the name suggests, this technology employs ultrasonic waves to detect the pattern of the fingerprint. It essentially requires an ultrasonic transmitter and ultrasonic receiver. When the user places his finger in the fingerprint scanner, the transmitter sends a gust of ultrasonic waves. Some of the sent waves get absorbed while some of some them reflect back after striking the finger. The intensity of the reflected waves determines the ridges, valleys, and pores of the finger. This type of scanners saves a 3D image of the finger and hence is more secure than the capacitive scanners. This type of scanner is the most secure scanner in our list.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_9729-scaled.jpg']

The primary objective of this 5 days long expo is to accommodate all Mobile manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers and service providers under the same roof .  Raghu Tripathi, general secretary of expo organizing association, said “In the expo, National and International service providers and manufacturers will be introducing high tech products and services”. “Mobile phone company’s new products will be introduced, interaction between service providers and customers and opportunity towards wider choices for the buyers will be the main attraction in the expo”, he added.  In NMDA mobile expo, there will certainly be special discounts and gifts to the visitors. There will be 130 stalls in total, out of which, 17 stalls inside the main hall will be of the mobile phone importers displaying the latest mobile phones they have imported. Visitors can certainly get to know about the offerings from those latest handheld devices. But to buy a phone, visitors can only buy from the retailing outlets kept outside of the main hall. Unlike biased expos in the past, this expo is giving stalls for all interested mobile manufacturing companies, importers, distributors and retailers from Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur.        The expo is going to be held in coordination with different mobile brands so a little more discounts than usual can be expected but will that be enough to make this expo a must-go? Well, I personally, don’t think so. Looking at the expos from the past, an expo in Nepal is nothing but a hype.  For instance, the well-known expos like that of CAN are now being nothing more than a place to sell internet services, mobile sim-cards, computers and accessories. That are something which are easily available anywhere. So what is the point of going to the expo, if you are buying the same already available products and services? What I’m certain about these kinds of expos is there will be huge crowds for sure. Many of those who’ll pay a visit in this kind of expos will later be disappointed and won’t be recommending any of their friends or families to go. I wish if there could be some kind of real Tech Expos in Nepal that would reflect something new, something revolutionary in Tech Industry. Until and Unless the latest mobiles are being released in an event like this, I won’t consider visiting it.  But in this mobile expo by NMDA, the organizers are claiming it to offer a different experience. The NMDA team is positive towards this event to be a successful one that’ll aid Mobile Market in Nepal through brand promotions and brand awareness. It is likely to motivate customers to buy mobiles from white markets as opposed to gray ones. In this mobile fair, visitors will surely find some food stalls as well. How effective, entertaining and successful this expo will be, is something that is still yet to see.  Will you go in an expo that will be overcrowded and will offer nothing more than few hundreds of discounts? Is it justifiable for an expo to be organized that offers nothing but phones from yesterday\xa0or yesteryear more likely? Have you ever been to any kinds of such expos? If yes, share your experience with us in comments down below.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nepal-mobile-expo.jpg']
"['Lenovo K5 Note Review: High on features, low on performance']","['Android', 'Lenovo', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['December 12, 2016']",2016-12-12 04:15:53+00:00,"['Lenovo is slowly trying to crawl its way into the Nepali smartphone market after its success as one of the best selling laptop manufacturers here. In that process, it launched the much-hyped  Lenovo K5 Note  a while back. Priced competitively at Rs. 27,500, with an ANTVR headset bundled in with the deal, the device features some top of the line specs.  If the price range is considered, it will go against some of the premium devices like the  Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ,  Gionee S6s ,  Meizu M3 Note ,  ZTE Axon mini , and  OnePlus X  among others. The K5 Note does feature some high-end specifications, but does it perform well in real life? Is it pricing justified? Is this a device you won’t regret spending on? Let’s find out in this review.  DESIGN (3.5/5)  The Lenovo K5 Note features a metal backing with plastic bands on the top and bottom for antennae signals. A camera sits between the top plastic band and the metal back. I was let down by the device’s design at first glance. The design is dull and didn’t appeal me.        There is a LED flash right below the camera and a fingerprint sensor right below the LED flash. The second plastic band gives space for a speaker grill. The K5 Note also has a secondary mic for background noise cancellation.        1  of 6                                                                              Moving on, the metal-cum-plastic backing is separated from the display by a plastic rim. Yes, this device features a metal backing but everything else is plastic. This rim feels cheap along the power button and the volume rocker. I don’t know why the manufacturer didn’t go for a full metal body instead. Yes, the plastic antennae bands are acceptable but the rims and the buttons too? And I should mention the ‘Kriiiikkk’ sound the plastic makes which added more to my disappointment.  At the front, there is a 5.5-inch that is accompanied by an ear piece, a front facing camera, accelerometer, gyro, and proximity sensors. There are off-screen navigation buttons below the display. The bottom of the display is engraved with a primary mic and a microUSB charging port.  DISPLAY (3.5/5)  The Lenovo K5 Note features a 5.5-inch IPS LCD 1080 x 1920 pixels display with 401 for the pixel per inch. The display is bright and vivid. On default, the screen was a tad bit warm to my liking. But I could easily change that since there is an option that lets you toggle the color temperature, tone, and saturation of the display. The display isn’t that super bright. But under ample lighting, you’ll only have difficulty while viewing objects with dark backgrounds. The ambient sensor helps in the outdoor visibility when the brightness is set to auto.   The thick black band around the display is something I didn’t like at all, and the lack of 2.5D glass makes the device look dreary. [Note: Dear smartphone manufacturers, please don’t include the black band here onwards. It is annoying and makes the device less appealing.] Lenovo hasn’t mentioned the nature of the protective glass of the display, and it certainly isn’t Corning Gorilla Glass like its predecessor – the Lenovo K4 Note. So, I suggest you get a screen protector for the device right away!  PERFORMANCE (2.5/5)  Under the hood, the Lenovo K5 Note features an Octa-core MediaTek MT6755 Helio P10 processor with a clock speed of 4 x 1.8 GHz and 4 x 1.0 Ghz. You might have heard gadget freaks talk about how cores and RAM can’t determine a smartphone’s performance quality. The Lenovo K5 Note is the perfect example of that statement. A beast of a device on paper with a whopping 4GB RAM (we got the 4GB variant for our review; 3GB variant is only available in Nepal), the device lags, that you might get annoyed. One of the main reasons for this (or the only reason) is probably its SoC, the MediaTek Helio P10.      Benchmark Scores   1  of 5               Antutu Score         Geekbench Score         Vellamo Score         Nenamark2 Score         Quadrant Score                           Under heavy usage, the device lags, and stutters, and sometimes apps don’t respond and you get that annoying little ‘App not responding’ popup. On top of that, it sometimes lags even when using the device normally. Even with its good RAM management, it slowed down here and there.  CAMERA (3/5)  Specs wise, the Lenovo K5 note features a 13-megapixel rear facing camera with f/2.2. This camera is equipped with phase detection autofocus, HDR, panorama and accompanied by single LED flash.   Well, forgetting about the camera specs, and focusing on its use in real life, the camera is average. It takes good pictures under bright light. They come out colorful and bright. However, under low-lit setting, the K5 Note is no different than the smartphones of its price range. The pictures come out noisy and way too grainy. I should also mention that I couldn’t\xa0differentiate the pictures taken normally and the ones taken with HDR.      Camera Samples   1  of 4                                                          The camera app is easy to use. It lets you toggle features such as white balance and ISO. It also comes with some basic effects like Mono, Sepia, Negative, Memory, Gorgeous, Elegant and Cool. The camera focuses on objects quickly.   The front facing camera is of 8-megapixel. It takes some really good social media ready pictures. If selfie is your thing, you’ll like this front camera.  SOFTWARE (4/5)  The Lenovo K5 Note used to run on Android 5.1 Lollipop when it was released in January. But the company has upgraded its Android system which means that it now runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. There have been no talks of Nougat, however.  The device has Lenovo’s Vibe UI running on top of Android Marshmallow. There was a few bloatware, but hey, there is at least an option to uninstall those apps! I had no problem navigating through the UI. The software department looks quite stock-esque. There is also a theme manager that lets you change the theme (useful for changing some of the icons).      Lenovo K5 Note UI    1  of 5                                                                    There are other features like ‘double tap to wake’, quick snap (takes pictures when you press the volume button twice when the screen is off) and some cool fingerprint gestures. It also comes with Secure Zone, Superpower, and Cast screen.  Probably the best feature of the Lenovo K5 Note is the option to use a split-screen mode for VR mode. While in other smartphones you have to install different apps for this feature, this device comes with Theater Max Technology making gaming and multimedia a worthwhile experience.  HARDWARE (4/5)  On the hardware side, the Lenovo K5 Note is quite good actually. The device is equipped a Dolby Atmos speaker that produces some great quality sound. Even though the speaker can be blocked when using the device, the loud and clear sound covers up this problem. So, if you’re into watching videos or listening to audios, you might like this device. It\xa0also features Wolfson DAC. While using headphones, the sound did get loud, but I couldn’t sense any other changes.   Talking about the storage, the K5 Note features a 32GB option for both the 3GB and 4GB variant. There is an external storage option which lets you expand the storage up to 128GB. So, if you’re heavy into saving tons of files on your phone, you won’t be disappointed with this device. The only downside is that the device has a dual hybrid sim slot so you have to choose between expandable storage option and a second SIM.  The off screen navigation buttons are backlit making your usage in a dark environment easier.  FINGERPRINT (4/5)  The fingerprint sensor of the Lenovo K5 Note detects fingerprint and unlocks the device in an instant. There were rare hiccups, though, meaning the sensor worked 95% of the times. The fingerprint can be used for other functions too. Different gestures let you take pictures, and go back or to directly to your home screen.   CONNECTIVITY (4/5)  The Lenovo K5 Note has dual hybrid SIM slots for two GSM Nano-SIM cards which mean you need to choose between a second sim and expandable storage. The device supports 4G connectivity and VOLTE. Other connectivity options include WiFi b/g/n, GPS, Bluetooth v4.2, hotspot and FM Radio. The call quality was good and the device sensed WiFi signals better than some other smartphones.  BATTERY (4/5)  A big 3,500mAh battery runs the show in the Lenovo K5 Note. The battery gave me a screen-on-time of around 4.5-5 hours under heavy usage which was less than what I had expected since the device features a 1080p display. This usage consisted of constant web browsing, using several apps at the same time and playing some high-end games. If you are a moderate user, the device will last you for around a day and a half. Even though the battery life is average, the embedded Quick Charge Technology charges the battery swiftly. The K5 Note probably has the fastest battery charging technology in its price range.   CONCLUSION  Like I previously mentioned, Lenovo is trying to crawl its way into the Nepali smartphone market, and the K5 Note is probably a huge part of it. Featuring some awesome specs on paper, it could easily have been the best device in its price range. It comes with an inbuilt VR mode, a great speaker, fast charging and a good fingerprint sensor. But everything else is either average or below par. With lots of budget smartphones releasing almost every week, its bid to become one of Nepal’s popular smartphone seller could be in danger.  The Lenovo K5 Note is a VR ready phone and comes with different useful features. But that doesn’t cover up its hideous performance. The device, for me, failed to pack a punch.

['Top disappointing Smartphones of 2016'],[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['December 10, 2016']",2016-12-10 14:23:17+00:00,"['Sometimes things do not go well as expected and this is valid with the smartphones manufacturers too. Sometimes the manufacturers fail to grasp the demand of the consumers and sometimes the products turned out to be defective. At the end, the products turn out to be a disappointment among the consumers. Here we have collected a list of disappointing smartphones of 2016, which turned our anticipation futile. Prev Next 1 Samsung Galaxy Note 7         With an introduction of Iris scanner and with the improvement of the camera than its predecessor, Note 7 had an alluring specification. However, things did not go as expected. The flagship device exploded out of the blue and hence topped the list of disappointing smartphones of 2016. Samsung blamed the battery for the explosion and called out the devices for the battery replacement. However, the battery replacement idea did not turn out to be a sustainable solution. The series of explosions did not stop even after the battery replacement. Hence, the manufacturers fall under the obligation to call back all the devices and to discontinue the sales and shipments. With the rumors of Galaxy Note 8 peaking in the tech market, tech freaks like me are anticipating to look the way Samsung to make its comeback. 2 LG G5         When LG launched its modular phone G5 at MWC, it promises everything that one would expect in a phone like QHD display, 4GB RAM, Qualcomm SD820 SoC, and removable battery. However, technical problems with modular\xa0camera modules, speakers,\xa0Battery drainage, and connectivity has plagued G5 owners. Moreover, priced at Rs. 75,000, the LG G5 was nowhere near its competitors S7 Edge that offered better display, camera, and battery life. 3 iPhone 7         Killing the 3.5 mm headphone jack, this year’s iPhone gained attention along with the controversy. Excluding the media hype, no much improvements were\xa0there to lure the 6S users for an upgrade. Running through the comparisons, iPhone 7 seem neglected as its sibling iPhone 7 plus being nurtured with higher end specs like fullHD display and dual camera lens. Though Apple forgot to put higher end specs to the iPhone 7, however, Apple was alert to put the pricing in the enormous range of 92,000 – 1,22,000 for the three variants. Turning a year’s anticipation futile, iPhone 7 also set a benchmark in the list of disappointing smartphones of 2016. 4 Microsoft Lumia 950 XL         When all the smartphone manufacturers are focusing on bringing Android smartphones, Microsoft has been the one not to follow the trend. However, Windows as the smartphone OS was not loved by the consumers as it was loved in computer gadgets. Nevertheless, the specs of Lumia 950 XL was of satisfying type. However, with the price difference Rs. 10,000 to its sibling Lumia 950, the differences we get was just a 0.5” increase in display and the upgraded CPU from Hexacore to Octacore. \xa0For bringing worthless specs for the price and for not having the fan favorite Android OS on its system, following the league, Lumia 950 XL also turned out to be a disappointment 5 Sony Xperia X         Closing the flagship line of Xperia Z series, Sony decided a moniker change in their devices. And Xperia X turned out to be a first descendent of the Xperia X series. However, the new Xperia X came out to bring the same taste in different attire. Excluding the upgrade of the front camera from 5.1MP to 13MP, there is no much change in the Xperia X as compared to its predecessor Z5. However, this superiority leveled out with a demotion of battery power from 2900 mAh to 2620 mAh and display size from 5.2” to 5.0”. Without an appreciable improvement and not much of the alluring specs, yet the price of the device costs a choking amount of 64,999. This not only turned disappointment among the consumers but also make Sony face criticism from the Sony fan base. 6 Xiaomi MI5         Despite the price drop from 49,999 to 44,999, Xiaomi MI5 is still overpriced in Nepal. Not just through the price, Xiaomi disappointed the consumers with the display too as it sports only a Full HD resolution. MI5 seem eclipsed as its Chinese neighbors are offering superior specs under the same price range. By the introduction of OnePlus 3, OnePlus became the first to surpass MI5. With this device out in the market, MI have been just an acronym to the “Mission Impossible”. Through the rumors to include retina scanner and 4K display in the MI6, Xiaomi already got prying eyes on its device. However, we are obliged to wait till 2017 to watch the comeback. The only thing we can hope is the new device will not be disappointing.  Prev Next']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Top-disappointing-Smartphones-of-2016.jpg']

['JBL CLip 2 Review: Best Portable BT Speaker?'],['Reviews'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['December 9, 2016']",2016-12-09 15:53:34+00:00,"['A phone with the perfect sounding built-in speaker is still a dream phone. In order to enjoy the quality music your phone can play, a Bluetooth speaker is something you should really have. With so many Chinese speakers available at five to ten times cheaper prices, is it worth buying a JBL Clip 2 for Rs. 8,000? Let’s find out in our video review.   Good things come in small packages and it happened to be true with JBL Clip 2. Inside the box, you’ll find some paperwork, a charging cable and the speaker itself. JBL Clip 2 resembles the hockey-puck design just like its predecessors. The stylish yet sturdy fabric up top is same as that of JBL charge 3. The rubberized plastic makes the rest of the housing rugged and gives a nice feel while holding. The real carabiner is as strong as it looks. It comes really handy to hook the speaker in belt loop or bags or anywhere you think it fits. The permanently attached Aux cable for wired use can be found resting along the edge of the speaker.\xa0    There are five different control buttons along the edge. They are like small indents (that make it easier to find, even in the dark. On the right, there’s a microUSB port for charging hidden under a gasket and is placed in the middle of power and Bluetooth button. This port is covered by a plastic gasket to prevent it from water damage. On the left edge, there are three buttons, call button and volume toggles. This call button is a multi-purpose one as it can be used for answering or ending the calls or to play/pause the music. It can also be used to trigger Google Now or Siri by long-pressing and while playing music you can play the next song by double clicking it.\xa0  The device is easy to use. After you pair it with your mobile for the first time, it gets automatically connected every time you power it on. The connection is strong and didn’t skip, not even once while in the same room, but it skipped a few times when I left the phone in one room and kept roaming with the speaker in another. It works the best as Bluetooth speakerphone with echo and noise cancellation mic inside. With 730 mAh battery, the power performance is up to the mark giving around 5 hours of playback when on max volume. For any portable SPEAKER, the louder the volume, faster the battery dies. So, You can even extend the already good battery life by playing the speaker at some levels below the maximum.\xa0        Boyce Avenue’s acoustic cover of Tracy Chapman’s Fast Car sounded so immersive. The guitar picking in Fleetwood Mac’s Never Going Back Again sounded too detailed for a speaker this size. Miles Davis’s Trumpet in Summertime sounded spot on. The speaker’s performance is just too damn good considering its size and price. It does well while producing mids and lows but distorts a bit in the highs. The vocals sound too immersive and any acoustic music will sound the best. There’s enough of bass but this tiny little thing struggles a bit while playing some bass heavy tracks like boom boom pow by the Black Eyed Peas.   The best thing about JBL Clip 2 is its IPX7 water resistance so you don’t need to worry about water spills, rain and even dropping in the pool. Charging the device takes around 2.5 hours. It can be charged via micro USB cable with any phone’s 5volt charging adapter. The LED light is red while charging and turns off when fully charged. With the IPX7 rating of water resistance, occasional water splashes and rains are something you shouldn’t ever worry about.   The only downside is there’s no battery level indicator, so only when the LED light starts blinking red that is the time you’ll realize it’s low on power.   If you’re after a quality Bluetooth speaker with durable and beautiful design, awesome battery backup, and that is super easy to carry around then JBL clip 2 is hands down the best option till the date.']",[]

We might as well say Nepal is a mountainous country because there are so many mountains in the Northern part of our country. But, being a Nepali, how many of them can you name (besides the famous ones)?  Well, if the answer was “few”, then you need to download this new app called “ Show Me Mountains ” now.  This app was launched today amidst Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF) at Russian Culture Centre, Kamalpokhari by one of the greatest mountaineers — Mr. Tendi Sherpa. This app is available for  Android  and  iOS  at free of cost.        Features:  As the name suggests, Show Me Mountains will show you the mountains around you. All you have to do is open the app, enable GPS and \xa0point your camera to whichever direction you want. The app will then display all the mountains facing your camera with their altitudes and the distances from you. You can also click on the mountains for detail facts.  The best thing about this app is you don’t need the Internet (Wifi or Mobile Data) to use it. However, this app uses GPS. So, make sure your Google Location Service is enabled.  The not-so-good news (at least for now) is you can only see mountains and hills that are visible from Kathmandu Valley. It will, of course, show famous peaks (that are above 8000 m tall) if you live outside Kathmandu. According to the developers, 160 peaks are in their database as for now and will be updated every two weeks.  Overall, this is a great concept. We can now appreciate the mountains and hills that make our country beautiful. Hope the developers will continuously update this app with more mountains as promised!\xa0 Finally, if you haven’t already installed the app, please try it out. And share your experience in the comments section below.  P.S. Some Android devices might experience some problems with the app, but be patient. I contacted the developers about the issues and they are looking into it.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/show-me-mountains-app.jpg']

Available at EvoStore and Oliz Store, the Phantom 4 Pro is priced at\xa0Rs. 2,15,000.  DJI Phantom 4 pro isn’t a new revolutionary drone, but an update to its predecessor Phantom 4 which came out just eight months ago. With that being said, Phantom 4 pro has a lot more to offer than any previously released Phantom units. As compared to Phantom 4, the Pro houses a better camera, more advanced (360 degrees) \xa0obstacle avoidance, greater battery life, and additional intelligent flight modes. With its release, Phantom line has become stronger as compared to the new Mavic pro which is still the smallest, most portable and cheapest among the newly released drones from DJI.  DJI Phantom 4 Pro price in Nepal is Rs. 2,15,000.  Digging out the specs, DJI Phantom 4 pro has a better camera with the mechanical shutter that will supposedly avoid Jell-O-like shake in the footage caused from rolling shutter effect while filming quick pans or chasing fast moving subjects. It has a 1-inch CMOS sensor that shoots 20 megapixels still and can capture upto 11.6 stops of dynamic range. In burst mode, pictures can be taken at speed of 14 photos per second. The camera is capable of taking 4k videos at 60 frames per second. The drone supports micro SD cards upto 128GB that has to be of class 10 or UHS – 1 rating.        Key features of DJI Phantom 4 Pro  Unlike the DJI Phantom 4 and Mavic Pro which had obstacle avoidance system that worked only while moving forward, the Phantom 4 pro has sensors on all four sides, meaning the drone can sense and avoid obstacles while moving in any direction. 31mph is the new top speed while in obstacle avoidance mode which is a remarkable bump as compared to old 22mph. Keep that in mind, 31 mph is top speed in p-mode \xa0and the drone can hit a max speed of 45 mph in sports mode.  With the new battery capacity of 5870 mAh, the battery life has got an upgrade too and the aircraft will give an approximate flight time of 30 Minutes. That is 20% of increment as compared to 25 minutes flight time of Phantom 4.  Phantom 4 Pro’s Controller with inbuilt screen  The remote controller has the control range of 4.3*miles transmitting HD output and intelligently switches between 2.4Ghz or 5.8 GHz choosing the one with the lowest interference at the time of starting the drone.

Despite being a phone from Mi, the phone was priced ridiculously high in Nepal, so after 8 months of launch, Mi5 is finally getting a priced drop. Previously priced at Rs. 50,000, the price has remained constant for 8 whole months despite having a tough competitor in the market:  OnePlus 3 . If you have been longing to buy an affordable flagship phone, take a look at the Xiaomi Mi 5 which is now priced at  Rs.39,999 .  Mi5 Overview:  Mi5 is one of the most comfortable flagship\xa0phones right now. Standing short at just 5.15”, you can easily maneuver this phone on one hand and it’s reasonably thin at 7.3mm. The curved glass panel back of the phone keeps the notion of its flagship tag. For a small Full HD display, it is packing some serious pixels(428ppi). So while playing games and watching movies, you are getting an absolutely great visual experience.  Powering the Mi5 is a quad-core Snapdragon 820 chipset, which also powers its competitor  OnePlus 3 . Performance wise, the phone is pretty fast for doing almost anything. You can easily play the latest high-end titles without any hick-ups. If you push the device too much, it will certainly show some lags and glitches but it’s nothing to worry about. Multitasking is great accompanied by 3GB of RAM.        Xiaomi Mi5 is only available in White Color options as of now.  Talking about Camera, it sports Rear 16MP Camera and Front 4MP Camera. The rear camera performs well in daylight and results in a good blend of colors in photos. It is capable of shooting 4K@30fps accompanied by OIS for shake resistance. \xa0Front 4MP camera also does a decent job in capturing selfies and group photos.  Mi5 is backed up by a 3,000mAh battery which provides decent SoT of around 4 hours. It also comes with 3 rd  Gen Quick Charge which can charge the device from 0 to 75% in 30mins.

It has a good balance of aesthetics, performance, camera, and battery. However, if i had a little bit more cash, i would go for the Galaxy S7 which is my pick for the best phone under Rs. 50,000.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xiaomi-mi5-price-nepal.jpg']

The jump from 4.2 to 5.0 means there will be some serious improvements. According to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), the new Bluetooth will be two times faster with 4 times more area coverage, and the data broadcasting capacity will also be elevated by 800 percentage.  The main purpose of this upgrade is to make it reliable for Internet of Things (IoT). This new version is said to decrease connection barriers and enable a seamless IoT experience. Mark Powell, executive director of the Bluetooth SIG quotes:   “Bluetooth 5 will make beacons, location awareness, and other connectionless services an even more relevant part of an effortless and seamless IoT experience.”   So, what can we expect from Bluetooth 5.0?        Reduced Interference  With so many wireless signals around us, Bluetooth 5.0 will improve the connectivity. It will reduce the potential \xa0interference so that your Bluetooth devices can coexist with other wireless devices. Developers can now use Slot availability masks in Bluetooth 5 to detect interference on neighboring bands and automatically prevent the interference.  Low Energy  If you are thinking the Bluetooth 5 will consume more energy because the speed and range have increased, well, according to the company, developers can decrease bandwidth to achieve up to 4x longer range while maintaining similar power requirements like previous versions. So, with improved power-efficiency in Bluetooth 5, you can use your devices for a longer period of time.   Improved Broadcasting  The broadcasting capacity has increased in Bluetooth 5. This means larger data packets(up to 256-octet) is now supported. This enables new features such as tracking your packages while \xa0maintaining backward compatibility with products developed for an earlier Bluetooth specification. Also, Bluetooth 5 will use broadcasting channels more efficiently on the increasingly crowded 2.4 GHz band so that you can experience smooth Bluetooth connection.  In addition, the speed of Bluetooth 5 has increased to 2 Mbps . This means you can transfer files in less time if your device has Bluetooth 5. Also, Bluetooth 5 will be compatible with previous versions (so you don’t need to throw away your old devices).  The devices featuring Bluetooth 5 will start launching within two \xa0to six months according to Bluetooth SIG. Well, we might see them at CES 2017. \xa0For now, all we can do is wait and see how developers utilize the features of Bluetooth 5.

JBL Clip 2 is the successor to JBL’s widely accepted budget friendly portable speaker JBL Clip.  The JBL Clip 2 has kept the same hockey-puck design like its predecessors. What has changed is the new stylish yet sturdy fabric in place of hard plastic speaker grills. It feels as good in the hand as it looks with its soft rubberized plastic housing at the button. It comes in five different color options of Blue, Black, Red, Grey, and Teal. Like its predecessors, permanently attached Aux cable with 3.5 mm jack is wrapped perfectly along its edge which can be used with devices that don’t have Bluetooth connectivity in them. The best improvement here is the real carabiner in place of plastic clip. Now, it’s much easier to clip the speaker to your belt loop or bags or anywhere you think it fits.         Now, the battery is of 730 mAh as compared to 600 mAh of older JBL clip. This addition in battery capacity can be felt as well.

['How to find the right microSD card for your phone'],"['Opinion', 'Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['December 4, 2016']",2016-12-04 11:46:07+00:00,"['One of the perks of preferring\xa0Android over iOS is definitely the option to have a removable storage. Right from the first Android device, HTC Dream, there always had been a micro SD card slot but recently OEMs are taking this slot at stake. Still many devices include a place for micro SD cards in them. Having a micro SD card slot doesn’t always make things easy. The hardest thing about having this slot is, finding the right microSD card for your Android device.  Has it ever happened to you that you bought a microSD card in rush but later found the card to be not compatible with your device? Sometimes, the card might be compatible at first. But later when you tried using the card as the storage\xa0location in your phone’s camera app, an error pops up. Or sometimes, there was no error while taking pictures and videos of lower resolutions but the error pops up right when you tried taking burst photos, full HD videos or live videos. These kinds of errors occur when the card you chose happen to be the wrong one.  To find out the right microSD card for your device, you need to know few key elements about microSD cards. The first thing to do is to find out whether your device supports microSD cards or not. If it does, check for the highest capacity of card it supports. If you check the manual of your smartphone, there you might find few  markings  that you might find confusing. In this article, I would like\xa0to clarify those key elements about any microSD card that you should know before buying a new card for your daily driver.        What’s the difference between micro SDHC and SDXC?  Well, the actual difference in micro SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) and SDXC (Secure Digital Extended Capacity is simply the amount of data they can store. The highest possible storage capacity in micro SDHC cards is of 32GB whereas micro SDXC cards have the capacity ranging from 32GB to 2TB. Before buying a card, make sure about the compatibility between the card and phone, many low-end phones don’t support micro SDXC cards.  What does ‘class’ on microSD card signify?  In simple words, a class on a microSD card signify the minimum rate at which data may be written to or read from the card. Hence, the minimum data transfer rate of class 2 cards is 2MBps whereas that of class 10 cards is 10MBps. Remember, this is just minimum transfer rate, some top quality cards may have much faster data transfer rates. That is why all class 10 cards might not be priced the same.  What does it mean by ‘UHS’ on microSD card?  It is from 2009 that even the microSD cards have become UHS-1 or UHS-3 compatible. Though UHS cards can hit up to the data transfer rates of 312 MBps theoretically, no smartphone has been engineered to fully support the UHS standard. Hence, current UHS microSD cards can only perform data transfers at minimum data transfer rates and that is, 10 MBps and 30 MBps for UHS – I class 1 and UHS – I class 3, respectively.  How to read information written on a microSD card?  \xa0  The microSD card type (SDHC or SDXC) and the storage capacity (in GB or TB) are easy to read out from the labels on the card.\xa0The three-speed classes mentioned above have logos to signify their minimum speed. Class 10 is the letter C with the number 10 inside. UHS-1 Class 1 and Class 3 are the letter U with a 1 or 3 inside, respectively. Finally, you may also see a\xa0I or II label on the card, which references a UHS bus speed.  Conclusion:\xa0  Now, you can easily make senses out of all the markings on a microSD card. Therefore, finding the card’s compatibility to your phone won’t be much of a cumbersome task. But remember, it is always wise to go for cards from reputable industries like Samsung, Sandisk, Transcend and the like. When you buy cards at cheaper prices, the quality can’t be assured. So, it is better to spend few more hundred for genuine ones over non-genuine ones. The cheaper the card, more likely it is to get corrupted.  So do you use a microSD card on your phone? If you do, which one are you currently been using? How much did you pay for it? Has it ever happened to you that your card got corrupted or stopped working without a reason?

['Understanding Smartphones Screen Technology'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['December 4, 2016']",2016-12-04 09:03:02+00:00,"['Smartphones are riddled with specs. When we\xa0concentrate our attentions on RAM, ROM, camera and battery while buying a smartphone, we often fail to grasp the type of screen technology used. However, we spend most of our time in smartphone gazing over the screen. So, to drop the concept of screen technology in your knowledge box, we have mentioned the most used screen technologies.  TFT (thin film transistor) LCD  The main component used for the display is LCD (liquid crystal display). When electric charges run through LCD, it changes its shape and optical qualities. This change moderates the amount of light that passes through the liquid crystal gate. So, for the displays, an object is embedded to the liquid crystal gate, which controls the amount of electric charge. In this screen technology, transistors are used and hence they are called TFT (thin film transistor) LCD.  TFT LCD display is cheaper to manufacture and is mostly used in budget phones, feature phones, and low-end smartphones.  This type of screen is cheaper to manufacture and is mostly used in budget phones, feature phones, and low-end smartphones. TFT displays offer better quality and higher resolution as compared to conventional LCD displays. However, they lack wide viewing angle and the visibility is poor in the direct light or sunlight. TFT displays devour the power juices and hence are not battery friendly.        IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD  This technology was introduced by Hitachi in the mid-nineties with a view to replacing conventional Twisted Nematic (TN) display. This type of screen technology is quite advanced as compared to TFT technology. It differs to TFT screen in the matter of arrangement of liquid crystals and transistors. IPS displays have inbuilt color reproduction technology because of which more natural colors can be observed. They also offer wide viewing angle. Colour reproduction and wide viewing angle in IPS LCD is because of a proper arrangement of polarizers and crystal orientation. In addition, IPS LCD consumes low power ensuring the longevity of the battery. As the quality of the screen ascends here, the cost has also been increased abreast. So, IPS LCDs are generally installed in mid-range and high-end smartphones.  IPS LCDs are generally installed in mid-range and high-end smartphones.  IPS-NEO LCD  Japan Display Inc. (JDI) takes the credits of the commencement of IPS-NEO LCD displays for mobile devices. IPS-NEO displays are characterized by higher contrast displays and consistent color reproduction through wide viewing angles. In NEO displays, there is no absolute loss in Image quality even viewing through different angles. The photo-alignment method used in IPS-NEO uses highly transmissive liquid crystal, traditionally regarded as difficult in mass production. Consequently, transmissivity increased around 10%, which contributed to reduced power consumption.  Huawei P9 features a 5.2-inch 1080P IPS-NEO display.  PLS (Plane to Line Switching) LCD  With the view to surpassing Hitachi’s IPS LCD screen technology, Samsung brought PLS LCD. Samsung installed PLS LCDs on its devices since with AMOLED screens there were difficulties in the past on realizing full HD resolution on mobile devices. PLS displays have similar features, specs and characteristics to the IPS displays. However, Samsung claimed that PLS displays have increased image quality, improved viewing angle, 10% increase in brightness and 15% decrease in production cost and increased flexibility as compared to IPS displays.  Samsung introduces PLS LCD in their latest midrange phones, J5 Prime and J7 Prime.  Super LCD  After the improvement in TFT LCD, super LCD or SLCD was developed. However, it could not meet the level of IPS LCD. SLCD Corporation conceived the idea of SLCD and developed it, though the HTC devices mostly use it. HTC One M7 and M8 are the practical examples of it. While installing on any smartphone, SLCD lacks the air gap between the display and the outer glass. This prevents the users from glare and makes them feel closer to the display itself. Dejected with the power consumption and visibility of TFT LCD, enhancement was done to provide low power consumption and wide-angle visibility in SLCD screen technology. It is renowned for consuming comparatively low power while displaying lighter colors like the white background found on most internet pages. SLED screens are great, yet in the comparison, IPS LCDs dominate them.  SuperLCD displays are mostly found in the HTC M-series smartphones.  OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)  It is a flat light emitting technology, made by placing a series of organic thin films between two conductors. Moreover, this assembly is sandwiched between two glasses layer. The upper layer of the glass plate is called seal and the lower layer of the glass plate is called substrate.  When an electric pulse is applied between two conducting sheets, an electro-luminescent light is produced. The color, brightness, and intensity of this light depend on the amount of electric pulse applied. OLEDs do not require backlight since they are self-luminous. Because of this, they are thin, consume less power and are superior to LCD displays. Since OLEDs are self-luminous, they do not require power to display a black screen. OLEDs also have improved image quality – better contrast, higher brightness, fuller viewing angle, wider color range, and faster refresh rate. In addition, OLEDs are durable and can operate in a wider temperature range.  AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode)  It is a hybrid\xa0display\xa0technology, which pairs the active matrix backplane from a traditional TFT display with an\xa0OLED\xa0display. In an AMOLED, the additional layer of the semiconducting film included behind the OLED panel allows it to activate each pixel more quickly. The increased speed makes it ideal for larger, higher definition displays with lots of pixels. In fact, it is as much as 1000 times faster than LCD. AMOLED is a type of OLED screen so it possesses similar attributes to OLED. \xa0Like OLEDs, AMOLEDs have brilliant color reproduction, lightweight, better battery life, higher brightness, sharpness, and lightweight designs.   Super AMOLED display  They are the even advanced version of AMOLED developed by Samsung. In the Super AMOLED screen, Samsung has been able to integrate touch sensitivity. As a result, the screen gets thinner, lighter, more touch sensitive and less power-hungry. In addition, without that extra layer, it is also far less reflective than a typical AMOLED screen, making it easier to view in bright sunlight. Moreover, with Super AMOLED displays, the actual display and the digitizer are attached, together. It results in an enhanced viewing experience due to no air gap.  SuperAMOLED displays are mostly found in Samsung phones.  Optics AMOLED  Optics AMOLED display is used in the OnePlus 3 smartphone. Explaining about the Optic AMOLED screen, OnePlus had mentioned the following:-  “Our stunning 5.5” Optic AMOLED display produces colours that are more vivid and true-to-life than ever before. A series of custom-engineered gamma corrections create a more natural viewing experience, while a dual-polarizing layer ensures ideal clarity, even in the brightest sunlight. The end result? Deep blacks, bright whites, and authentic colour reproduction – all at a fraction of the power consumption. It’s the smarter smartphone display.”  Later, the co-founder of OnePlus Carl Pei tried to explain that an Optic AMOLED is a variant of a Super AMOLED display and the company has adjusted the color tone of the display through software changes. These changes made the Optics AMOLED screen similar to a Super AMOLED screen. However, the company has claimed the display to be extremely vibrant and appearance to be thoroughly bright when using in outside in broad daylight. In addition, the company focuses on longer battery life as well through this particular display type.  Optics AMOLED display is used in the OnePlus 3 smartphone.  Retina display  Retina display is the marketing term used by Apple to refer the screen, which has a high pixel density of 300 PPI or above. With this pixel density, an individual will be unable to detect the pixels at a normal viewing distance. Apple converts a device’s display into Retina display by doubling the pixels vertically and horizontally. At the end, the Retina display receives four times more pixels than the non-retina counterpart does. So there is no doubt to have great screen experience being with the Retina display. With the passage of time, other smartphones have upgraded their pixel density to 500 PPI and above. However, iPhone has not made such improvements. From the manufacture of iPhone 4 to iPhone 7, the pixel density on the screen remains consistent with the magic number 326 per inch.  From the manufacture of iPhone 4 to iPhone 7, the pixel density on the screen remains consistent with the magic number 326 per inch.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Understanding-Smartphones-Screen-Technology.png']

['Qumi Q3 Plus Review: Best Portable Projector You Can Buy in Nepal?'],"['Projector', 'Reviews']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['November 30, 2016']",2016-11-30 09:06:01+00:00,"['A leading manufacturer of portable projectors, Vivitek has announced its entry into the Nepali market with an ultra-portable smart LED projector – the  Qumi Q3 Plus . It is currently available at the Evo Store for a discounted introductory offer of Rs. 59,000 (Rs. 65,000 otherwise). So, is this projector worth buying for this expensive pricing? Let’s find out.  DESIGN  The design is one of the strongest points of the Vivitek Qumi Q3 Plus. Weighing at just 460gm, the device is 6.9-inch long. In addition, it is ultra-portable and easy to carry around.  It is coated with high-quality plastic on all sides and is comfortable to hold. On the back, the device features a power button, a charging port, a micro SD card slot, an HDMI port, dual USB ports and a headphone jack. A lens for projecting sits at the front along with dual speaker grills. I really liked how Vivitek has made the dual speaker grills appear as if it were just one. There is also a sliding lens cover for lens protection. There is an adjustable stand to support the device at the bottom. There is also a ‘nail port’ to attach the projector to a stand. I used a tripod for this and it worked quite well.         For me, the only downside of the device is its lack of zoom lever. Yes, the picture adjusts itself on a surface, but you’ll need to place the device at a few meters distance to get the best quality picture.  DISPLAY OF THE PROJECTION  The display is another area where the Qumi Q3 Plus excels. According to its specs, the device features a native resolution of 720p with a maximum supported resolution of 1080p. With a contrast ratio of 5000:1 and brightness at 500 lumens, the projection is really bright and of high quality. It is eye pleasing, lively with the color reproduction being terrific. You can toggle the brightness, contrast and sharpness, and select options like Movie mode, Presentation mode, etc.   SOFTWARE  The projector runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. The software component of the device is simple and lag free. Although the radio signal sensor was weak, I could easily navigate through the internet, and stream videos comfortably. It also has another connectivity option – the Bluetooth.   The device comes with some useful apps like Miracast, Happycast, WPS Office, etc. It has an Appstore that contains plenty of apps of various categories.  PERFORMANCE  Under the hood, the Qumi Q3 Plus is powered by a 1.5 GHz Quad-core processor. When I used the device, it didn’t lag or underperform. However, it did suffer stutters sometimes when I cast my phone, but it was something I could ignore.  The area around the lens heats up after using the device for 10-20 minutes and gets very hot after an hour. Even when charging, the area around the charging port gets heated.   HARDWARE  The device has 5.32GB of on-board storage that can be expanded via an external microSD card. The dual speaker grills on the back are average in a quiet setting. So, I suggest the buyers get a set of speakers if you want to play audio.  BATTERY  The device is backed by a huge 8000mAh battery, and the company claims that it lasts 2 hours after it’s fully charged. When I used it, it gave me a playback time of around 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 40 minutes. The usage included a projection of HD video via the HDMI cable and through an external drive.   CONCLUSION  There are lots of non-branded projectors in Nepal whose price start from little over Rs. 5,000. They work, but unlike the Qumi Q3 Plus, you’ll be disappointed with their performance, resolution, and other functions. Ergo, if you want a top-notch projector, at home or at work, this device is definitely for you because there’s not a better device at its price with all its functions.']",[]
['Internet Service Providers in Nepal – the illusion of choices'],['Opinion'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['November 29, 2016']",2016-11-29 12:06:34+00:00,"['The necessity of the Internet has climbed a steep curve in recent years. Most of the households have an Internet connection, at least in the major cities of Nepal. Even the remote places of Nepal have access to the Internet thanks to so many Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nepal. According to the Internet Service Provider’s Association of Nepal (ISAN), there is  30 registered ISP in Nepa l .  With so many Internet Service Providers in Nepal plus the choices they give, you have so many options to choose from or wait…do you really? Let’s look at how your ISPs are not giving you what they say.  First, let me tell you  the difference between Mbps and MBps .        Mbps vs MBps  Firstly, the major difference between Mbps and MBps is the letter “b” and “B” where  b  stands for bit and  B  stands for byte. That means  Mbps  stands for Megabits per second and  MBps  stands for Megabyte per second.  And, 8 bit = 1 Byte.  The other difference is Mbps measures Internet download/upload speed while MBps measures file transfer speed. So, if you have an Internet connection speed of 1Mbps, it doesn’t mean you can download a 1MB file in 1 sec. So how long will it take for me to download 1 MB file with 1Mbps speed? It will take you 8 seconds because…1 bit = 1/8 Byte. I Hope, you can now calculate the actual time it will take for you to download a file on your Internet speed.  [socialpoll id=”2403796″] Okay, now that you know the difference between Mbps and MBps, let’s look into what your ISP is not telling you when you subscribe to them.  The choices of Plans:   The major ISPs of Nepal like Classic Tech, NTC, Subisu, Vianet, Worldlink offers various services like Wireless Internet, Cable Internet, FTTH (Fiber To The Home), WiMax, ADSL under different promotional names. They also offer their customers various plans from limited volume based packs to “unlimited” Internet services. With so many options, things can get confusing for you. Well, I am here to help. Let’s look at what you can expect from volume-based plans and unlimited plans.    Limited Volume Based Plan    This plan is specially provided for  fiber connections by most of the ISP’s . In this plan, the Internet companies give you much higher speed upto certain bandwidth and then reduce the speed significantly after you cross the bandwidth limit. Let’s look at the few plans offered by major ISPs of Nepal.  P.S. keep the difference between B and b (the one we talked about above) in mind.  Classic Tech :  Classic Tech offers 15Mbps or 30Mbps limited Internet. You get 530GB\xa0 of data in the 15Mbps plan and 660 GB in the 30Mbps plan. However, remember that these data caps are for 3months. The company also doesn’t say how much data can we use per month. Of course, you can still use the Internet if you run out of the allocated data but the speed will fall back to…company haven’t written the fallback speed on their website.  Subisu:  Subisu offers 5Mbps, 10Mbps, 25Mbps and 50Mbps with various data packs depending on the speed and the validity period of your subscription. The fallback speed is 512Kbps for 5Mbps and 10Mbps users, 2 Mbps for 25Mbps users and 5 Mbps for 50Mbps users. But, wait, don’t get excited by these numbers, there is FUP and sharing ratio (we will talk about it later).  Vianet:  5, 10 or 15Mbps plans are offered by Vianet under different names like PRO, PLUS, and RUSH. The data limit depends on the number of months you subscribe and the speed of your connection. Well, what is the speed after you cross the limit? 512Kbps for both 5Mbps and 10Mbps and 640 Kbps for 15Mbps (the FUP and sharing ratio apply).  Worldlink:  There is 5, 10, 15, 25 and 50Mbps speed options for volume-based Internet by Worldlink. Again, like other companies, the data limit depends on the number of months you subscribe and the speed of your connection. The fallback speed varies with the starting speed:\xa0 256 Kbps for 5Mbps, 384 Kbps for 10Mbps, 512 Kbps for 15Mbps, 768 Kbps for 25Mbps and 1.5 Mbps for 50 Mbps (the FUP and sharing ratio apply).  Now, let’s look at “unlimited” speed plans before moving to the FUP and sharing ratio.    \xa0Unlimited Plan    Besides volume based pack, you can also choose unlimited plans from many ISPs like NTC’s ADSL. Worldlink offers 5Mbps Unlimited plan, Classic tech offers 1Mbps and 6 Mbps unlimited plan while Vianet and Subisu don’t seem to have a separate unlimited option.  So which plan should you choose? Well, it depends on the requirements. To tell the truth, in my opinion, you do not have any choice, what companies are offering is merely an  illusion of choices . Because, if you choose limited, your internet speed slows down after you reach the capped limit; whereas, if you choose the unlimited speed you will be subjected to FUP from the very beginning. Not to forget, the sharing ratio applies in both of the plans.  The Fair Use Policy (FUP):  The name Fair Use Policy looks like a good thing because according to ISPs, with FUP average Internet users will get justice; but do they? The policy started so that heavy users didn’t fill up the available bandwidth and hence, other average users on the network could get a better Internet experience. This sounds cool if ISPs could keep pace with the growing Internet need.  The problem with FUP today is that  the need of “average” users  has increased today.\xa0 A user according to ISP is one household. Now, think of it. A few years ago one household had one computer so Intenet bandwidth needed by a user would be low. However, today most of the households have more than one computer and also there are mobiles, tablets, smartTVs so “a user” uses more bandwidth than they used to. In addition to this, the Internet no longer has only texts. An average user today needs to access multimedia files that consume more bandwidth. This means the average user of the past has become a heavy user today. Thus, FUP results in slower Internet experience for everyone.  The Sharing Ratio:  One thing ISPs don’t say explicitly to their subscribers is the sharing ratio of your Internet speed. Every home users have to share an IP with other households. Generally, the sharing ratio is 1:8 or 1:4 in Nepal which means if you have subscribed to 1Mbps of Internet you get 128Kbps if the sharing ratio is 1:8 and 256Kbps if the ratio is 1:4. If you are a business, you can ask for dedicated IP (which is not shared, but I doubt).  With all these plans, FUP, sharing ratios, hidden costs, and bad customer services from ISPs, all I can conclude is: are we getting what is advertised? Do we (the users) have real choices? or everything is an illusion of choice?  We will do a separate post about what things to look at before choosing an Internet connection in the future.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ISP-in-nepal.png']
"['Scientists Turn Nuclear Waste into Clean, Long Lived Diamond Batteries']",[],['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['November 29, 2016']",2016-11-29 11:11:52+00:00,"['Nuclear waste had always been a pain in the neck, lacking a safe way of disposal. However, with the new discovery, our perception to nuclear waste will be changed. Nuclear waste will now no longer be a headache to the environment. The physicists and chemists from the University of Bristol developed a man-made diamond, which could generate a small electric current when placed in a radioactive field. The named this discovery as ‘diamond battery’. The researchers assumed that with the diamond battery, the nuclear waste could take the form of clean energy source.   “There are no moving parts involved, no emissions generated and no maintenance required, just direct electricity generation,” Said professor of materials Tom Scott. “By encapsulating radioactive material inside diamonds, we turn a long-term problem of nuclear waste into a nuclear-powered battery and a long-term supply of clean energy.”   Electrical energy is often generated by the relative motion between coil and magnet or magnetic field. However, in this method, there will be no motion involved and no emission generated. Just with an enclosure of short-range radioactive material inside a man-made diamond, we can generate a small electric charge. The diamonds themselves are radioactive, so they are given a second non-radioactive diamond coating to act as a radiation shield. Due to the blockade of radiation, the generation of electric charge takes place.  The researchers first used Nickel-63 isotope as a radiation source to develop a prototype for demonstration. However, in order to improve the efficiency of the diamond battery, they are now working on Carbon-14. Carbon-14 is a radioactive version of carbon, which is found on graphite blocks, used for moderating the nuclear reaction.         “Carbon-14 was chosen as a source material because it emits a short-range radiation, which is quickly absorbed by any solid material,” Dr. Neil Fox explained. “This would make it dangerous to ingest or touch with your naked skin, but safely held within the diamond, no short-range radiation can escape. In fact, diamond is the hardest substance known to man, there is literally nothing we could use that could offer more protection.”   The diamond battery offers low power as compared to conventional batteries. However, the longevity of the diamond battery is incomparable; it can last for thousands of years. It was mentioned that the diamond battery with Carbon-14 would take approximately 5730 years to reach 50-percent power. With the low amount of power generation, the diamond battery could not surpass the conventional batteries. However, it suits in the places where low power is required and charging or replacing of convention batteries is challenging. The obvious places can be a pacemaker, satellites, high-altitude drones or even spacecraft.  The discovery sound pretty amazing, however, the practical application of diamond battery does not seem feasible. The most conspicuous problem encountered would be the cost since the diamond is expensive. The use diamonds to develop a low power battery does not sound witty. However, with this discovery, nuclear waste will no longer sit there posing a threat to humanity.']",[]

['Galaxy J7 Prime Review: Samsung’s Newest Premium Midranger'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Santo Pok -  '],"['November 28, 2016']",2016-11-28 11:24:16+00:00,"['Just after 5 months from the release of the  Galaxy J7 2016 , Samsung released the third iteration of the J7. It was obviously a sad moment for those who bought J7 2016 to find out that their new device got older much before they could realize. Was this iteration a need of time? Has this successor brought remarkable new changes to the table? In this full review of Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime, we are digging deep to find out if the latest J7 is really the greatest J7.  Samsung Galaxy On Nxt Latest Price: Rs. 19,990 [Last updated on: December 6, 2018]  Design:  The most immediate difference that anyone will easily notice is the phone’s full metal unibody design. This phone certainly feels and looks premium this time around. The dimensions of the phone are pretty identical to its predecessors. Though it’s the first metal phone in J7 line up, it has managed to be 3 grams lighter than the plastic made J7 2016. The phone weighs only 167gm.              1  of 3                                                The remarkable change in the design language is the new placement of loudspeaker in the right top corner of the phone. In the same right edge, the power button is placed below the speaker. The volume toggles are on the top left side of the device. Below them are the micro sd card and dual nano sim trays. The back of the device has cleaner look. There’s a 13-megapixel camera lens along with a led flash in the center of top back. In the bottom of the device, headphone jack can be found to the right of the micro USB port. The mic is placed at a left bottom edge. On the top front, there’s 8-megapixel selfie camera to the left and proximity sensors to the right of the earpiece. The fingerprint sensor is placed at the center of the bottom which doubles as the home bottom and recent and back buttons are placed on its either sides.   Those upgrading from earlier J7s might find this device a little slipper as compared to its predecessors which used to have a matte finish.  Display:  The J7 Prime comes with a 5.5-inch Full-HD IPS LCD display with a 1080×1920 pixels resolution which roughly translates to 401 ppi pixel density. This is the first J7 phone that rocks a full HD resolution. The white balance of the display seems to be in the right scale this time as compared to the warmer white balance of its predecessors. Though its an LCD, the display is still pretty sharp and offers great viewing angles. The display has good color reproduction. The brightness is sufficient enough to lit the display even in outdoors. The brightness when lowered to its least, does soothe the eyes while using the device before bed at night.\xa0The phone lacks an ambient light sensor like all the Samsung J-series of smartphones, hence the brightness level have to be adjusted manually.   Software UI:  The J7 Prime runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow-based TouchWiz UI. It is still isn’t good as the stock one\xa0but lately, Samsung is trying really hard to cut down on bloat or unwanted apps. It’s an appreciable effort from Samsung and may be someday TouchWiz will be good enough to get more love than hate. The two new features are now available exclusively in this new device : S power planner and S secure. The former one helps the user to get the best out of last minute juice from its battery and the latter one gives the facility to secure files, folders, and apps. The another good thing about the ‘S Secure’ feature is that same app can be cloned in S Secure and the user can use two facebook, viber or any other apps right in the same phone. The phone is getting timely Android Security patches and which is just too sweet.        1  of 5                                                                    Performance and Battery Life:  The Galaxy J7 Prime houses\xa0a 1.6GHz octa-core Exynos 7870 processor which is the same as that of J7 2016 but the RAM is now of 3GB. The phone comes with a memory capacity of 32GB of internal storage which is further expandable by up to 256GB via microSD card. Dual nano sims and sd card can be used without any compromise since they have dedicated slot for all three of them. The 3300 mAh battery seems to be a perfect match here. The phone provides\xa0dope battery life. Even in hardcore usage, I managed to get 6 hours plus screen on time.      Benchmark Scores   1  of 3                                                The processor made by Samsung itself is quite powerful, and yet is an efficient one. The app switching is relatively fast. The phone handles easily no matter what games we throw at it. Yes, few stutters here and there were noticed but that is more likely due to the TouchWiz, and not due to the hardware configuration. This is one of the best mid-range processors available. The phone doesn’t heat up in a way like you should stop using it. A little of heat is just acceptable. The already good battery life can be easily elongated with the power saving features that comes with the device.   The side firing mono speaker is pretty loud and much clear with little or no distortion even at peak volumes. Like any other mid-range phones, the phone doesn’t support the fast charging, though.  Camera:  The J7 Prime has the same rear shooter as in J7 2016 that is a 13 megapixel one with 28mm focal length, f1.9 aperture, and a LED flash. However, while judging the pictures of both the phone, J7 Prime’s pictures had natural colors as opposed to little-saturated ones from J7 2016. The camera software hasn’t changed much but has included an additional Night mode. This primary shooter with auto-focus can shoot a 1080p (full HD) video at 30 fps.       The front facing shooter, however, has got a Megapixel upgrade and now sports 8 Megapixel one instead of 5 megapixels. There is no selfie flash on this unit as opposed to J7 2016. But don’t get upset, the display triggers flash by itself while taking selfies in low light. However, those selfies in low light come with lots of noise in them. But selfies taken at good lighting condition happen to be a well-detailed one.   Conclusion:  Well, Now we can certainly say that the latest J7 is really the greatest J7 so far. The phone looks well built and has the improvements worth considering. The phone is premium, powerful but a bit pricey at Rs. 29,450. J7 was considered to be an affordable device but J7 Prime is priced at a little more than affordable price range. With that being, if you pay for this device, you would certainly won’t be disappointed. The full HD display of 1080p is certainly the charm of this device.   Since it’s 2016 and no phone is secure as the one with fingerprint sensor along with S Secure feature right from the box. The phone performs as good as it sounds on the paper. Top of all, the battery life you’re gonna get, is certainly gonna surprise you. While using the device, I personally wished if the power button and volume toggles were placed a little lower so that I didn’t have to stretch my fingers to reach them. The absence of sensors like gyroscope and magnetometer are certainly gonna disappoint those who are into VR Gaming and 360 videos. Plus, the need for manual adjustment of the brightness while going out and coming back home was just a hectic thing to do. This phone is for those who doesn’t mind spending a little more for a mid-ranger phone which looks as classy as the flagship ones.']",[]
['Leagoo Smartphones Goes Official in Nepal'],[],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['November 28, 2016']",2016-11-28 10:05:11+00:00,"['It’s a good thing that many globally recognized Chinese smartphone manufacturers are jumping right in, one after another in Nepali Markets. Currently, the Chinese companies like Gionee, Oppo, Xiaomi, Huawei and others are found to be doing already good in the market. They are found to be expanding their presence in the market share every single day. In this scenario, a new Chinese company to launch its smartphones can be considered as a good news. Shree Shyam Bhadhur Pvt. Ltd, the subsidiary company of JSS group, has unveiled a new set of smartphones from the LEAGOO on November 25th. 11 new models from four different series of LEAGOO smartphones were launched that day.  LEAGOO is a star brand owned by Shenzhen OTEDA Technology Co., Ltd, that was set up on April 2014 and thereafter started to manufacture smartphones, smartphone accessories, and wearables. The LEAGOO phones are getting a warm welcome from many different countries for producing quality products at cheaper prices.  After taking a thorough look at what LEAGOO and its devices are offering, we were pretty impressed to see features like fast fingerprint scanners, fast focusing cameras, quick charging and even shock proof \xa0and bullet proof glass in many of its products. The 11 phones that are initially released happen to be from four different series of smartphones from LEAGOO namely, Z-Series, Shark-Series, M-Series, and T-Series. The best thing about phones from LEAGOO is, all phones support both WCDMA and GSM networks. All LEAGOO phones pack lithium-polymer batteries that are relatively light but have worse energy densities as compared to lithium-ion batteries.\xa0        Z-Series | Leagoo:\xa0  The Z series smartphones are for the ones who are upgrading from a bar phone to smartphones and have a limited budget. The cheapest phone from LEAGOO is, the Z1 which costs only NRs. 5,700 but comes with the specs of 2011 which seems obvious looking at its price tag. The best available phone in Z-Series is the Z5 LTE which supports upto 4G network and costs only NRs. 9,999. But, if you are the one who is into specs, you probably don’t wanna consider any phones from Z-Series at all.\xa0    Z1 – NRs. 5,700  :  4-inch FWVGA, 512MB RAM, 8GB ROM, 1.3GHz Quad Core Processor, Camera (3MP and 2MP), Battery 1400mAh, GPS, Bluetooth, FM, WiFi, 3G network  Z3C –\xa0NRs. 6,150  :  4.5-inch, IPS LCD multi-touch, 512MB RAM, 8GB ROM (32GB expandable), 1.3GHz Quad Core Processor, Camera (2MP and 2MP), Battery 1800mAh, GPS, Bluetooth, FM, WiFi, 2G,3G network dual sim  Z5 – NRs. 7,199  :  5-inch FWVGA, 1GB RAM, 8GB ROM (32GB expandable), 1.3GHz Quad Core Processor, Camera (5MP w/ flash and 2MP), Battery 2300mAh, GPS, Bluetooth, FM, WiFi, WCDMA/GSM network  Z5 LTE (4G)- NRs. 9,999  :  5-inch FWVGA, 1GB RAM, 8GB ROM (32GB expandable), 1.3GHz Quad Core Processor, Camera (5MP w/ dual flash and 2MP), Battery 2300mAh, GPS, Bluetooth, FM, WiFi, WCDMA/GSM network dual sim   Shark Series | Leagoo  If you are among the ones who buy a phone looking at the battery capacity then you might be sold on 5000mAH battery packed in SHARK 1 LITE which is priced at Rs. 13,799. This phone supports OTG and power sharing so you’ll certainly be able to lend some juice to other devices as well.   SHARK 1 LITE – NRs. 13,799  :  5-inch HD IPS, 1GB RAM, 8GB ROM (32GB expandable), 1.3GHz Quad Core Processor, Camera (13MP w/ flash and 8MP), Battery 5000mAh, GPS, Bluetooth, FM, WiFi, WCDMA/GSM network dual sim\xa0  M Series | Leagoo  The M series consist of 3 models: M5, M5+, and M8. The phone from LEAGOO that most of the salesman will be pitching is certainly the shock-proof M5 which is said to survive from being crushed by SUV. This HD 5-incher IPS LCD display with 2.5D bullet proof and shockproof glass costs only NRs. 11,999. For a phone in this price range to have a fingerprint sensor is certainly surprising, but it is yet to see if that’s operationally useful or not. This phone seems to be priced right with the specs like 1.3GHz QuadCore processor, 2 GB RAM, 16GB ROM(128GB expandable), Android 6.0, fingerprint sensor, Camera (rear 8MP w/ flash, front 5MP) and 2300 mAh battery.   Along with M5, there are other two phones in M-Series namely M8 and M5+ which have 5.7 and 5.5-inch HD display respectively. M8 has fast charging and M5+ is a shock proof one. These phones are priced at NRs. 15,499 and NRs. 16,599. Both the phones have 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM (128GB expandable), 1.3GHz processor and fingerprint sensor in common. The M8 has a 3340mAh battery as opposed to 2500mAh of M5+.

Golden 1000 days  is a campaign introduced by UNICEF with the primary goal to bring a change in the lifestyle of pregnant mothers and children below two years of age such that there is a visible reduction in child and maternal\xa0mortality rate. This initiative strives to increase awareness about the importance of the first 1000 days in a child’s life, ultimately reducing the maternal and child mortality through improved health and nutritional status of pregnant and lactating mothers as well as young children. Understanding the complications, necessities, and requirements of a mother and a child in the 1000 days between a woman’s pregnancy and her child’s second birthday offers\xa0a unique opportunity to shape a healthier and more prosperous future for the entire family.  The Golden 1000 Days Code Camp 2016 offered an array of opportunities to student developers, designers, programmers and tech professionals to team up and put forward innovative ideas to achieve the primary goal of UNICEF’s mission. Designers, developers, strategists, IT Professionals and project managers who want to make a difference through technology gathered and worked in harmony to develop many innovative ideas on how to engage youths in the pre-natal and post-natal process.        With 120 participants, the Code Camp commenced on 15th November. The introduction session began at 10:55 AM with Mr. Allen Bailochan Tuladhar, Executive Chairperson of the Em Found, addressing the participants with a mantra: “ Victory is in our veins “. He welcomed and motivated the participants by letting them know about the impact that this project would create upon completion: 400,000 mothers would be benefiting from the webapp that will be developed during the code camp. The app developed by the youth for the welfare of women and children would be owned and implemented by the Government of Nepal. He also focused on the fact that how without the active participation of the youth, this innovative solution would never come to play. The participants were then divided into multiple teams and each team had a mentor from the different fields available – such as Health Expert, Business Technology Expert, Industry Expert.  Mr. Badri Bahadur Khadka, Director of NHEICC, Ministry Of Health(Nepal) put forward his best wishes for the camp and  Mr.  Rudrajit Das, Chief Communication For Development (UNICEF) also highlighted that\xa0innovation shouldn’t be for oneself but it should for the sake of humanity.\xa0Mr. Kunj Prasad Joshi, Health Administrative Officer,Nepal, gave a presentation on the Health and Nutrition Status of Nepal.\xa0Ms. Bonita Sharma gave a presentation about the major problems faced in child and maternal health in Nepal.\xa0        1  of 4                                                          On day 2, the participants were all invited to be creative and put forward innovative ideas to help develop a better, healthy environment for mothers and children. The participants showed their\xa0determination and dedication by designing, creating and coding their ideas. The teams were also provided with guidelines to divide tasks among team members on topics such as User Interface, Application Programming Interface etc.  On day 3, the participants showcased their ideas in front of the jury and 10 teams got selected to continue with their ideas to make “ Golden 1000 days”  campaign a success. The teams took the suggestions given by the jury and implemented them to their ideas to bring out an excellent result.  On day 4, the final ten teams were divided into 3 different groups: asp.net group, WordPress group, and app group. The teams were to integrate the solutions generated the day before according to their respective groups.\xa0The solutions discovered during the 4 days Code Camp will be used as a foundation by the IT interns at MIC to create the final product.  The Code Camp did not only brought together innovative ideas to make the “ Golden 1000 days”\xa0 a success   but also brought youths with different visions and backgrounds together and made them understand the necessity of maternal and child health care. The camp was a growing platform for the youths that not only let them code their way through the 4 days but also helped them build team spirit; interpersonal, individual skills and personality.  In a nutshell, the Code Camp conducted by EMFound, Nepal was a thoroughly successful event which upon completion,we believe, can obviously help drop maternal and child mortality rate.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Golden-1000-Days-Code-Camp-2016.jpg']

But, somewhere deep inside you, you don’t trust them because it’s “Chinese”. Well, the recent  report from Strategy Analytics , a Massachusetts, USA based company may boost your trust on them.  According to the report, Huawei is the most profitable android device manufacturer in the world in the third quarter of 2016. Vivo and Oppo (also Chinese manufacturers) trail Huawei in the list.  Although Samsung is still at the top in terms of volume of devices produced, other three Android device makers surpass in profit. This may be because of the exploding  Galaxy Note 7 fiasco  according to a representative of System Analytics.        In terms of overall operating profit, Apple leads the chart by a huge margin. Apple earned $8.5 billion in the third quarter of 2016. This is 91% of the total share in smartphones profits worldwide. However, new phones by Apple only make up about 20% of the global market. You know what this means? Apple phones are expensive.  Huawei follows Apple with $200 million (a 2.4% share). Vivo, Oppo, and Others (including Samsung) share an equal share of 2.2% with just under $200million operating profit. Although Samsung was not in the top list this quarter, Samsung is said to recover in the fourth quarter of 2016. That being said, the effort of the Chinese companies for making good phones should also be credited.\xa0 Especially since phones like  Huawei P9  got popular even outside Asia.   “Three of the world’s top four most profitable smartphone vendors are currently Chinese. Huawei, Vivo, and Oppo have not only improved their smartphone product line-ups this year, they have also enhanced their operational abilities and kept a tight lid on expanding distribution costs,” said Strategy Analytics director Linda Sui.   Now, talking about the Nepali market, Samsung leads the market share here. About 60 percent of the smartphones sold in Nepal are from Samsung, 10% are from Huawei, 8% from Gionee and remaining from other manufacturers.

That is approximately 237,000 more units as compared to those imported in first three months of last fiscal year.  This increment can be considered to be a motivating factor to newly introduced mobile brands lately. In the ranking of most imported goods, telecommunication equipment happens to be in the ninth ranking. The sources claim 44.5 % increment in the import of total telecommunication equipment as compared to those of last year’s first trimester. Out of those, mobile units and their spare parts fall on the top of the list of that list.  This huge increment in import and selling of mobile units may be due to the emerging of new mobile brands in Nepal.

['Understanding Qualcomm Quick Charging Technology'],"['Android', 'Qualcomm', 'Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Bivek Khatiwada -  '],"['November 25, 2016']",2016-11-25 09:13:58+00:00,"['Previously, phones used to have fewer features. With fewer features, time of use of phone also used be less resulting in a slow drain of battery power. And the time required for charging the battery had not bothered us at all. But these days, powerful smartphones are available in the market supporting tons of features. Due to the inclusion of a multitude of features in the phones, time for its use also increased. With more features and more time of use, the battery in the smartphones started draining fast. To cope this problem, different manufacturers brought high capacity batteries. With the high capacity batteries, smartphones were fun to use as the battery lasted longer. However, with an increase in battery capacity, the time required to charge it also increased. In order to reduce charging time, quick charging technology was introduced.   Out in the market, we can hear turbo charging, adaptive fast charging, rapid charging, and Qualcomm Quick Charge. They puzzle us sometimes about the function they actually do. However, the real thing is that all of them are the same thing. They are based on the same licensed technology from Qualcomm known as quick charging technology.        “Quick charge” is just a marketing term for the capabilities of the power management circuitry in smartphones and wall-charger. Therefore, for an effective quick charging of your smartphone, both of your charger and smartphones must support Quick charging. For that, having a Qualcomm processor on your smartphone is not mandatory since\xa0Qualcomm has licensed the technology to non-Qualcomm smartphones like the Galaxy S7 (Exynos) and ZenFone 2 (Intel). The basic principle involved is, in quick charging technology, a high power is injected in your battery using higher-than-normal voltage until it reaches saturation, which is usually 60-80% charge depending on how the phone’s power management is configured. Here we have collected some released versions of quick charging brought by Qualcomm.  Quick Charge 1.0  Qualcomm brought the first version of quick charging technology in 2013 and named it Quick charge 1.0. \xa0The devices supporting Quick charge 1.0 charge up to 40% faster than the older phones. If a normal phone is stuck on charging for four hours or more, with this version on your phone you can have your battery full within a time span of three hours. However, the charging process will not be proportionate. The amount of time taken to charge from dead condition (0%) to 50% will not be equal to 50% to 100% because after a certain point known as “saturation”, the charging process slows down.  With this version on your system, the battery will be fed to a maximum power of 10 watts injected with a maximum voltage of 5 volts. This version is inbuilt with Qualcomm snapdragon 600 processor. The devices like Droid DNA by HTC,\xa0Samsung Galaxy S III,\xa0Nokia Lumia 920,Vodafone Smart ultra 6,\xa0Asus Padfone,\xa0LG Nexus 4, etc are accompanied by Quick charge 1.0.  Quick Charge 2.0  Revolutionizing charging technology with Quick charge 1.0, Qualcomm brought Quick charge 2.0 in 2014. The traditional battery charger is limited to 5 volts and less than 2 amperes and actual power received by the battery will be less than 8 watts, taking an account of the loss in charging circuitry and cables. According to Qualcomm, QC 2.0 is 50% faster than QC 1.0. In an official 30 minutes charge test between traditional charging, QC 1.0 and QC 2.0, a charge of 12%, 30%, and 60% was found respectively at the end of 30 minutes charging.   QC 2.0 works on the multi-voltage charging system offering 5V, 9V, and 12V and up to 3A of amperes of current feeding minimum power of 10 watts and maximum 18 watts to the battery. If there is a low charge on the battery, it offers to charge with 12V, which allows rapid charge and as the charge increases on the battery, charging voltage is decreased. It is backward compatible.  This version is available in snapdragon 200, 400, 410, 615, 800, 801, 805, 808 and 810 processors. QC 2.0 is found in Samsung Galaxy S7, Sony Xperia Z3, Xiaomi MI 4, LG V10, Google Nexus 6, etc.  Quick charge 3.0  The major change done by Qualcomm in QC 3.0 is that the normal charging in QC 2.0 in the range of 10 watts to 18 watts has been modified to a dynamic charging mode in which battery will be fed 3.6 volts to 20 volts range with a step size of 200 millivolts.   As the charge in the battery goes on increasing, the charging voltage decreases. In QC 2.0, if 9 volts is unacceptable then the supply voltage to the battery decreases to 5 volts but in QC 3.0, just a fall of 200 millivolts can be experienced and a fast charging can be achieved. This feature in QC 3.0 is called INOV (Intelligent Negotiation for Optimum Voltage), which allows for a fine-tuned power output and a more optimized charging cycle. QC 3.0 supported devices charges \xa0twice faster than QC 1.0 and is 38% more efficient than QC 2.0. This version also supports backward compatibility.  QC 3.0 is inbuilt in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430, 617, 618, 620, 820 processors.\xa0 The devices equipped with QC 3.0 are Asus ZenFone 3, HP Elite x3, LG V20 Xiaomi Mi 5, Xiaomi Mi 5s, Sony Xperia XZ, etc.  Quick charge 4  This version of Quick charging technology has not stepped on the market yet. However, Qualcomm unveiled its flagship SoC (system on chip) in this November, which supports Quick charge 4. Qualcomm has assured that QC4 will make its debut in its high-end SoC Snapdragon 835 in 2017.  QC 4 will have Dual-charge feature due to which charging will be up to 20% faster or 30% more efficient. Admitting the heating problem of the battery, Qualcomm promised that with QC 4, charging would be 5˚C cooler than QC 3.0. So along with an efficient and quick charging, you should not have to worry about your device heating up.   Qualcomm calls this new QC version as “five for five” claiming that a meager five minutes of charging would back you up for more than five hours. Qualcomm has claimed that, in the QC 4, there would be many enhancements in the features. QC 4 would be compatible with USB Type-C and USB Power Delivery (USB-PD). \xa0Battery saver feature is also added to the list, which enhances the battery life and ensures safety.  With so much from Qualcomm, a thrill has resided inside every tech freaks. However, to get a device equipped with QC 4, we are supposed to wait. To know more about Qualcomm’s QC 4, click  here .

['ZTE Axon Elite Review: Old But Gold'],"['Reviews', 'ZTE']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['November 25, 2016']",2016-11-25 08:19:31+00:00,"['Axon elite is the latest offering from ZTE Nepal though it has been out for more than a year now. Priced at Rs. 33,990, the metal-clad phone houses a dual camera setup as the centerpiece comes with a unique form factor. So let’s get a quick review of the ZTE Axon elite.  ZTE Axon elite comprises of unibody metal design. Visually the phone is a unique lad to look at, but personally, I didn’t like the fake leather covering on the back. The front houses a front firing speaker, but only the bottom portion actually works. It sports a 5.5-inch 1080p IPS LCD display and the display doesn’t disappoint at all. It has an excellent color reproduction and viewing angles, but the brightness level is not up there when compared to the flagships. The display is also protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.         Powering the phone is the last years Snapdragon 810 chipset which is clocked at 2 GHz along with Adreno 430 for graphical performance and 3GB RAM for multitasking. You might be worried about the Snapdragon 810 overheating issue, but I had no issues with the phone even during intense gaming, all thanks to its excellent cooling system. In terms of storage, it has 32GB ROM with microSD support upto 128GB.  The feature focus of the phone is its dual camera setup where the primary camera is 13MP and the secondary is 2MP, the latter is used for Bokeh effect on photos. If you are looking for the best camera phone at this price range, you will not regret buying the Axon Elite. UP front, the Axon elite has an 8MP camera with wide angle lens which is excellent for group selfies and video calling. The phone also comes with a fingerprint sensor on the back which works fine and unlocks the phone in less than a second. It is backed up with 3,000mAh battery and supports quick charge 2.0. The battery life is above average with around 4 hours of on screen time.  At Rs. 33,990, the phone punches well above its weight with an excellent display, flagship-level performance, and dual camera lens that works well. The only downside of the Axon Elite is it’s still running on older version of Lollipop 5.0.2 and will not receive any further updates.']",[]

['Understanding Smartphone Processor Cores'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['November 24, 2016']",2016-11-24 12:31:58+00:00,"['When handphones were first introduced, their primary function was to make communication over phone calls and messages possible. Gradual development in them resulted to the present day smartphones. The smartphones today are possible to send, receive emails; take, share pictures and videos; edit, save documents; play songs and videos and many more functions.  We can say that, now, with the advancement of science and technology, the whole world has come closer. We practically have access to the world community in our palms. From computers that would take up a whole room to desktops to laptops and palmtops, computing devices have gone through a lot of changes in their external features as well as in their internal attributes. Here, we are discussing about smartphones. Or rather specifically, about- the CPU/ processor present in the smartphones.  Every time that you see an advertisement or read a review of any smartphone, you see terms like- “Quad Core processor”, “Hexa Core processor” or “Octa Core processor”. What do they really mean? To understand those terms, you must first know what a processor really is.         First of all, what is a process? A  process  is a set of steps that one needs to follow to complete a task. To complete any task, one must follow a systematic process. A  processor  is responsible for handling the processes. Smartphones are highly advanced than simple handphones because they contain advanced processors inbuilt to them. A processor, basically speaking, is a CPU. Just like how computers contain CPU’s that are responsible for the overall functioning of the system, the processors in smartphones are responsible for the functioning of the phones. Here, we have  graphics processing unit (GPU), memory, peripheral buses as well as other sub-processors integrated on a single chip which is referred to as System-on-a-Chip (SoC) . This compactness of this CPU is what makes the smartphone’s sleek and classy.   Earlier, devices using only a single processor were developed. But with time, multi-core processors could be accommodated to a single device. This was the introduction of multi-core\xa0 processors.  However, one must understand that the presence of multi-core processors does not mean that the speed of execution of the processes increases. It means that the device is able to execute many processes at the same time, simultaneously.  A core is the main element of the processor that is responsible for executing all the operations. Multiple cores, for instance: dual core- two cores, quad core- four cores; means that the division of processes among the processors can be carried out broadly thus enabling the execution of multiple processes simultaneously.  Nevertheless, processors and multiple cores are not  the only aspects that affect the execution of the processes. Various other factors such capacity of the RAM, the capacity of the graphics card, network compatibility and much more are responsible for the justified usage of multi-core processors.   What is the big deal about having more cores powering our smartphones?  Does having a smartphone with octa-processor necessarily mean that your phone is more advanced than the phones with quad-core processors? During the functioning of octa-core processors,\xa0the lower-powered set of cores will be employed first. Only when the advanced tasks are to be done, however, the faster set of four cores will kick in.  It is evidently clear that the more powerful a CPU is, the more power it has to draw from a device’s battery. This poses a problem, given that smartphone battery technology hasn’t advanced at anywhere near the rate of mobile processor technology. Therefore, as smartphones have gotten more advanced, the battery life has plummeted.\xa0But the majority of smartphone tasks do not require much processing power. However, HD video, gaming, and photo manipulation most certainly do. And thus,\xa0the octa-core concept seems to be a practical way to lengthen a modern phone’s battery life without compromising performance where it matters.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/understanding-smartphone-processor-cores.png']
['How to Solve Facebook App Battery Drain Issue'],"['Android', 'Tech Guides', 'How to', 'Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['November 24, 2016']",2016-11-24 09:14:34+00:00,"['We all love Facebook, don’t we? It certainly has made connecting with people a lot easier. However, if you use Android then you should consider deleting the Facebook application from your device; because there have been numerous cases that showed Android Facebook app drains the battery of your smartphone by upto 20% (don’t worry, we will talk about the solution later).  The Case  After receiving a lot of complaints about the Facebook app from android users, about a year ago Facebook’s central item officer,  Chris Cox , asked his staff to ditch iPhones and use Android until the problem was solved.\xa0 However, the problem seems to be persistent despite many updates.  Android blogger  Russell Holly , from  Android Central , detailed the issues with the app on January. Which, in turn, lead bloggers from  Tech World Zone  and  The Guardian  and a Reddit user named  pbrandes_eth  to test and see the problem for themselves.        The blogger from TWZ\xa0 used  Huawei Nexus 6P  for testing and reported that the phone had 20% more battery after dumping the Facebook app. The result was true for every day on average over the period of a week.\xa0 Although, Android’s built-in battery monitoring statistics didn’t show Facebook using an excessive amount of battery, the battery consumption by Android OS and Android Framework decreased after uninstalling the app.  Similarly, users engaged in the  Reddit post by  pbrandes_eth  found that when the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps were deleted from the phone, the phone performed 15% faster.  Pbandes_eth  tested 15 separate apps and documented the findings. This drove other Reddit users to test other devices. They found similar results when testing for app executing performance.  The cases show that Facebook evidently does not spare your phone’s battery and performance. One reason for these issues maybe because there is a lot happening on Facebook and it needs to run continuously.  So, it’s best for your Android device if you ditch the Facebook app and use other methods to use Facebook on your smartphone.  Alternatives to Facebook app:   You can use the light version of the official Facebook app. You can get it here:   2. Use Facebook from your browser( Mozilla, Chrome, Opera).

Apparently, a five-second video does the job. A 5-second .mp4 video that crashes any iPhones or iPads, is going viral since yesterday.  Glitch Video:\xa0https://vk.com/doc106491973_439166823  If you’re an iPhone or iPad user and hasn’t got a .mp4 video link from any of your friends recently then you are lucky to not have a friend pulling pranks on you. A five-second video circling the web has been reported to have crashed iPhones and iPads of many. But if you by any chance happen to be a victim. There is no need to panic. The bug won’t have a long-lasting effect on your device. The victimized device will work as it was working before just after a force reboot.        A forced reboot can be done on your device by simply pressing the home button and lock button together for around 10 seconds. The new iPhone 7/7 Plus users are likely to panic more because, unlike old devices, force reboot is done by pressing volume down and lock button together in these new devices. Then the apple logo will start showing up, that’s the boot screen. After a minute or two, your device is all good to go. But remember, not to play that video again. If you do, you have to repeat the same fix again.   For those wondering what’s in the video that actually makes any iPhones or iPads freeze, when you play the video in Safari, you would see a boy standing by his bed and catching something like a paper that is passed to him. The word “HONEY” is overlayed on the video. At the end of the video, there’s this credential to a Russian Social Networking site, Miaopai. There is literally nothing in that 5 seconds video. What happens is after the video is done playing. You’ll notice your phone slowing down, freezing up and finally crashing in just lesser than 30 seconds. If you are one of those who believes your phone will fix on its own, you’ll be waiting forever staring at your screen playing that video buffering kind of graphics.  The bug is most likely sparked because the video is a corrupt file which starts a memory leak chain when it is opened in Apple’s Safari web browser, reports The Next Web.  The Apple hasn’t said much regarding this issue and will certainly fix it with an update very soon. So, stay away from such video links until your device gets a new update. And for those Android Fanboys who are thinking to search for that video link with the intent of sending it to their friend with iPhone or iPad who always argues saying IOS is greater than Android, just don’t do it. But still, if you do, let them know about the quick fix.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iphone-crash.png']

It runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat, which could be a huge let off for some. It comes with a small 2200mAh battery which can be charged quickly as it supports Quick Charge 1.0.        The Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, on the other hand, packs some impressive looking specifications. It features a crisp 5.5-inch full HD display with 403 as its PPI. If the fact that the device is running on Android 5.0 Lollipop is ignored, it is an excellent buy. Under the hood, it is equipped with a Quad-core MediaTek MT6795 Helio X10 SoC. It runs on 2GB RAM and has an internal storage of 16GB which can be expanded up to 32 GB just like its predecessor- the Redmi 2 Pro.

With  GoPro \xa0you can capture videos or photos in HD while still being engaged in the activity (I know even your smartphone can capture in HD but the downside with  smartphone camera  is that you miss out all the fun; because you are busy clicking the photos.)  And, to Nepali  GoPro  fans who are waiting for an upgraded version, the wait is over. The GoPro Hero5 Black is now available in Nepal at NPR 35,000. You can buy it from  Sastodeal . Why is GoPro Hero5 Black so awesome? Well, here are some of the features of GoPro Hero5 Black that make it so alluring.   Design  The Hero5 Black is 44.5mm tall and 62mm wide, weighing 117g. Although it might look small, you will be surprised by the amount of possible things you can do with it with ease. It has a touchscreen on its back which makes it very convenient to use. The new UI is so straightforward that even a first-timer can pick it up and use it in no time. Plus, the new rounded corners on Hero5 Black feels good in your hand.        Camera  The camera can shoot 4k videos at 30fps,  2.7K at 60fps. 1440p at 80fps and 1080p at 120fps. It can take Wide Dynamic Range 12 megapixel still photos. The new GoPro supports RAW format as well. You also get increased image stability when things are little shaky– it uses electronic image stabilization rather than optical image stabilization.  Voice Control  This is a completely new feature exclusive to Hero5 Black and Hero5 session. You can now say  few commands  to start/stop recording and capturing. The voice control supports 7 languages: English (U.S., Australian, U.K.), German, French, Italian, Spanish (EU, N.A.), Chinese, Japanese.  The disadvantage of this feature is that anyone can command your GoPro. For instance, you asked your GoPro to start recording, but your friend decided to play a joke on you and ask it to stop (friends love pranking).  Waterproof  Unlike previous versions, you don’t need a separate housing to shoot in water. The inbuilt waterproof technology in Hero5 lets you shoot up to 10m inside water. So, just jump in, and start capturing!  Better Audio  The new GoPro Hero5 Black has 3 microphones and the new software picks the best one for you. So, you can talk freely and need not worry about the audio quality.  GoPro+  A new cloud connection feature allows\xa0 GoPro Hero 5 to auto-upload your recordings to your GoPro+ account over Wi-Fi while the camera is charging. You can then also edit and share your captures with GoPro+.   GPS  You can now enable GPS while taking videos in GoPro Hero5 Black. Once the GPS is locked into satellite, it can collect information about your GPS path, speed, altitude, g-force, and elevation gain during your recording session. This feature was not available in previous GoPros’.  In addition to these features, the battery on GoPro Hero5 Black is packed with twice the power compared to its predecessor. Therefore, you can record more! To find out about the battery performance,  click here . Plus, the company claims this is the best product they have made so far.  So, with the new features like voice control (that will make capturing hands-free), better audio and water-resistance, do you think you will get yourself a GoPro Hero5 Black?']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/go-pro-hero-5-camera.jpeg']
['Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4 launched; 5hrs of usage by 5min of charging'],['Qualcomm'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['November 22, 2016']",2016-11-22 08:41:12+00:00,"['‘5 for 5.’ This is Qualcomm’s slogan for their new version of Quick Charge. On Thursday, along with the announcement of the Snapdragon 835, Qualcomm also introduced Quick Charge 4 (4, not 4.0). This new technology will be featured in the premium smartphones equipped with the Snapdragon 835.  First, let’s get into the slogan. Qualcomm went with ‘5 for 5’ because, as the company claims, users will get 5 hours of battery usage after charging their device for meager 5 minutes. Note that all this will depend on the state of your smartphone during charging. This means that smartphone batteries will now charge up 20 percent faster than the present Quick Charge 3.0.  These days, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge technology has become the best fast charging technology in the world. Along with smartphones, battery packs, car adaptors, and wall adaptors also use this feature.        Quick Charge 4 will support USB Type-C and USB Power Delivery. Qualcomm has said that the fast charging is safe and users won’t have to worry about their device getting hot. The company also mentioned that they have decreased its temperature by 5 degree-Celsius. It is also engraved with ‘Battery Saving Technologies 2.0’, a feature that was brought with the Quick Charge 3.0. Just like its name suggests, the feature will help keep your battery safe even when it is charged with a non-compliant cable.  “For typical premium phone users, Quick Charge 4 is engineered to extend smartphone use by five or more hours with only five minutes of charging” , Qualcomm said. “ Using Dual Charge, Qualcomm Technologies parallel charging technology, users can enjoy up to 20 percent faster charging and up to 30 percent higher efficiency compared with Quick Charge 3.0 .”  The next-generation Snapdragon 835, a 10-nanometer chipset manufactured by Samsung for Qualcomm, uses 40% less power and is 27% faster than today’s processors, the company claims. It will probably power all the premium devices of 2017.

['Nano Screen Protector – a high tech gear for your elegant phone'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['November 21, 2016']",2016-11-21 09:29:52+00:00,"['If you are reading this you must really love your phone. Who doesn’t right? Phones are one of the dearest things you have. It is with you 24/7. You share every moment of your life with it. Admit it! It feels like one of your body parts is missing when your phone is not with you. So, why not get the best thing to protect your darling?  We are going to talk about why you should go right away to the market and get your phone a Nano Screen Protector. Some of you might say that you already have a tempered glass installed and it is working just fine. Well, to be honest, I am no-one to tell you what’s best for your phone. But as a tech geek, I think, the new Nano Screen Protector is the best thing out there for your phone’s screen and here’s why!  It’s very thin  You just bought your phone for its incredibly slick design with your hard earned buck. It looks great until you decide to add tempered glass to it. We all know that a thick glass layer on the top of your lovely phone just doesn’t look appealing– but you gotta protect your phone’s screen.         Well, with Nano Screen Protector, your phone will still look beautiful and still be safe from scratches, sudden drops, and hot environment. Because Nano Screen Protector is just 0.35mm thick– \xa00.13mm PET surface and 0.22 mm TPU bottom layer.  It’s super durable  The\xa0Nano Screen Protector has 2 layers and is rated 6H for hardness which is three times the normal tempered-glass you might have right now on your phone. The Company says that its lifetime is over 6 months, which by the way is beyond the lifetime of a normal screen protector. It also has superior impact resistance. It will not crack nor will it have bubbles.   Plus, the nano-polymer technology on the Nano Screen Protector will reduce the risk of phone explosion by 50% (if you still have Galaxy Note 7, hurry!).  It’s amazingly clear  One downside of normal tempered glass is that your phone no longer has that precise clarity. However, the Nano Screen Protector increases the color reproduction by 30% so, your phone will feel as clear as it does without an extra layer of glass over it. It also has Ultra-High Resolution reduction technology that is exclusive to Nano Screen Protector.   Additionally, the oleophobic coating on this nano screen protector helps reduce the attachment and appearance of fingerprints and dust on your phone’s screen so the screen will always look as good as new.  It’s flexible  The new nanotechnology used in this screen protector makes it very flexible. You can actually bend it 360 degrees without getting it damaged (normal screen protection can bend up to 30 degrees until it breaks). This great flexibility helps the screen protector sit perfectly on your phone’s screen.   The only disadvantage of Nano Screen Protector is that it is available\xa0for limited smartphone models only. We have seen mobile companies like ZTE, Colors, Infocus, Obi Worldphone, and even Xiaomi suffering from lack of proper screen guards in Nepal. But, with the manufacturing company of Nano screen protector residing in Nepal, the mobile brands can now order their respective models nano screen guard, and we could soon see tempered glass being replaced by the Nano protector.

"['Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime Review: A complete package in Rs. 22,900']","['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['November 21, 2016']",2016-11-21 05:25:44+00:00,"['2016 has to be the year of the ‘budget phones’ in Nepal. It saw the release of some mid-range proper ‘bang-for-buck’ devices. And even though the year is about to end, smartphone manufacturers and distributors show no sign of stopping. Nepal’s bestselling smartphone company – Samsung is doing just the same.  Samsung recently released a new mid-range device – the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime. A successor to the Samsung Galaxy J5 2016, the device follows Samsung’s trend of releasing new and improved version of its previously released devices. Priced at Rs. 22,990, Can the J5 Prime stand out against the competition? Lets find out on our review.  DESIGN  The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime’s back design is different than any of Samsung’s previous phones as it features a camera and a LED flash at the back with its speaker on the right side. The device sports a glossy metal back with plastic top and bottom for antenna bands. It is thin, and looks and feels premium.At the front, the Galaxy J5 Prime features a typical Samsung smartphone’s design. There is an earpiece at the top along with a front facing camera, and a proximity and accelerometer sensor on its side. On the bottom chin rests a home button, a recent app switcher and a back button. The recent app switcher and the back button aren’t backlit. I had a hard time using these buttons in the dark. It would have been better if Samsung had at least made the buttons backlit.         On the left side, there’s a power button and a speaker grill. Yes, the speaker grill is actually on the side, right above the power button. Volume rockers, SIM slot and a microSD card slot sit on the left side of the device. The bottom of the device features a USB Type-B port, a headphone jack and a primary mic. It lacks a secondary mic for active noise cancellation.        1  of 4                                                          It weighs at 143g and while the metal back and the design of the Galaxy J5 Prime is really good, the device is quite slippery. So, I would suggest you get a case right away.  DISPLAY  The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime flaunts a sleek 5-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels with 294 for the pixels per inch (PPI). Even though the device lacks an AMOLED panel and a 1080p screen, the screen is bright and colorful. It also lacks an ambient sensor but there’s an outdoor mode for watching the display under bright light. The outdoor feature does its work nicely as I had no problem using the device under direct sunlight. Viewing angle is quite decent as well.   Even with the device sporting a 720p screen, the display can go up against some of the 1080p displays. Not that I’m complaining or anything, but Samsung should have gone with an AMOLED display. The display would be more vibrant and the color reproduction would have been better. It is a bummer that the  Samsung Galaxy J1 2016 , a device worth 11,300, features a Super AMOLED display whereas a device worth 22,990 has gone with an IPS LCD display.   SOFTWARE  On the software side, the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime ships with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box. The device comes with Touch Wiz UI on top. Previously, Samsung was criticized for its laggy and clogged interface. But the UI has come a long way as the company toned down TouchWiz and ditched lots of its bloatware. The device comes with a few pre-loaded Samsung apps which can be disabled. It also has preinstalled Microsoft Office apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Skype among others. The Galaxy J5 Prime does feature SBike mode, and Samsung’s S Power planning and S Secure.        1  of 4                                                          Even though I like a stock Android experience, I had no problem using the UI of the device. But it would have been better if Samsung made it simpler and toned down the interface of the applications. Other than this, the software front of the device is snappy and lag-free.  PERFORMANCE  Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime is powered by an Exynos 7570 Quad-core 1.43 GHz Cortex-A53 64-bit processor that is aided by a Mali-T720 GPU and 2GB RAM. The device didn’t lag under normal usage, and after heavy usage, there were minor stutters while using different apps. I should mention that sometimes while gaming, the screen just freezes.\xa0So, if you’re not heavy into gaming, the Exynos 7570 Quad-core processor and the 2GB RAM will handle your everyday task quite nicely.   HARDWARE  On the hardware front, the device features 16GB of onboard storage. While 16GB of storage option might be sufficient to some, it wasn’t enough for me at all. Fortunately, there is a microSD card slot that helps to expand the storage up to 256GB. Its speaker is a setback because it is not loud at all and gets covered when using the device in landscape mode. I previously thought ‘speaker at the back’ was the worst placement for a speaker grill, but the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime made me change my mind. The device has a USB Type-B port for connectivity and charging purpose. It also supports USB on-the-go.   CAMERA  The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear facing camera with f/1.9 aperture. Under bright light, the camera does its job well and takes good pictures. The macro shots and wide-angle shots are good. However, during macro shots, the camera had a hard time focusing on any object. Like all devices of its price range, the Galaxy J5 Prime underperforms under low light as the pictures get noisy and grainy.      Rear camera samples   1  of 3                                                The front facing camera of the device is of 5-megapixel with f/2.2 aperture. It takes some good social media ready pictures in a well-lit environment. Like the primary camera, it too suffers in dark. But in the dark, there is an option that makes the screen glow brightly like the ones seen on iPhones.   The camera app comes with features like Panorama, HDR and beauty face among others. There is a pro-mode which lets you toggle the ISO, White Balance and Exposure. It also lets you choose effects like Sepia, Greyscale, etc.  FINGERPRINT  The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime’s home button at the front serves as a fingerprint sensor. It is fast and easy to set up, with an option of adding multiple fingerprints. At first, the sensor did not function properly, judging every touch as ‘No match’. But as time passed, it started to adapt to my fingerprints and now I can unlock the device without any hiccups.  CONNECTIVITY  The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime has dual SIM slots for two GSM Nano-SIM cards. The device supports 4G connectivity. Other connectivity options include WiFi b/g/n, GPS, Bluetooth v4.2, hotspot and FM Radio. The absence of NFC might discourage some buyers though.  BATTERY  The Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime has a non-removable 2400mAh battery under the hood. Under heavy usage, which included navigating through the internet, watching videos and movies, and playing games constantly with lots of apps running in the background, the device got me a screen-on-time of 5 hours. Under moderate usage, the Galaxy J5 Prime lasted for a day and half. So, if you’re a heavy user, the device will last long without having to worry about charging it again and again. The only bummer is the absence of a removable back as there is no Quick charge.   CONCLUSION  Even with the increasing number of new smartphone manufacturers and distributors setting their roots in Nepal, Samsung is still the bestselling device here. It sells some bang-for-buck devices, and that trend looks set to continue with the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime. Even though its hardware specs are similar to some of the devices in the lower price range, the display, build quality, performance and camera are second to none.   Except for its rare stutters and poor functioning camera under low light, overall the device is quite snappy. And just as its name suggests, it is a prime smartphone in its price range. You won’t regret your decision if you spend your hard-earned cash to buy the Samsung J5 Prime.  [socialpoll id=”2402031″] If you’re not impressed by the specs and performance of the Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime, here are some other options for you:  Huawei GR5  Priced at Rs. 24,500, the Huawei GR5 offers a better rear camera, and a bigger battery than that of the Galaxy J5 Prime. However, quality of the 720p display is almost equal to the quality of the 1080p display Huawei GR5 possesses.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro  Priced at Rs. 27,999, the Redmi Note 3 Pro offers excellent performance with Snapdragon 650 SoC under the hood. It also offers a good 16MP rear facing camera and a huge 4100mAh battery.  Meizu M3 Note    Featuring an excellent design and a great battery life, the Meizu M3 Note is another good choice. However, the device’s camera is not good and the performance is average. It is priced at Rs. 24,995.  Gionee S6s  One of Gionee’s best smartphones, the Gionee S6s combines attractive looks, excellent build quality, superb front camera, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box to go with an attractive price tag of Rs. 25,999. Having said that, you will compromise in 3 areas: performance, rear camera, and fast charging.

And today, at a press event in New York, Qualcomm and Samsung announced that the Korean company will be manufacturing Qualcomm’s newest chipset that will power most of the premium smartphones of 2017.  If stats are considered, the processor is an absolute beast. Qualcomm and Samsung claim that the chip is 27% faster, houses 30% less space and uses 40% less power than today’s premium chips – Snapdragon 820 and 821. The Snapdragon 820 and 821 processors use a 14nm manufacturing technique.         The chipset will pack millions more transistors into a smaller sized processor. And the 10nm processor is really small, like really, really small (10 nanometers is 6,000 times shorter than the diameter of a strand of human hair). This will surely help smartphone manufacturers in making a thinner device, or use the ample extra space to house a larger battery.  Speaking at the event, Keith Kressin, Senior Vice President of Product Management for Qualcomm said, “ Using the new 10nm process node is expected to allow our premium tier Snapdragon 835 processor to deliver power efficiency and increase performance while also allowing us to add a number of new capabilities that can improve the user experience of tomorrow’s devices .”  It was previously thought that Qualcomm was manufacturing Snapdragon 830 but with the launch of Snapdragon 835 we don’t know where the company stands with the 830.  We can expect the Snapdragon 835 to release along with a new premium smartphone (probably Samsung Galaxy S8) at the Mobile World Congress next February.  In a statement, the executive vice president and head of Samsung’s foundry business, Jong Shik Yoon, said, “ This collaboration is an important milestone for our foundry business as it signifies confidence in Samsung’s leading chip process technology .”   [where-to-buy buy_id=21581]']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/snapdragon.jpg']

You will be surprised how easy it is to top-up your balance. Plus, Nepzy is giving you Rs. 10 cashback on recharge of Rs. 100 or more as a promotional offer.        2.

['DJI releases Phantom 4 pro along with Inspire 2'],['Drone'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['November 17, 2016']",2016-11-17 09:56:14+00:00,"['DJI, the highly recognized Chinese company in drone industry, has released a pro version drone of its Phantom 4 edition on November 15th. The company also released Inspire 2 which is its fourth new release in last two months. Looking at its pace of releasing products, DJI seems to be in competition with no other drone makers but itself.  DJI Phantom 4 pro isn’t a new revolutionary drone but an update to its predecessor Phantom 4 which came out just eight months ago. With that being said, Phantom 4 pro has a lot more to offer than any previously released Phantom units. As compared to Phantom 4, the Pro houses a better camera, more advanced (360 degrees) \xa0obstacle avoidance, greater battery life, and additional intelligent flight modes. With its release, Phantom line has become stronger as compared to the new Mavic pro which is still the smallest, most portable and cheapest among the newly released drones from DJI.  DJI Phantom 4 Pro  Digging out the specs, DJI Phantom 4 pro has a better camera with the mechanical shutter that will supposedly avoid Jell-O-like shake in the footage caused from rolling shutter effect while filming quick pans or chasing fast moving subjects. It has a 1-inch CMOS sensor that shoots 20 megapixels still and can capture upto 11.6 stops of dynamic range. In burst mode, pictures can be taken at speed of 14 photos per second. The camera is capable of taking 4k videos at 60 frames per second. The drone supports micro SD cards upto 128GB that has to be of class 10 or UHS – 1 rating.        Key features of DJI Phantom 4Pro  Unlike the DJI Phantom 4 and Mavic Pro which had obstacle avoidance system that worked only while moving forward, the Phantom 4 pro has sensors on all four sides, meaning the drone can sense and avoid obstacles while moving in any direction. 31mph is the new top speed while in obstacle avoidance mode which is a remarkable bump as compared to old 22mph. Keep that in mind, 31 mph is top speed in p-mode \xa0and the drone can hit a max speed of 45 mph in sports mode.  With the new battery capacity of 5870 mAh, the battery life has got an upgrade too and the aircraft will give an approximate flight time of 30 Minutes. That is 20% of increment as compared to 25 minutes flight time of Phantom 4.  Phantom 4 Pro’s Controller with inbuilt screen  The remote controller has the control range of 4.3*miles transmitting HD output and intelligently switches between 2.4Ghz or 5.8 Ghz choosing the one with the lowest interference at the time of starting the drone . The controller can have an inbuilt display of 5.5-inch screen with a resolution of 1920*1080. The inbuilt display device has 4GB RAM and 16 GB ROM.The Phantom 4Pro costs $1,499 with the regular controller without the display. If you want to save your phone’s or tablet’s juice and opt for a controller with a built-in screen that will get you to pay for an additional pay of $300 making the total price of the unit to be $1,799.

['Gionee S9 with Dual Rear Camera Launched'],['Gionee'],['By Santo Pok -  '],"['November 16, 2016']",2016-11-16 09:31:21+00:00,"['Gionee has launched the  S9 smartphone , the first Gionee phone to sport dual rear cameras, at an event in China on November 15th. It is a successor to Gionee S8 that was launched at Mobile World Congress in February and was later released in June this year. The Phone follows a typical guideline for phones in 2016 and considering the specs the phone sounds more like a “flagship wannabe” and less like a flagship itself. The phone that is priced at CNY 2499 (Rs. 39,482 approx) and comes in color options of Black, Gold and Rose Gold.  The phone follows the design guideline of its predecessor which can be easily said to look like the Apple-inspired design which is common for many Chinese phone manufacturers these days. The phone comes in a 7.4 mm thick metal unibody that has a home button with an integrated fingerprint sensor and two capacitive buttons for back and recent apps are on its sides. It has 5.5″ LCD display with 2.5D curved glass and offers the resolution 1080*1920 giving 401 PPI and 70.8% screen to body ratio. Under the hood, the phone is powered by 2GHz octa-core MediaTek (MT6755) Helio P10 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM. It comes with native storage of 64 GB and can be expanded upto 128GB via SD card in its hybrid dual Sim tray. It runs on Amigo OS 3.5 built on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow.         It’s the imaging department where the phone has a strong chance of coming in limelight. This time around, Gionee has decided to go on board with dual rear camera bandwagon. Since many phone manufacturers have been putting two lenses at the back instead of one as dual cameras can aid upto different features like wide angles, faster focus, optical zooming and better Bokeh effect. In this setup of vertically placed 13MP and 5MP that Gionee has come up with, is said to have added the advantage of focusing on production of the depth of field effect. The primary rear camera of 13 megapixel uses the camera sensor from Sony whereas the secondary rear camera of 5 megapixel uses that of Samsung. The selfies will undoubtedly come good with a 13-megapixel camera bundled with a Selfie flash.  The S9 weighing 168gm is found 20 gm heavier than its predecessor but the added weight doesn’t seem to upgrade the battery capacity which might be a let down to power users out there. Hence, the battery capacity of the phone is 3000mAh which is just same as the Gionee S8.  The phone will go on sale in China from November 25th and for the global release of the phone, we have not heard any officials words yet. Hopefully, in near future Gionee will launch this new phone in the market of Nepal as well. We can’t wait to see how well this first dual lens setup on any Gionee phone is gonna perform. Are you excited about what Gionee is offering in its new product? Do you think it’s worth an upgrade for those owning a Gionee S8 already? Please feel free to write down your opinion towards this newly released Gionee S9 in the comment section down below.

Day by day our necessities are changing due to the advancement of technology. The majority of these developments are directly affecting our daily activities. One of them is the evolution of mobile networks.  In today’s world, no one is untouched from the spell of fascinating virtual life. The Internet is an inseparable part of our daily life. In this scenario, the telecom companies are always trying to cope with the requirement of its customers. In past mobiles were the mere means of telephony services and SMS services. But presently the huge leaps of technology have ensured the unlimited possibilities. Sending audios, videos, images; surfing the internet; downloading and uploading seems quite normal. Recently some rumors are spreading \xa0like wildfire about the new coming technology ‘4G’ to hit Nepali market soon.  What is 4G? And why do we even need it?  4G stands for the 4 th  generation in telecommunication technology. It is the successor of 3G. 4G is better and faster than 3G, a whole lot better. It has an incredible peak speed of 100Mbps (Megabits per second) theoretically only. Practically, a lot less but greater than twice that of 3G. 4G uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) technology. Basically, it’s a method of splitting and tight packing of data for parallel transmission using MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) concepts. Basically, in laymen’s term 4G is a fast internet service provided by mobile networks with the high speed of 100Mbps.        Nepal Telecommunication Corporation(NTC) is the winner in the race for approval of the license. According to NTC, the prevailing WiMAX Service is up to the standard of 4G. Ncell has also applied for the license. Minister for Information and Communication, Mr. Sherdhan Rai said that the existing 3G service will be expanded nationwide and 4G service will be started at Kathmandu Metropolitan City along with some major sub-metropolitan cities.  The major drawback for 4G is its lack of traditional circuitry for telephony service as like in 3G. But we can use VoLTE (Voice over LTE) function provided by apps like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber, Facebook, etc. for telephony service. If someone wants to make a voice call from 4G network without VoLTE feature, the network is automatically dropped to 3G or 2G network.  The necessity of 4G is felt at various places. A better internet ensures the uninterrupted call (voice or video) to their loved ones. A faster one takes less time to download or upload a great movie, songs, images,etc. Live streaming is possible without waiting for buffering. And best of all speed ensures the development of a nation is on right track.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4G-in-Nepal.png']

Micromax hasn’t mentioned whether the Bolt Mega Q397 will receive Android 7.0 Nougat or not. Memory wise, the device features 16GB of internal storage which can be expanded up to 32GB via a microSD card.        Smartphone users are into selfies, and Micromax looks to cash in on that as the front facing camera of the Bolt Mega Q397 features a LED flash. Although a 2-megapixel secondary camera doesn’t sound good on papers, the front facing flash will surely help to take some good selfies. On the back, there is an 8-megapixel rear facing camera.  The Micromax Bolt Mega Q397 packs a little bit of weight weighing 174.7 grams. Other features of the device include dual SIM (Normal + Micro) with 3G connectivity, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and, of course, a headphone jack, something not even some of the big hitting smartphones feature these days. A 2650mAh battery runs the device which will last long because of its 720p display.

Despite being a year old phone what it has to offer still satisfies the need of 2016. The phone sports unibody metal construct, and comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display, so it’s going to be a great display for the multimedia consumption and overall everything’s gonna look sharp and crisp.         Apart from that, the Axon Elite also comes with a dual camera setup, where the primary camera is 13MP and the 2MP secondary camera helps to bring out bokeh effect just like in the Huawei P9. The phone is still running on Android 5.0.2 Lollipop and hasn’t been upgraded till now. Apart from this, the UI is pretty much stock like with few visual upgrades from ZTE.  Being a flagship phone from last year, ZTE Axon is powered by the Snapdragon 810 chipset combined with 3GB of RAM. This phone should fly off while playing games and doing heavy multitasking. The Snapdragon 810 SoC has had heating problems, but ZTE has integrated a new heat dissipation system around the chassis that allows for successful cooling. Talking about storage, the phone comes with 32GB Internal storage which is expandable via microSD card up to 128GB. The phone also comes with the Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology along with a 3,000mAh battery.

The premium features that sets this device apart from the regular ZTE Axon mini and its bigger sibling ZTE Axon is the pressure sensitive display like in the iPhone 6s and 7’s as well as eye recognition and voice recognition.  Axon Mini premium closely resembles the ZTE Axon , but sports a smaller 5.2-inch display which is Super AMOLED. The only function of pressure sensitive display is for the pressure sensitive screen lock, where you have to apply a different amount of pressure to unlock the device. The phone also comes with a fingerprint sensor on the back and just above it, rests a 13MP camera and up front it sports an 8MP Camera.  In terms of performance, the phone packs a mildly powerful Snapdragon 616 coupled with 3GB of RAM. The phone should be a decent performer and could withstand mild gaming and multitasking.

"['Meizu M3 Note Review: Light on Price, but Strong on Design']","['Meizu', 'Reviews']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['November 7, 2016']",2016-11-07 11:11:52+00:00,"['As brands are introducing more and more products in the  mid-range segment  of a smartphone, the segment has been receiving a lot of attention with an extended number of products available to the customers. The extension grew further with Meizu launching its latest midrange phone  M3 Note in Nepal  for Rs. 24,995. Does this phone stand out among the crowded mid-range segment? Let’s find out in this review.  DESIGN  The Meizu m3 note has a very eye appealing yet sturdy design. The phone looks premium with is metal finish at the back and is very attractive from the front with its Dinorex glass protection and a single home button which is also its fingerprint scanner. The phone just weighs 163g which is light for a 5.5” metal phone. The overall design feels brilliant and does shine in its segment.         The Meizu M3 Note comes with an all metal back with a 13MP camera while the top and bottom remain plastic for the antenna bands. The front carries a 5.5″ screen which is protected by the Dinorex T2X-1 scratch/shock resistant glass protecting the 5MP camera, one home button which also is a fingerprint scanner and some sensors. The sensors on m3 are Compass Magnetometer, Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, Ambient light sensor, and Gyroscope.   The phone comes with a single home button and there are no back and apps buttons which we find in almost all android phones. The button can be used as the home button by physically pressing it and as a back button through gentle taps. And to top that the button is also the fingerprint scanner of the phone which is surprisingly very fast for this segment. This interesting adaptation did impress me.      Meizu M3 Note Design & Looks   1  of 4                                                          DISPLAY  The m3 note comes with 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with 1080p resolution that nets a total pixel density of 403ppi screen. The screen comes with nice viewing angles and good brightness level in the indoor environment. But visibility suffers greatly in outdoor sunlight.   The screen comes with The Dinorex T2X-1 scratch/shock resistant glass protecting the 5.5″ display which looks nice and enhances the front view of the phone. The protection did amaze me in the paper but on real life scenario, it did not dazzle me. Upon simple daily handling and placing the phone in a pocket with keys and coins, micro scratches were found on further detailed examination. But the screen and display package does outstand other phones is this segment.   SOFTWARE  The phone comes with Flyme 5 OS which is based on Android Lollipop 5.1. The interface heavily reminds me of iOS. There is no app drawer and all the apps are listed on the home screen. The phone comes with very limited apps unlike other Chinese OS which are loaded huge bloatware.   One thing regarding the Flame that took my attention is that it did not come with Google Play Store. But it did come with Hot Apps that enlisted a list of all-time favorite apps like Facebook, W\xadhatsApp, etc. Upon powering on the phone for the first time there was a notification of Hot Apps by default which insisted on downloading Google Play store which was a one-touch affair. The Flyme OS may not be appreciated by many users, but after getting used to it delivered a very smooth experience to me.  PERFORMANCE  The m3 note is using a\xa0Mediatek Helio P10, which embeds \xa0a quad-core 1.8GHz Cortex-A53 and a quad-core 1.0GHz Cortex-A53 chip with a Mali-T860MP2 GPU. We tested the 32GB of storage with 3 GB RAM and performance is still decent for what one pays for the price. You would not find lag unless you use a power heavy game or app. A \xa0Mediatek processor at this price range did not please me as you will get better phones with\xa0more capable SoCs at this price range.      Benchmark Score    1  of 3               Quadrant Score          Antutu Score         Geekbench Score                     CAMERA  The phone comes with a 13 MP back camera and 5 MP front shooter. The back camera comes with a dual tone camera and phase detection autofocus, but no optical image stabilization. The camera interface has quick access to flash, timer, front camera, settings and different modes like Beauty mode, Manual mode, and even a GIF mode. One can also shoot on HDR by selecting the feature through settings.   On actual usage, the camera falls short at many instances to what it speaks in the paper. The images lacked detail and dynamic range. Certain noise crept in the shots despite different lighting condition. The phone is fine for taking pictures once in a while but would disappoint if you are someone with a high camera performance as a priority.\xa0The 5MP front camera is good for taking selfies and video calling.      Back Camera Samples    1  of 2                                      CONNECTIVITY  Connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared, USB OTG, and 4G LTE support. Sensors on the phone include Compass, Proximity sensor, Accelerometer, Ambient light sensor, and Gyroscope.   The Meizu m3 Note has a dual hybrid SIM slot, i.e. SIM+SIM/micro SD card. It supports a micro SIM and a Nano SIM with 4G. I found the call quality to be excellent.  BATTERY  The phone is powered by a 4100mAh non-removable battery.\xa0 Fast charging is not available on this device but the battery performance of the phone is remarkable. The phone easily lasts more than a day with ease. With 4100mah monster power and excellent customization, m3 note excels in its battery performance.  CONCLUSION  Meizu m3 Note outshines at some of its features and doesn’t in some. The phone overwhelms with its shimmering design and excellent battery performance, but let’s down with its camera and average performance. Overall the phone is still a good handset but in the current market flooded with similar devices, it is not difficult to find a device that delivers better value at the price.   Let’s also look around to see what other phones can one get for the money Meizu is asking for the M3 Note. Here are some of the notable alternatives to the device  Huawei GR5   Priced at Rs. 24,500, the Huawei GR5 offers a better rear camera, and feature rich fingerprint scanner, however, it’s 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM is no match for the 3GB/32GB storage of the Meizu M3 Note.   Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro  Priced at Rs. 27,999, the Redmi Note 3 Pro offers excellent performance with Snapdragon 650 Soc onboard. It also offers a good 16MP rear camera and a huge 4100mAh battery.   Gionee S6s  Priced at Rs.\xa025,999, the Gionee S6s offers 8MP front snapper which is twice as good as the 5MP front snapper found on the M3 Note.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Meizu-M3-Note-featured-image-scaled.jpg']

Samsung released a flip phone that is estimated to run you $2953 when it hits the market. A staggering Rs. 315,363 worth of flip phone! But the device, code-named Veyron, is not any ordinary flip phone. It packs specs a flagship phone of today would pack.  Samsung released the  Samsung Galaxy Folder 2  in August. It was a great flip phone that was equipped with features a low-end smartphone of the present time is equipped with. It was packed with features like Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 Chipset with 1.4GHz quad-core processor, 2GB RAM, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow among others. However, it looks like the company isn’t stopping there.         Yes, the specs are top-notch, but it doesn’t justify the pricing at all. The flip phone features dual displays, one on the outside and another on the inside.\xa0The display comes with an ‘Always On’ feature like Samsung’s flagship nowadays have. The display stands 4.2-inch tall. It has full HD (1080 x 1920 pixels) resolution.  And it’s not just that. The Samsung W2017 is powered by a Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor that is aided by a whopping 4GB RAM. Not so ordinary now, is it? And it doesn’t stop there. The device features 64GB of onboard storage.   Talking about the camera, the Samsung W2017 houses a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a f/1.9 aperture with 4K video recording and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies. On the software department, the device runs on Android 6.0.1 and even features a fingerprint sensor. Other features include NFC and dual SIM with LTE. How cool is that?  The Samsung W2017 is powered by a 2,300 mAh battery that can be charged via wireless charging. The only drawback is that this device will probably be exclusive to China. However, it could be made available in other countries if there is a huge demand for the device. I should also mention that there is no Headphone jack!

Generation Nxt, the official distributor of Apple products here in Nepal, has already started the Pre-Order from its different resell partners (Oliz Store, Evo Store, Sonu Mobiles, Future World) for all the five variants of the new Macbook Pro.  First off, the new  MacBook Pro 2016 \xa0doesn’t offer any significant changes in terms of the design but unfortunately the glowing Apple logo is no more! But it does come with some functional changes compared to the previous generation like it has  130% better graphics, 67% brighter display , faster performance, better audio quality, most functional trackpad and most importantly now an OLED bar and Touch ID. But it lacks the most basic things like a micro USB port and an SD card reader, instead, you get 4 ThunderBolt Ports with high data transfer rate. So you might need to buy few extra micro USB to USB c adapters.  The most hyped thing about the new MacBook is obviously the OLED bar which now replaces the function keys. The functionality of this bar changes based on the application you’re using giving you quick shortcuts and other information. Apple has also integrated the 2 nd  gen of Butterfly keyboard for better travel while typing.         So there are three variants of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the base version comes without the OLED touch bar, 2.0Ghz processor, 256GB SSD, the second variant comes with an OLED bar and Touch ID, 2.9GHz processor, and 256GB SSD, and the highest variant comes with the OLED bar and Touch ID, 2.9GHz Processor and 512GB SSD. All the three variants come with Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. Apple has discontinued the MacBook Air lineup cause these 13inch laptops are just that light and portable.  Coming to the bigger 15-inch MacBook pros, there are two versions and both versions come with the OLED bar and Touch ID. The base version comes with 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 256GB PCIe-based SSD and Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB memory, and the maxed out version comes with 2.7GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 512GB PCIe-based SSD, and Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB memory.

Like all new smartphones these days, the leaks of the Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro have been pouring online. And according to those leaks, the Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro will feature big displays and good battery life, just like their predecessors. However, if some rumors are to be believed, the Huawei Mate 9 Pro will come at a staggering price of $1,300.  This article is based on the rumors that have circulated over the internet. These specifications could change once the devices are released.         Display, Design, and Hardware  Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro will feature designs we have already seen in the past.  The Huawei Mate 9 stands 5.9-inch tall and will reportedly sport a display of resolution 1080 x 1920 pixels with 373 for the PPI. The classic model, code-named Manhattan, looks much like the  Huawei Mate 8 . It will have a metal body and slightly rounded off edges.  The Huawei Mate 9 Pro, code-named Long Island, will feature a Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixels) display. It looks so much like the  Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge  and the  Galaxy Note 7  because of the curved screen and the physical home button mounted below the display. This physical button will also serve as a fingerprint sensor and will be coupled with a second fingerprint sensor at the back.  Both Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro will feature HiSilicon’s new and powerful Octa-core  Hisilicon Kirin 960 processor  clocked at 2.6GHz.  Software and Memory  The Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro will run on  Android 7.0 Nougat  out of the box with Emotion UI 5.0 on top. These two devices will be the first of Huawei’s devices to run the newest version of Android OS.  Both devices will be available in three storage option –  64GB, 128GB, and 256GB . The 64GB and 128GB variant will feature  4GB RAM  while the 256GB variant will have  6GB RAM . According to some rumors, these devices will even house a microSD card slot giving users an  additional 256GB of storage .  Camera and Battery  Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro will reportedly feature dual cameras.  Reports have stated that both the Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro will boast  Leica-branded dual rear facing 20-megapixel and 12-megapixel camera  with  f/2.0 aperture . The dual primary cameras on their last flagship,the P9, were stunning. So, we can expect the the Mate9 and Mate 9 Pro’s cameras to be amazing as well. These dual cameras will be equipped with  Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)  and  4x optical zoom . The rear facing camera will be accompanied by an  8-megapixel front facing camera .  There have been some debates about the battery size in the devices. Some rumors suggest that the Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro will feature a huge  4000mAh battery  whereas some suggest the device will house a  3000mAh battery . But 4000mAh seems more believable as the Huawei Mate 8 had the same battery capacity and the company certainly wants the battery to last long in the Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro.  Release Date and Price  Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro release date: November 3, 2016.  Huawei has already sent out invitations to a press event on  3rd November  in Munich. The company hasn’t mentioned anything about the Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro though, saying it will launch a ‘new flagship device’ in the event.

The photo will then be uploaded in the Huawei Mobiles Facebook page and the the participants with the highest number of likes will win the contest.  The Huawei P9, priced at Rs. 59,999 is one of the best camera phones you can buy right now. It sports a dual camera sensor; both the camera with a 12MP sensor. The first camera has an RGB sensor and the second camera has a monochrome sensor which only takes black and white photos. Both the camera simultaneously takes the photo and combines them to produce a greater quality image.         The monochrome sensor allows the camera to capture just the light, not the color, so it has higher details and sharpness, while the RGB sensor takes the photo in color which filters the lights coming to its sensor resulting in loss of details so when both the photos are combined a better quality image is obtained. This is noticeable particularly in bright highlights and dark shadows where details are easily missed by single/small sensors.  Also, the dual camera sensor on the Huawei P9 allows us to select multiple focus points which give a greater depth of field with closer shots. But the P9 doesn’t come\xa0with Optical Image Stabilization. All and all the camera on P9 is supposed to be crazy fast and take high-quality photos and seems like the dual camera will be a thing in all smartphones in coming years but as of now only the P9 and LG G5 have a dual camera.

['Samsung J1 2016 Review: Does this galaxy explode?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['October 28, 2016']",2016-10-27 22:49:46+00:00,"['The Chinese smartphones have taken over Samsung’s budget lineup over the past couple of years as the company is struggling to offer better-specced budget phones when compared to its Chinese counterpart. The recently launched Galaxy J1 2016, the successor to last year’s Galaxy J1, offers meaningful updates like bigger sharp AMOLED display, quad-core processor, and 1GB of RAM — all for an asking price of Rs. 11,300. Can the J1 2016 stand out against the competition in providing the best experience in the budget category? Let’s find out.  Design:  The Galaxy J1 2016 is reminiscent of the previous Samsung phones as it’s entirely made up of plastic with a\xa0faux metal frame. The back is removable giving users access to the replaceable battery, microSD card slot, and 2 SIM card slot. Despite featuring a plastic back, the phone is not cheap by any means and feels sturdier in the hands.         The size of the device is compact and ergonomic as it sports a 4.5-inch display and thus the one hand operation is an advantage. It weighs at 131gms and measures 8.9mm in thickness. The power button is on the right while the volume rocker is on the left. The front houses a 2MP front camera,\xa0earpiece and proximity sensor. The phone lacks an ambient light sensor like with all the Samsung J-series of smartphones, hence the brightness level have to be adjusted manually.   The back houses a 5MP camera with LED flash, loud speaker, and\xa0Samsung’s traditional Home button, which feels marvelous and responsive and hence gives nice feedback.\xa0At the bottom, there is a microUSB port and the primary mic (no secondary noise cancellation mic). The 3.5mm headphone jack sits on the top.\xa0Overall, the Galaxy J1 2016 punches well above its weight when it comes to design and build.   Display:  The Galaxy J1 2016 has a 4.5-inch display with a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels netting a total pixel density of 207ppi. You could easily get smartphones under Rs. 12,000 with HD IPS LCD display, but the J1 2016 \xa0has a Super AMOLED display that offers excellent contrast and oversaturated colors.   The brightness is also stellar for the price tag with great outdoor visibility.\xa0Although it lacks display protection, but using the phone for 2 weeks I didn’t have any scratch without any tempered glass.  Software UI:  The Samsung Galaxy J1 2016 still boots on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with Touch Wiz UI which means you will miss out on few Marshmallow features like Doze and Now On Tap. Over the years, the UI on Samsung phones has become bloat free and optimized, and the J1 2016 is no exception.   It comes with some preinstalled apps like Google’s mandatory apps, Operamax data saving app, and Ultra power saving mode. The Sbike Mode that was embedded in the J3 2016 and J5/J7 series is not included on this model.  Performance:  The Samsung Galaxy J1 2016 is powered by a\xa0Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7 processor (Spreadtrum SC9830) and 1GB of RAM. The phone doesn’t lag at all while performing basic tasks like navigating through UI, browsing, and using Facebook. However, like with all the budget phones, the J1 suffers while multitasking and playing games — all because of iffy underperforming Cortex A7 32bit processor and 1GB of RAM.   It’s a real shame that Samsung didn’t include 2GB of RAM which would have made the phone perform substantially better. There are many phones with 2GB of RAM\xa0for the money Samsung is asking for the Galaxy J1 2016.\xa0The phone comes with just 8GB of ROM and after installing few apps you will soon realize that you will require a microSD card to expand your storage.  Camera:  The 5MP rear camera on the J1 2016 is mediocre, but having said that, the J1 2016 flairs well well compared to the competition. It is far better than what you get at this price range.\xa0During daylight, the photos come\xa0out decent at first impression, but there is nothing to write home about. The color reproduction is inaccurate and the photos lack in details while you zoom in. Dynamic range is poor considering the price tag and it also lacks HDR mode. The low light photography is below average with lots of noise.   The 2MP front camera is below average even for social media uploads. It would be better of pointing the main snapper and hoping for the best shot.  Connectivity:  The Samsung J1 2016 supports 2 SIM, first slot with 4G and the second slot with 3G. Other connectivity options include 2.4GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ with hotspot support, Bluetooth v4.0, an FM radio, and GPS. As expected at this price range, NFC is missing here.  Call quality:  Despite lacking secondary noise cancellation mic, the Samsung Galaxy J1 2016’s call quality was surprisingly good. It’s\xa0clear on both the receiver and transmitter end.\xa0The loudspeaker is also clear and loud for an entry-level device.   Battery:  The Battery is another asset of the Samsung J1 2016. On our test, the phone lasted 2 days on moderate usage with 2 hours of browsing, 1 hour of 3G calling, and 1 hour of youtube. The phone offers 4-5 hours of onscreen time on medium brightness.   The battery on the Galaxy J1 2016 is removable which means you can just remove the back cover and replace it. Since the phone lacks quick charge technology, it won’t be a bad investment if buy an extra battery for your needs.  Conclusion:  There’s a lot of things to like about the Samsung J1 2016, but there are equally a lot of things to dislike. What I liked about the phone is its compact form factor,\xa0Vivid display with good contrast and oversaturated colors, excellent call quality, \xa0and good battery life.  However, 1GB of RAM and the iffy quad-core processor\xa0is disappointing. The front camera is below par too. To be honest, you can get better value from other manufacturers if you are willing to spend 2-3K more, but if you are not, Samsung J1 2016 is a solid choice.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/samsung-galaxy-j1-2016-review-scaled.jpg']

The update will be called the  Microsoft Creators Update   and it has got a lot of features that has got us excited. This update will be focused more on Virtual Reality, 3D objects, and seamless interaction so it might bring something new to the computing table.  Paint 3D:   Paint is one of the most popular Microsoft application which millions of use for simple doodling or messing around. We’ve been hearing the rumors about the revamped looks of Paint but we didn’t\xa0know it’ll support painting and creating 3D objects. In an on-stage demo, a sand castle was scanned with the HP X3 smartphone using Windows Capture 3D app and then the image was ported to Paint for editing and was shared with few people to view on VR. This is incredible as anyone can now work with 3D and VR per se. Paint has become more powerful and besides being able to draw 3D, Microsoft seems to put it as an image editing software which can be a lighter alternative to the likes of Photoshop and Illustrator.        Powerpoint 3D:   PowerPoint is an essential tool for business; representing concepts, showing statistics or anything business oriented. Now Microsoft has embedded few 3-D features in the PowerPoint, enabling you to put 3-D objects from Paint or the 3-D clip art library in your presentation and make it position better which you couldn’t do with a 2-D object. This will make presentations more effective by representing concepts and contents in 3-D.\xa0 Microsoft will be rolling out 3-D features in all of its Office Suite.  Game Broadcasting and Tournaments:   Microsoft’s recent acquisition of the game streaming service  Beam  will be inbuilt in the Microsoft Creators Update. This will allow users to seamlessly broadcast and access gaming sessions and provide interactive tools to communicate with the viewers. For private sessions, it will also allow users to create their own tournaments and all of the users data and scores will be stored in the Xbox Live account. This update will definitely be a delight for gamers.  People in your taskbar(My People):   Microsoft Creators Update will allow users to put friends,family, and co-workers in the taskbar. Along with these people, you can associate their email, skype id and Xbox live to start with. You can directly drag and drop files on the taskbar to send it to the individual people. You’ll also see direct emails, IM’s and shared files right on your taskbar. This is a pretty convenient feature and will help out a lot to stay connected with the persons that matter the most.

['Hackers are gaining access to your smart devices!'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['October 26, 2016']",2016-10-26 01:47:47+00:00,"['Internet of Things (IoT)  devices can be controlled through apps and internet. We can control  Xiaomi Yeelight , a light bulb that is an IoT device, by an app to change its colors and intensity of light. Similarly, cars can communicate with garage doors to open them, and by sensing the proximity of a person, a thermostat can adjust room temperature by sensing how close a person is. In nutshell, these devices can communicate with each other helping their users.  These devices are making their way to Nepal, and their popularity is gradually increasing.  IoT devices are assigned with IP addresses so that they have the ability to transfer data from one device to another over any network. But this is exactly what makes them vulnerable. A report states that over 70% of IoT devices have vulnerabilities such as Insecure Web Interface, Insecure Network services, Privacy concerns, Insecure Cloud Interface, Insecure Mobile Interface, Insecure Firmware, etc.        These vulnerabilities allow hackers and government agencies to take control of connected devices for any purpose. And given people’s dependence on IoT devices, they are slowly losing the ability to make it secure.  Brian Krebs, a reporter at Krebson Security, was a recent victim of DDoS.  DDoS or Distributed Denial-Of-Service  (per Urban Dictionary) is a form of an electronic attack involving multiple computers, which send repeated HTTP requests or pings to a server to load it down and make it inaccessible for a period.  That attack wasn’t just a normal DDoS attack. It was measured at 620 Gigabits per second, and Krebs said, “many orders of magnitude more traffic than is typically needed to knock most sites offline.”  What attacked Brian Krebs wasn’t just a group of hackers. It was something different. All this was done by a botnet, a different-than-other and powerful botnet. And Hundreds of thousands of devices connected to his IP address [routers, IP cameras, Digital Video Recorders (DVRs), laptops and computers, printers, etc. used for sending a huge volume of data] helped.  [Kaspersky defines botnet as: ‘ an interconnected network of computers infected with malware without the user’s knowledge and controlled by  cybercriminals . They’re typically used to send spam emails, transmit viruses and engage in other acts of  cybercrime . Sometimes known as a zombie army, botnets are often considered one of the biggest online threats today. ’] The botnet used in this attack is “Mirai”. It can scan devices connected to the internet with default username and password. Take a Linux computer for an example. Mirai can easily login to the computer if its username and password haven’t been changed from ‘root’. Or if anyone uses an Internet Protocol camera, with username as ‘admin’ and password as ‘password’ itself, it can easily find the credentials and add the device into the botnet.  How does Mirai work?  First, Mirai scans IoT devices and then attempts to log in into these devices by using different login credentials. If it succeeds, those devices are added to the Mirai botnet. With billions of devices connected to the internet, the possibility of Mirai bypassing login credentials is significant.  Talking about Mirai, Rob Simon, a senior security consultant at Trusted Sec, said, “ This is the big thing they used to create that botnet .” “ There are 50 or so known types of devices, and they’re listening on telnet port 23, and they have the credentials. You just copy over the code to run on that device, it connects back to a control center, and from there it just waits for your commands. Once all connected, about 380,000 devices are connected at once. You send a command to all of them to go load a page like Brian Krebs’ and they’re generating a lot of traffic ,” he added.  Consequently, once hackers take control over devices, they can be changed from sending normal amount or volume of data to and from your computer to sending an abnormal amount of data to a single place. As Technobuffalo writes, ‘Ultimately, the traffic from hundreds or thousands of these devices can exceed the throughput available to a website or a service, denying additional requests access.’  How to stay away from IoT and DDoS attacks?  There are no antivirus softwares for IoT devices.  We are really lazy when it comes to updating the software or applications in our devices. We ignore popups asking us to update firmware. When was the last time you updated the firmware of your router?  Malwares are used to include computers inside of botnets. Antivirus softwares are fighting these malwares, and Microsoft has upgraded its security in Windows 10. However, these softwares are still unable to scan malware that can our webcams. Therefore, updating firmware is really necessary.  Changing a device’s default password into something complex is a simple but an effective step. Firewalls too can be helpful.  Currently, we are witnessing an amazing progress in the field of technology but Internet of Things and Distributed Denial-Of-Service\xa0are its unanticipated consequences that show no signs of stopping. Therefore, we need to act as soon as possible before we hear the DDoS attack like the one in an episode of ‘Black Mirror’ happens in Nepal.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iot-hack.png']

Mi Note 2  In terms of photography, the phone is equipped with a 22.56MP rear camera ( Sony IMX318 sensor\xa0 )which lacks laser autofocus and Optical Image Stabilization but offers electronic stabilization while shooting 4K videos. You also get an 8MP front facing Camera with f/2.0 & autofocus, which is a rare feature you get to witness\xa0but is something a flagship phone should possess. So, the front-facing camera is supposed to get you some really sharp and focused images. It also comes with a neat feature which makes sure no one in the image is blinking. And finally, backing up this phone is a generous 4070mAh battery which comes with fast charge 3.0.         The base model of Mi Note 2 with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage will go on sale for  $413   and the higher variant with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage is priced at  $490 , which is a hard price to beat which gets you the most admirable design and top of the line specs.  Xiaomi Mi Mix- Concept phone with Edgeless display :  Mi Mix  The future of smartphones is edgeless! As years passes by, the only visible change in a\xa0smartphone\xa0is the size of the display and their screen to body ratio, which is getting larger with every new phone in the market. Xiaomi today, along with the Mi Note 2 revealed their concept phone with a bezel-less display. The phone will have the screen to body ratio\xa0of  91.3%   which is totally insane, the latest flagship phones like iPhone 7 has 67.7% and Google pixel at 71.2%.  We really despise large bezels on our phone but they are there for a reason like the top bezel holds the earpiece and sensors while the bottom portion contains, charging unit and speakers. So it’s really difficult to imagine a phone without bezels. Xiaomi has placed\xa0piezoelectric speaker that uses the metal frame to generate sound as the earpiece and have used ultrasonic proximity sensors. But the bottom chin is here to stay and it will hold the front facing camera which is rather a strange place but you can flip the phone to take a normal selfie.   The phone will flaunt a massive 6.4inch display with curved edges which will be a complete beauty . Mi Mix will be powered by the Snapdragon 821 processor and will come in two variants: 4GB RAM with 128GB Internal storage and 6GB RAM with 256GB Internal Storage. It will feature a 16MP rear camera and 5MP front facing Camera and it will be backed up by 4,400 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0.  How does a concept phone have so many specs already pre-determined? Because the will no longer be a concept on November 4th! Mi Mix will start selling in China for the price of  $516   for the base version and  $590  for the high-end version.  https://youtu.be/uiutj90dqAU']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/xiaomi_1477377633621.jpeg']

['Are We Disposing Our Phone the Right Way?'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['October 24, 2016']",2016-10-24 10:14:14+00:00,"['Ever wondered what happens to your smartphone after it reaches the end of its life cycle, is no longer usable and you dispose it? How well is e-waste managed in Nepal? Are the practices safe and hazard-free? And what the future holds for us? Gadgetbyte answers these questions that every phone user might have had at one point in time in the following article.  With newer faster phones being launched each week all over the world, people are upgrading to better devices even if their older phones has not yet reached the end of its useful period. That in turn directly means more e-waste is being generated than ever before. This is clear from the data published by EPA (Environment Protection Agency-USA) which says that 11% of the total universal electronic waste consists of mobile phone wastes.  What really happens to the various components of a phone? Almost all countries in Europe, North America and the developed part of Asia have  recycling centers  (e.g. www.ervifone.com, etc.) for phones. Manufacturers are also required to set up a phone disposal plant/unit that manages and salvages old phone components – similar to what Samsung is doing with its Note 7 units. Phone parts are either plastic, metal or glass. Reusable and easily salvageable plastic and metal components are segregated and melted.        As different grades of alloy metal and level of plastic types vary from one phone brand to another, it is difficult to process all sorts (brands/models) of the phone in one single recycling unit. This problem particularly shows the need for individual phone manufacturers to owe up to this responsibility and set up a channel so that old phone that they have manufactured finds its way back to them. But there is little chance of this ever happening and companies are more focused on pushing newer products into the market rather than spending operational and logistic resources on waste management. Little over than 30% of all mobile phone waste are recycled properly with the fate of the rest of the 70% still unknown.  What about the batteries then you might wonder? Well, the main challenge always is (and has been) the safe disposal of batteries. Not only do they contain carcinogen (cancer causing substances) but the harmful chemical has the potential of permanently damaging the ecosystem if not disposed or reused properly.  New devices have high powered rechargeable lithium-ion (or similar technology) batteries contain rare earth elements. These metals (nickel, cobalt, lithium-elements) have limited ores which will be used up soon if it is not handled properly. As devices are getting slimmer-bigger, this technology (battery) is being used excessively than ever before. While almost all countries have a set of Environment Protection Acts (EPAs) and rules in place to govern the safe disposal of such battery wastes, little is known or done to properly monitor the execution of battery disposals, especially in poor countries.  What happens if such metals and hazardous wastes are not disposed properly? In the case of third world countries like Nepal where the waste management system still do not segregate waste properly, an old battery or an LCD screen will end up in a landfill site; if that is it makes it to one. Lithium batteries if thrown in a landfill in a charged state, heavy equipment operating on top could crush the cases and the exposed lithium could ignite a fire. Landfill fires are difficult to extinguish and can burn for years underground. Gradually the chemicals from devices contained mercury, acids, and other active metals seep into the soil or are washed off the surface of the soil and make their way into water aquifers. The geology of land mass anywhere is such that liquid finds its way through the soil to some sort of water source- whether it be a water aquifer pocket few feet below the ground or a catchment area sooner or later.  Contaminated water source means any living organism subjected to it will develop cancer cells. An entire ecosystem of the catchment area that has a high concentration of such metals will stop yielding any life form at all. Soil will lose its ability to support growth and after a few years, the entire area will turn barren and hazardous. In the case of low concentration dosage over a long period, an entire demographic region can be affected with health issues and unsafe living conditions.  So what needs to be done? Someone that has an old phone that they need to get rid of, has no option but to sell it to a phone shop at a salvage price or just throw it off at a dumpster not knowing where it will end up. E-waste management in Nepal is something that either the government has to do at a policy making level or phone companies need to step up to stop this potential environment hazard. As an informed user, one can properly read the instruction on the battery or the phone manual and follow the instruction as to how to dispose of the battery. In the long run, managing phone waste will turn out to be a major headache if it is not properly dealt with in time.

A new study has found out that lithium ion batteries can expel off noxious gases that can harm our health and could even be fatal.  The research was conducted by scientists and researchers from Institute of NBC Defence in the United States of America and Tsinghua University in China mentioned. They said that many people don’t know about the consequences of overcharging.        In the present time, lithium-ion batteries power many electronics, ranging from smartphones to electric cars. These batteries power almost two billion new devices each year. So, it is necessary for us to know about the effects and risks associated with the batteries.  During their research, the scientists heated up nearly 20,000 lithium-ion batteries to the point “you would expect if the battery overheats or is damaged in some way”. This resulted in the production of up to  100 harmful gases including the deadly Carbon Monoxide . Some of those gases have the potential to cause irritation to eyes, skin and nasal passages while some have the potential to kill people.  Dr. Jie Sun, lead author and professor at the Institute of NBC Defence, said, “ such dangerous substances, in particular carbon monoxide, have the potential to cause serious harm within a short period of time if they leak inside a small, sealed environment, such as the interior of a car or an airplane compartment .”  “ We hope this research will allow the lithium-ion battery industry to continue to expand and develop with a greater understanding of the potential hazards and ways to combat these issues ”, Dr. Sun added.  This research has shown another dark side of the ‘viable energy solution’ – lithium-ion batteries. These batteries not only give off noxious gases\xa0but are also prone to catching fire and exploding. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the perfect example of this. So, to overcome all this, researchers need to come up with techniques for ensuring the safety in using lithium-ion batteries before something goes terribly wrong.

['ZTE Blade V7 Lite Review: A budget smartphone worth your money'],"['Reviews', 'ZTE']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['October 19, 2016']",2016-10-19 10:13:57+00:00,"['As more and more Chinese OEMs launch their smartphones in Nepal, we get to see some good budget phones in the market.  ZTE  recently released ZTE Blade V7 Lite, a budget oriented device. Priced at Rs. 18,990, the company claims that the device is the best one in the price range. The device has a full metal unibody design and houses a snappy fingerprint sensor. But is the device worth spending your hard-earned cash on? Is it really the best device under the price range? We will find that out in this review.  Design  I loved the ZTE Blade V7’s design the first time I saw it. It sports a sleek design with a full metal unibody. The device feels premium and rests comfortably on hands. Kudos to the Munich Design Centre for designing such a good-looking device. The metal back is by no means a fingerprint magnet and the compact body makes one-handed use easier. The device is really light and weighs at 135gm, which is surprising for an aluminum body.        1  of 6                                                                              Display  The ZTE Blade V7 Lite has a 5-inch 720 x 1280 pixels HD display with 294ppi. Even  though 720p doesn’t sound good on paper, the display is sharp and clear. However, it doesn’t get very bright on outdoor lights.        The thick black band surrounding the display has to be the most annoying feature of the device. Other than these, the screen of the V7 Lite is quite good and its wide-angle viewing is decent as well.  What i didn’t about the phone is it’s prone to scratches as it lacks any kind of protection. However, the company has included a Nano protector (better version of Tempered glass) inside the box.  Performance  The ZTE Blade V7 is powered by a MediaTek MT6735P Quad-core processor clocked at 1.0GHz that is backed by a Mali-T720MP2 GPU and 2GB of RAM. Talking about the device’s performance, the Blade V7 Lite lagged only when I had lots of stuff going on in the background while playing high-end games.        1  of 3               Antutu Score         Geekbench Score         Quadrant Score                      So, if you are a moderate user, this could be a perfect device for you as it is pretty responsive and does its works smoothly even though the loading time is a bit longer. But for a device of this price range, it does a nice job. The device did get a little warm around the camera after around 20-30 minutes but it’s not something you need to worry about.  Software  The ZTE Blade V7 is running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MiFavor UI on top. The UI lacks an app drawer. I installed a custom launcher since I had a hard time managing apps. Other than these, the software department of the device is quite well and lag-free.        1  of 7                                                                                        Hardware  Moving on, the camera bump at the back is not so big. At the front, the V7 Lite features off-screen navigation buttons that are backlit. And yes, it also features an actual headphone jack! At the back, there are two speaker grills but only one of them actually works (like the ones seen on iPhones and Nexus 5). The speaker is mediocre and not very loud. It can be easily covered when using the device.   There’s not much of a choice regarding the ZTE Blade V7 Lite as it is available in only one storage option. The device has 16GB onboard storage and 10.68GB is available to the user. The device does come with an option for expandable storage up to 64GB which is sufficient, at least for me. The downside is that you need to choose between your extra SIM and a microSD card.  Camera  On the camera department, the ZTE Blade V7 Lite features a 13-megapixel rear facing camera and a 8-megapixel front facing camera. Both cameras are equipped with flash.   The camera shoots average in well-lit areas but it’s a decent bargain for a phone priced below Rs.\xa0 19,000. However, it is quite poor in under-lit areas. The pictures come out too noisy and over-exposed almost every time. There is a pro mode where you can adjust ISO, Exposure and shutter speed, but that doesn’t add to the quality of the picture. It also can’t focus properly on objects that are in some distance.        1  of 6                                                                              The camera takes selfies with a little noise but the front facing LED flash helps under poorly lit settings. However, if you’re looking for some point and shoot camera that can capture some decent macro shots, the Blade V7 Lite will do the job for you.   Fingerprint  The fingerprint scanner is one of the major selling points of the ZTE Blade V7 Lite. It is responsive and really snappy, something you wouldn’t expect in a phone of its price range. I could unlock the device without any hiccups. The fingerprint scanner is housed on the back of the device, right below the camera.   Connectivity  The ZTE Blade V7 Lite has a dual hybrid SIM slot, i.e. SIM+SIM/microSD card. It supports a micro SIM and a nano SIM. Furthermore, it also supports 4G connectivity. Other connectivity options include WiFi b/g/n (no dual band, ac), GPS, Bluetooth, and FM Radio.  Battery  ZTE Blade V7 Lite has a 2500mAh battery. Since the device sports a 720p display, the battery lasts long. Under heavy usage, which consisted of constant gaming, web browsing and watching videos, it got me a screen-on-time of 4-5 hours. Therefore, if you are a moderate user, the phone will last you a full day and will probably give you more than 5 hours of screen on time.   The only complaint I have about the battery is that it takes around 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%. For a battery that small, it shouldn’t take such a long time to charge.  Conclusion  For me, the ZTE Blade V7 Lite is one of the best devices under Rs. 19,000. It is equipped with a snappy fingerprint sensor, one of the best aluminum body and a lag-free UI. The battery lasts long and the camera is good for point and shoot in well-lit conditions.   Overall, the ZTE Blade V7 Lite is a decent device for Rs. 18,990. And if you spend your hard-earned money on this device, you won’t regret your decision.

According to the Korean News outlet Nemesis, Samsung may release only one flagship device annually to ensure their flagship’s quality. Simply saying, Samsung might ditch their smartphone market strategy in favour of quality of the products they manufacture.  Many people believe that Samsung’s decision to release the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 before Apple released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is the main cause of the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Samsung has always had a tight schedule since it releases two flagships in a year. And now it is rumoured that Samsung could change its strategy for an effective and a tested flagship.  Not only that, it has also been reported that Samsung is halting and scrapping some of its Research and Development products because of lack of funds. The company could possibly lose $17 billion in potential revenue because of the Galaxy Note 7 crisis.        An official from one of Samsung’s partner firms said, “Samsung has not notified its suppliers of the plan to scrap the current two-flagship models strategy, but if so that could impact the parts suppliers to some extent.”   “For now, everything is up in the air about what Samsung will do to recover from the recent fiasco involving the Galaxy Note 7, but it will certainly make changes to its current marketing strategy and product portfolio”, the official added.  Please note that this is just a rumour and Samsung hasn’t said anything about this matter. Do you think Samsung is making the right decision if this rumour turns out to be true?

No matter how high-bandwidth internet connection we have, some web pages are made in hell, with all their ads and unmanaged databases, which take ages to load. So that’s all about to change now, Introducing the  Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) .  Google AMP is a way to build web pages for static content, well that’s a bummer right? Cause all the slow pages are usually dynamic! But it’s a start and the development of AMP is continuous. AMP is somewhat similar to the instant articles that you see on Facebook.  For starters, it is a great way to boost traffic to your website.\xa0 If your web pages load fast and the contents it has to offer are just that good, then you’ve hit a jackpot. Also, the  AMP pages appear on the top of Google search list!  If your site is based on WordPress, you have a  plugin  to convert your web pages into AMP. Any static web pages can be converted to AMP using simple HTML codes, to do so, you have to either create an alternate version of the web page for AMP or convert the whole website to AMP. Google provides a cache that can be used by anyone for free, and all AMPs will be cached by the  Google AMP Cache .         To this day, over 600million AMP documents have been created by some major sites like eBay, Reddit, Shopify, WikiHow to name few. The speed is possible because of the Google’s Cache Server and also many restrictions that you have to put in your web page, to make it load faster, like most of the Javascript is not allowed, you cannot use certain HTML tags like forms, and you have to use streamlined version of CSS. So yeah! a lot of restrictions, but in the end, it’s totally worth it.   We have already seen traces of AMP in Google search here in Nepal as well. AMP uses 10 times fewer data than the non-AMP pages. Previously it was limited to Top Stories section on Google search, but now it is included in all Google mobile searches. To know it’s an AMP page just look for the bolt icon like in the Facebook Instant Articles.  AMP is insanely fast, it takes no less than a second to view a web page.  The Ads are still there but they won’t be affecting the performance. Now this has got me really excited, what if all the web pages could open this quick? But the downside to all this, is that, all of the web pages will be stored in Google’s server, so, Google will be controlling all of that data which raises questions for privacy!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Google-AMP-Logo.jpg']
['iPhones and Apple devices? No thanks'],"['Apple', 'iOS', 'Opinion']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['October 17, 2016']",2016-10-17 01:38:31+00:00,"['Apple released the  iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus  last month amid massive fanfare, and a misdirected and deceptive attention. The company has again showcased its product in such a way that people are ready to lose anything just for the sake of buying them. Last year, two Chinese men were reportedly set to sell their kidney, just for the sake of buying iPhone 6s. It probably won’t be long until we will get to read news related to iPhone 7s and kidneys.  The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus went on sale over 3 weeks ago, and as always, we got to see people line up to buy the device. And all this because of what? Hard sell! Apple always makes their customers believe they are missing out on huge stuffs if they don’t buy their products.  I’m not saying Apple sells sub-standard products. All apple devices are well-built, and look sleek. The app environment and ecosystem is good too. All this is coupled with a good service. So, if you buy any apple devices you won’t have to suffer any problems related to quality and service.        But is quality and service enough for the pricing of the devices Apple makes? Is the pricing of the iDevices completely justifiable?   Take a look at the price iPhones are currently being sold in Nepal. The newly released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are available for pre-order right now. The cheapest 32GB variant of the devices will cost you Rs. 92, 550 and Rs. 113,550 respectively. Likewise, the iPhone 6s is priced at Rs. 87,000 for the 16 GB variant while the older iPhone 6 Plus is priced at Rs. 88,000 for the same storage option. The three-year-old iPhone 5s is being sold for a whopping Rs. 55,000 for the 16GB version which shows how high iPhones that are well into their life cycles are valued.  The total manufacturing cost of the iPhone 7 is only $224.80 (Rs. 23,938.925). Considering this, the selling price of the device is way too high. Yes, Apple has to pay for marketing price, but isn’t the $649 selling price too high?  If some hardware-based specifications are taken into consideration, the midrange devices in the price range of Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 have similar specifications to the iPhones of these days. Yes, I know these devices aren’t realistically similar by any means, but does it make sense to pay six times more for a device that can’t be justified by its own hardware?  Some people might say that iPhones aren’t just about the hardware, arguing that the software experience is a greater factor for the complete experience. Yes, the software experience is great. But some android devices nick iPhones today. The interface is a mess, there is very little customization available, and the file transfers is complex, all thanks to iTunes. The iPhone users might find this to be wrong, but that was my verdict after I used iOS.  Another major problem: A friend of mine had to pay Rs. 94,000 just for changing the display of his MacBook. Another friend had to pay Rs. 60,000 just to change the logic board of her MacBook Air. Not only this, simple stuffs such as power adapters of MacBook will empty your pockets.  Apple isn’t trying to convince people to buy its products; it wants everyone to be included in its own program. And the lines of people standing outside Apple stores to buy their absurdly expensive devices tell the tale.  I am happy to let Google show ads here and there in exchange for the excellent software and customization experience I get to choose, that too from a wide variety of smartphones. I’m happy to stay away from iPhones and all other apple devices. But hey, if it’s not an iPhone it’s not an iPhone.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/apple_logo.png']

"['People who take selfies: narcissists, lonely and psychopaths']",['Opinion'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['October 14, 2016']",2016-10-14 13:16:00+00:00,"['‘But first, let me take a selfie.’ You probably hear this every day, or even say it yourself right before the holy act of taking selfies. Thanks to smartphones, selfies have been a part of our life for a while now. But researchers and scientists warn that taking selfies or being a selfie addict could be associated with loneliness, vanity, and an act of getting approval of others.  You definitely know a certain someone who is always taking pictures of themselves, no matter what the occasion is. Selfies at home, in the office, at parties, selfies when they are alone and the list goes on. Not only that, that person’s Facebook or Instagram is an endless compilation of selfies. (Note: If you do not know that person, it might be you.)         Simply said, people are addicted to taking selfies these days. While many of us enjoy the act, it could make us insane if the urge isn’t taken care of sooner. Let’s take an example of 21-year-old  Danny Bowman .\xa0 His story of selfie addiction is quite shocking. Danny was addicted to taking selfies when he was 19. Believe it or not,  he used to take up to 200 selfies each day  on his iPhone. Over the next six months, he didn’t leave his house, and eventually dropped out of school. Danny used to spend 10 hours a day trying to take a perfect selfie.  As his frustrations grew when couldn’t click that perfect picture, he attempted suicide.  Danny Bowman became frustrated that he couldn’t take an ideal selfie. So he tried to kill himself.  A research was conducted in over 1,200 men and women by psychologists from Poland and Germany. The results showed a  connection between self-esteem and selfie posting among men . Those who thought highly of themselves tended to post more own selfies, although there was no relationship between self-esteem and the frequency of posting group selfies. [Sorokowska A, Oleszkiewicz A, Frackowiak T et al. Selfies and personality: Who posts self-portrait photographs?  Personality and Individual Differences . 2016] One of the lead authors of the study, Agnieszka Sorokowska wrote, “ On the one hand, people with high, stable self-esteem might be eager to share their photos because they are not susceptible to criticism. On the other hand, people with low self-esteem might be even more willing to engage in online self-promotion in order to raise their self-esteem .”  Likewise, a research conducted on men by Ohio State University concluded that  narcissism and psychopathy in a person resulted in the total number of selfies shared . [Published online in the journal  Personality and Individual Differences ] Another research published in ‘ Scientific Research ‘ revealed that the time people spent on using Facebook, going through other people’s profile, watching videos and even the way they view their own Facebook profile was linked with high levels of narcissism.  Researchers in Thailand recently conducted an interview with 300 students which mostly constituted of females aged between 21 and 24 measuring narcissism, selfishness, loneliness and attention-seeking characters. [ Published in  Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace ]  They later found that intensity of usage of social media and selfie-liking was directly associated. In an interview with Daily Mail, Dr. Peerayuth Charoensukmongkol, lead researcher, said,  “Individuals with higher degrees of loneliness tend to report selfie-liking to a greater extent. Taking selfies allows individuals to control what other people see in the photos, it is not surprising that those who exhibit these narcissistic characteristics tend to like selfies because it helps them achieve this personal goal.”  If you’re worried that you could be addicted to selfies,  look out for the following signs  ( source: carteblanche )   You can’t make it through the day without taking at least one selfie.  You spend a lot of time thinking about selfies, planning where and when to take them.  There are instances when you simply cannot fight the urge to take a selfie, no matter how hard you try.  You often find yourself taking selfies when you’re meant to be doing something important.  You’ve realized you’re taking too many selfies, but can’t get yourself to cut down on the amount.  You are almost obsessively checking to see how many people like your selfie and you take it personally when there’s little or no response.  Taking selfies has interfered with your social life and relationships.  You start to think about everything you do as a possible selfie.  You feel better about yourself or more important when you post a selfie.   Although it may be little less hurtful than online bullying, trolling and other online crimes, it is important to acknowledge the addiction to taking selfies as a disorder in this transitioning connection between human beings and technology. We all know we have been narcissistic enough to check how many likes our selfies reached. Let’s hope that we use social media wisely and not have too many Dannys.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/huawei-gr5-mini-review-1.jpg']
['Here’s Why Apple Removed the Headphone Jack on iPhone 7'],['Apple'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['October 14, 2016']",2016-10-14 06:17:22+00:00,"['Photo credits: theweek.co.uk                  When  iPhone 7  was launched a lot of questions were raised for the Apple’s move on removing the historic 3.5mm jack for its new device. To address this issue Apple’s marketing chief had stated that “It really comes down to one word: courage. The courage to move on to do something new that betters all of us.” But if one digs deeper, ‘courage’ doesn’t seem to be the right word for this new step.  Apple claims the main reasons to be; courage to advance into wireless technology. The jack was said to be removed to create more space on the phone so that new features can be added .And lastly, Schiller described the Air Pods as small, lightweight and easy to connect and stated “vision of how audio can be”.         But the benefits for the consumer do not seem that promising. The connection is now made through a \x1blightning port which makes most of the headphones incompatible and one requires a small adapter to connect other wired headphones. Also one cannot connect the wired earpiece while charging. The removal of 3.5mm jack doesn’t look overwhelming to the users. Apple has not introduced a wireless charging which has become a common affair in flagship phones today but removed its 3.5 mm jack. The big WHY still exists?   I phone 7 doesn’t come with any wireless headphone .The AirPods have to be bought separately and it sells at a whopping $159.And Apple currently owns Beats,the\xa0 number one Bluetooth headphone company. Beats announced three new wireless headphones; the Solo 3 Wireless ($299.95), the Powerbeats 3 sports earbuds ($199.95), and a neck-wraparound called the Beats X ($149.95).Both Airpods and Beats will certainly make the most out of this situation.  More to that, any company that manufactures Lightning headphones has to pay a royalty fee for the Apple’s licensing to make the product. Apple gets a cut on Lightning headphones no matter who makes and sells them.   The reasons are speculative yet factual. \xa0So to explain the reason behind the current scenario, ‘Courage’ doesn’t seem to fit the case but ‘strategic business decision’ may be more accurate.\xa0 At present, the removal of 3.5 mm jack does imply a win but the win appears to be more inclined towards the Bluetooth headphone companies rather than the consumers.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/iphone-7-no-jack.jpg']

The OBI MV1 runs on CyanogenMod and is priced at Rs. 15,695.\xa0Today, I got to play with the OBI MV1, albeit for a little while. My initial verdict covers all basic stuff I noticed while using the device.  Design and Display  OBI MV1 clads on a Polycarbonate plastic body. I found the device’s design to be distinct from other smartphones. It has slightly rounded off and straight edges on the bottom and top of the device respectively. The device is tall because of the big bezels below and above the display, and the 5-inch screen itself.         It feels good on the hands and has a little bit of weight to it. The OBI MV1 is one of the rare breeds, \x1bthough. It has a removable back and a removable battery. Other than the battery, the removable back gives access to dual SIM slots and a microSD card slot. At the top, the device features a metal frame along with a headphone jack.   The device features a floating display, i.e. the screen rises slightly from its base. It sports a 5-inch 720p HD display with 294 for the pixel per inch. The floating display is covered by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It is bright and has a good viewing angle. I will test the display properly in the MV1’s full review.  Camera  OBI MV1 comes with an 8-megapixel rear facing camera and a 2-megapixel front facing shooter. The rear camera, as expected, performs well in well-lit areas. It suffers under poor lighting and the pictures come out a bit noisy. The front facing camera is average but shoots some social media worthy selfies.   Performance  OBI MV1 is powered by a Qualcomm MSM8909 Snapdragon 212 Quad-core processor clocked at 1.3Ghz. The processor is paired with Adreno 304 GPU and 2GB RAM. The device runs on an older CyanogenMod 12.1.1 version on top of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box. The software is stock-ish and is equipped with some useful tweaking apps like AudioFX and CM Theme Engine. The device has some customization options that will surely help in making your usage easier.        1  of 6               The Obi Worldphone MV1 runs on Android 5.1 with CyanogenMod 12.1.1 OS         The CyanogenMod offers Theme Pack         The True Caller App is integrated in the dialer                                                   Battery  OBI MV1 is supported by a 2500mAh removable battery. The battery will probably last a day under normal usage. Even if it doesn’t, it won’t really be a problem as it is equipped with something faster than Quick Charge – the option to replace the battery.   Other features  Like I already mentioned, the removable back gives access to dual SIM slots and a microSD card slot. The OBI MV1 supports 4G connectivity too, thus making your device future proof. MicroSD card can expand the device’s 16GB onboard storage up to 64GB.  Conclusion  OBI MV1 is a unique looking device that comes with CyanogenMod preinstalled at the price of Rs. 15,695. If the device can handle all tasks without any lags, then I think it could be one of the best devices of its price range. It packs some decent specifications on paper but we will be testing that in our full review.   Don’t forget to follow Gadgetbyte Nepal for the in-depth review of OBI MV1.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Obi-worldphone-MV1-scaled.jpg']

DESIGN  Huawei GR5 Mini comes with a metal body with a brushed finish to be precise, which looks very premium.

The camera produced nice quality photos with enough details.        1  of 4                                                          The front camera was also able to produce nice pictures. The photos can be clicked by using the finger sensor. The camera did falter in low light but at this price segment, you should hardly complain. The camera performance was significantly more than what was expected with any phone in this price segment.   FINGERPRINT  The fingerprint sensor of Huawei GR5 Mini is placed at the back below the primary camera. Its size and position seem suitable to serve it purpose. One can store up to 5 fingerprints. The fingerprint is very fast and accurate for its segment. It works almost every time unless the fingers were wet or dirty. The fingerprint sensor extends its function.   With several other functions, from unlocking the phone, it can be used to unlock the desired apps, click pictures, attend a call, stop the alarm, access notification panel and even swipe the photos and much more. This particular feature was very interesting to use.  CONNECTIVITY  The phone comes with a 4G connectivity and dual sim feature in hybrid SIM slot form. So one cannot expect to use the SD card while using the two SIM simultaneously. The call quality and reception were descent. The phone comes with Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and Wi- Fi but not a dual band Wi-Fi. I have been using the phones since past month and I haven’t come across any issues with the call quality and network reception.   BATTERY  Huawei GR5 Mini comes with a non-removable 3000mah\xa0battery. But it doesn’t support fast charging. It takes more than 2.5 hours to completely charge the phone to from less than 5% charge. But the battery performance is good for a daily use. Even after a day of decent use like\xa0Social networking, YouTube, attending calls and camera, the battery has no issues. The battery does get heated while charging which seems like a normal case for any smartphone today.   CONCLUSION  Huawei GR5 Mini is an efficient compact-sized device. The hardware-software optimization has smoothened the overall performance here thanks to 16nm FinFET technology used by the HI Silicon Kirin 650 processor.   The phone doesn’t seem to stand out in any particular feature. But again, it definitely doesn’t disappoint you in any unlike phones that woo us in the specifications but disappoint in usage. Many phones in this segment have a tendency of standing out in different features while bringing hidden low featured attributes in the hands of the user. But Huawei GR5 Mini brings all that is needed for a decent\x1b usage with this price point.

['Weird tech: Control your dreams with a £245 iBand+'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['October 9, 2016']",2016-10-09 03:04:06+00:00,"['We have always fantasized dreaming what we want to and how we want to, like in the movie Inception. The way Ellen Paige created a world of her own, a world which had several gravitational fields, we have always wanted to do that. I mean who wouldn’t love to control their dream to their liking?  Arenar, a start-up company from Amsterdam, looks set to turn this fantasy into reality with its invention – iBand+. The company claims iBand+ can help create lucid dreams, allowing them to ‘fulfill any fantasy and experience’ they want. The wearable can also help people sleep and maintain their sleep cycle.  Basically, the headband not only helps in inducing lucid dreams but also your sleeping cycles all while monitoring heart rate, body movement, and temperature through special sensors. Need to listen to some music before sleeping? The iBand+ smart app can then play music based on your habits.        iBand+ is a Bluetooth wireless device that has multicolored LED lights.  The flickering LED lights on the headband will make you realize you’re dreaming, helping you control your dreams. Arenar has described iBand+ as ‘a truly smart wireless Bluetooth EEG headband’ that can sense brain waves with laboratory level accuracy.  Now let’s talk about sleeping and dreaming. Our sleep cycle consists of two main phases – Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. REM sleep is the phase in which people have vivid dreams while NREM sleep is the phase in which people are easily awakened by something.  According to Daily Mail, ‘During REM sleep, the muscles in our arms and legs are temporarily paralysed, which is thought to be a neurological barrier to prevent us ‘acting out’ our dreams.’  The iBand+ starts its work in the REM phase by playing audio-visual signals through the headband’s LED and pillow speakers.  iBand+ gives video and audio cues through the LED lights and pillow speakers.  The makers at Arenar said, ‘These subtle external stimuli of light patterns via the LEDs on headband and sound from the pillow speakers appear as anomalies in your dream making you aware that you are dreaming without waking you up.’  The iBand+ will cost you £245. And no, iBand+ and Arenar are by no means associated with Apple!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/video_screen2_720x405.png']

The phone is available from different  offline retail stores   and  SastoDeal.com  — the company’s online partner for the product.  Unlike the previous two phones,  OBI SF1 and OBI SJ1.5 , the OBI MV1 runs on Cyanogenmod. The phone looks somewhat like the OBI SF1 and also sports the floating display. For a budget phone, the device looks absolutely stylish as the phone is targeted for the youth.         OBI MV1 comes with a 5-inch Fully Laminated IPS display with the resolution of 720*1280 pixels and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. It has an oleophobic coating which prevents the display from fingerprint and smudges and Sunlight display which provides better screen readability under direct sunlight.  The phone has substantial weight to it at\xa0149grams, and the body comes with UV coating and smudge-free matte finish. Powering the device is the Snapdragon 212 chipset which is a 32-bit Cortex A7 quad core processor clocked at 1.3 GHz. You get 2GB of RAM for multitasking. Performance wise, the phone should be okay to handle regular day to day tasks and few mid-range games. Backing up the device is a modest 2,500mAh of a removable battery,\xa0which may last you on a full day of usage, taking the specs into consideration.   “We’re thrilled to launch Obi MV1 in Nepal during this festive season; Obi has always strived to bridge the gap between high design – high price. With our clutter-breaking, design lead approach, we stay committed to making the Obi Worldphone a consumer’s delight.”- Neeraj Chauhan, Co-founder and CEO of Obi Worldphone.   Talking about the camera, the phone comes with an 8MP rear camera with flash and 2MP front facing Camera. OBI MV1 also comes with 16GB of internal Storage which can be expanded up to 64GB via a dedicated Micro SD Card slot. The phone also sports a Dual Mic for noise cancellation and DTC sound that amps the speaker’s profile and fine tunes audio for an immersive headphone experience.  The Obi MV1 is currently available in White Color option, but the Red and Black variants should also arrive in 2 weeks time.  The phone is powered by CyanogenMod 12.1.1 on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop (upgradeable to Cyanogen 13.1). The CyanogenMod is most part stock-like, but you get a handful of extra tweaking options like Audio FX, CM Theme Engine, in-built True Caller app, and other optimizations to enhance\xa0your smartphone experience. Connectivity wise, the phones comes with dual-SIM(4G+3G), Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS. The phone is also 4G enabled. OBI MV1 is equipped with Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor, and Accelerometer, but Gyroscope sensor is missing.

But today we have got a common product that we’ve all heard of, a Smart LED Bulb. Xiaomi’s Yeelight is a small affordable bulb which you can control with your smartphone.  The Xiaomi Yeelight is a color changing bulb and you can also change the light intensity depending on the mood you’re trying to set. You typically need a different amount of lux in a different environment. Like while reading and going for bed, one would normally prefer dim lighting, and while doing other activities you may prefer harsh lighting and you can set the bulb brighter of dimmer accordingly. The Yeelight is designed to produce the same light effect you see in an art gallery so it really creates a good ambiance when you turn it on.         The light takes 8W power with a color temperature of 4000K and will last 25,000hours. To use the bulb, you just have to screw it in place and use the Yee Light app from your smartphone, your app will search for the smart home kits and once it finds the Yeelight bulb you’ll have to connect it via your wifi.  It is a really affordable and convenient replacement to your ordinary household bulb. This bulb is built\x1b to last with overheating and lightning proof, not to mention it is also less power consuming. Most importantly you can turn on and off the build via your app so you don’t have to get off your lazy ass to turn on or off the switch.

Maybe Nokia is taking it’ s time to perfect the phone this time, as the stakes are high for Nokia. We’ve seen phones render images and the name supposedly rumoured as  Nokia P1 .   Having used Nokia since a very young age, people are excited that their beloved brand is finally entering the smartphone market. It’s not the specs that excite\xa0us, but the brand itself. \xa0A flagship phone in 2016 can’t have bad specs, so the Nokia P1 also stands in the crowd of all the flagships in 2016 which feature the similar hardware specifications.        Based on the leak from China, the Nokia P1 will sport a metal body featuring a  2K AMOLED display , will feature either  Snapdragon 820 or 821 , will come with standard 4GB of RAM or higher (if Nokia is giving all out), the phone will be running on latest flavour of Android,  7.0 Nougat  with the  Nokia Z launcher\xa0 on top. Most importantly it is  IP68  water and dust resistant so the toughness of Nokia still remains intact. The camera details haven’t been out yet, but it will have graphene material in the module which will help a lot in low-light imaging.  So the fun part is, there’s gonna be Nokia P1 of two sizes, one with 5.2inch display and one large with a 5.5-inch display, but most of the specs will remain the same despite the screen sizes. Also, the comeback from Nokia isn’t small, leaks in China suggests that Nokia has a whole bunch of Smartphones in the pipeline, which they’ll release before the end of 2016.

The replaced sets are said to be free from any issues. But yesterday, a replaced Galaxy Note 7 caught fire on an airplane. No one was harmed in the accident as the plane had not taken off and all passengers were evacuated safely and the flight was cancelled.  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was supposed to be Samsung’s best-selling device \x1band a proper rival to Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Instead, it became the company’s worst nightmare, something it direly wants to forget. And even with all the replaced devices, Brian Green’s new Galaxy Note 7 caught fire when the plane was getting ready for takeoff. Green later confirmed that he had picked up his new device on September 21 st .  Talking to  The Verge , he also mentioned that his Galaxy Note 7 had a green battery icon, and showed a picture of the device’s box which contained the black square symbol. Samsung has added black square boxes in all of the new Galaxy Note 7s that have are from the replacement batch.        According to Green, his phone started to smoke after he had powered down his device which had 80% charge remaining. He then dropped it on the floor and a ‘thick grey-green angry smoke’ began pouring out of it. The device burned through the carpet and scorched the subfloor of the plane.  The Verge  even ran the device’s IMEI through Samsung’s recall eligibility checker to determine its safety, and the website said the device wasn’t affected by the global recall.  Well, just because a device catches fire once in a blue moon, it doesn’t mean that its whole batch will have the same problem. Recently, an iPhone 7 caught fire, but that doesn’t mean all iPhones will catch fire. But we are talking about the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 here, and obviously, a lot of people looking forward to buying the replaced ones will have second thoughts.

And  Coolpad Group Limited , a Chinese company that will be officially arriving in Nepal in new weeks time, is set to continue this trend.  One of the largest smartphone companies in China, Coolpad Group Limited is actually a telecommunication company that sells telecommunication equipment and smartphones among others. It is the largest Chinese domestic brand by sales outside of China.  Talking about the company, the Coolpad Group Limited got its name at the end of 2013. Previously, the company was called Yulong Computer Telecommunication Scientific Co. that sold smartphones under the name ‘Coolpad’ brand. The company was founded in 1993 and has been on the rise ever since.        In the last decade, the company has succeeded in being one of the leaders of mobile operating systems, radio frequency, protocols and wireless data decomposed transmission technology, etc. in China. Not only this, the company has also been a major smartphone seller outside of China in respect to the Coolpad brand. From January to June 2012, the company had a market share of shipments of 10.4%.  The Coolpad smartphone brand speaks innovation too. The Coolpad Group Limited is set to release a device with an actual  frameless display . When asked about the technology, the company said, “ this patented technology can render the visual effect of a smartphone’s screen to be completely frameless through a manufacturing process while delivering a seamless, edge-to-edge visual experience to the end users’. Basically, there will be no frame around the device. This is sure to be an absolute enticing display” .  This Coolpad device will be a frameless smartphone.  So, we are getting to see another budget-oriented smartphone manufacturer make their sales in Nepal. A new smartphone brand lining up to topple the established Chinese brands Huawei and Gionee. Coolpad will join the newly launched Meizu, HTC and the not-so-new ZTE in an attempt to make an impression in the Nepali market. And if the company prices their products right unlike some brands here in Nepal, it will slowly have a fair share of the smartphone market.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Logo-baru-Coolpad.jpg']

Google Search is pretty good at finding what you are looking for these days, but sometimes they still come up short which makes you to use\x1b other search engines (we’ll discuss about other search engines some other time). For this case, there are few little tips and tricks which come handy and help us to use Google Search effectively. So here are some tips for better googling-  Exact phrase  The simplest and most effective way to search for something specific is to use quote marks “…” around a phrase or name.        Exclude terms  If you are not getting what you need then you can specifically exclude certain words using the minus sign.  Asterisk wildcard   Searching a phrase in quotes with an asterisk replacing a word will search all variations of that phrase. It’s helpful if you’re trying to determine a song from its lyrics, but you couldn’t make out the entire phrase.  Searching between two values  Searching for something with a qualifier between two ranges is a good way of answering questions. For instance, if you’re looking for the who were the Nepali prime ministers between 1920 and 1950 a search using Nepali prime minister 1920.. 1950 will bring up results with dates ranging between 1920 and 1950.  Search for the related sites   The related qualifier is useful for finding similar sites. Searching for related:abc.com \xa0for instance, will bring up the websites of other news organizations that Google deems the most similar to the ABC.  Definitions   You can put define: in front of the word that you want the definition of.  Calculator   For quick math problems, don’t worry about opening your calculator app. Just type the equation into Google using +, -, *, / and parentheses for basic functions.  Unit Converter   Just type what you are looking for in a sentence with the units you have and want.  Some other tips and fun tricks are listed below in the table. Use without the quote marks.     Function  Execution    To set a timer  Enter “set timer for” followed by the desired amount of time    To check the weather for a specific area  Enter\xa0“weather” followed by a zip code or city    To look up the time for a specific region  Enter\xa0“time” followed by the particular region    To look up your IP address  Enter\xa0“my ip address” in the search bar    To roll a six-sided die  Enter “roll a dice” in the search bar    To compare between foods  Use “vs” between two foods    Play Atari\xa0Breakout\xa0by searching it on Google Images  Just search “Atari Breakout” on Google Images']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Google-Search-in-nepal.jpg']

This is a great achievement for any platform to have such a huge base of user profiles. Facebook is a global\xa0conglomerate and people all over the world use its services, and the messenger is the most used app from Facebook besides WhatsApp. But in the developing countries where internet connection are poor and people only use basic android devices, Facebook Messenger usually becomes unusable. So to tackle this problem and to expand the reach of messengers in every part of the world, Facebook today announced the trimmed down version of Facebook Messenger, the Messenger Lite as its campaign to connect the next Billion!   Messenger Lite  is a slimmed version of the Messenger app without any compromises on the facility it provides. The Lite app has both SMS and messaging configuration, stickers, files, and other multimedia support. The app is just under 10MB so it is faster to install and operates more quickly. Not only that it also supports older devices, so my guesses are up to the devices that run Android Kitkat.        We have seen a similar release from Facebook earlier, the Lite version of the Facebook app, which has been successful to connect people with basic android devices. We all know how resource hungry the Facebook app and the Messenger app really is, which drags down the performance of our device. So the solution can be the lighter version of these apps,  Facebook Lite  and Messenger Lite. Both of these apps will also be useful when you’re not in a Wifi zone or you’re low on your data packs.  Messenger Lite is starting to roll out to people in Kenya, Tunisia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Venezuela.

Evolution Enterprises , the official Distributor of ZTE mobile phones in Nepal, aims to cash in on this trend with its newly launched ZTE Blade V7 Lite. A toned-down version of the Blade V7, the Blade V7 Lite is a proper a bang-for-buck device. It features a  full metallic compact body , sporting a 5-inch HD display with 294ppi. The front of the device is covered by a Corning Gorilla Glass. This device is currently priced at  Rs. 18,990.\xa0  Before anything, I’d like to mention the build quality of the Blade V7 Lite. Even for a device under Rs. 19,000, a metallic body is well built and feels premium. Moreover, the fingerprint sensor, as the company claims, will unlock the device under 0.3second and using it for an hour, it works really well.\xa0I unlocked the device with no hiccup at all.        At today’s Bloggers meet, I got to play with the Blade V7 Lite for some time and here are my early verdicts.  Build and Display  One of the best features of this device is its build. The V7 Lite feels like a premium device with its unibody metallic design. It is light and compact that makes one-handed use much easier.   The device features a 5-inch IPS LCD 720 x 1290 pixel HD display with 294ppi. This display is covered with a Corning Gorilla Glass and I was impressed with the device’s wide viewing angle. However, the screen is a fingerprint magnet so applying a tempered glass is recommended. The only downside of the device is an annoying thick black frame that surrounds the screen.  Camera  The Blade V7 Lite is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear facing camera, paired with a decent 8-megapixel front facing shooter and a front facing LED flash –a perfect fit for selfies. The camera performs really well in well-lit areas. However, it suffers in low-lit areas, just like most other budget phones. The picture comes out bright but really grainy. We will test the camera properly in our full review.  Performance  Under the hood, the ZTE Blade V7 Lite is powered by a Mediatek MT6735P Quad-core processor and 2GB RAM. This processor is paired with a Mali-T720MP2 GPU. It runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow with the MiFavor UI on top. Everything worked smoothly when I used the device for a while. However, it took me some time to get accustomed to the lack of app drawer, but this problem can be solved by downloading a launcher.   Battery  The ZTE Blade V7 Lite is backed by a 2500mAh battery. It will surely last long because of the device’s 720p screen. We will be testing the battery properly in the full review.  Other features  The device can run two SIM at the same time and supports 4G connectivity as well. However, since it has a Dual Hybrid SIM port, you need to choose between using two SIM at the same time or using a single sim and a microSD card.

['6 Reasons Why People buy iPhone'],"['Apple', 'iOS', 'Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['September 27, 2016']",2016-09-27 01:53:44+00:00,"['iPhones have been the mark of achievement, simply owning an iPhone is a matter of pride to many people. If you truly love something, the price is never an issue, same story here with the iPhone users. Apple has one of the largest base of loyal users, most of which are based solely on the iPhone. Why is it so? Why do people love their iPhones so much? Let’s point out some obvious things that make iPhone better:  Premium Build:   It’s undeniable that iPhones have one of the best build quality compared to any other high-end smartphones out there. The comfort you feel while using it and the premiumness you feel while holding it is totally beyond par. Apple claims only the best materials are used while manufacturing the iPhone, despite the “bend gate” we witnessed with the iPhone 6, but nonetheless, the problem has been solved and the frame of iPhone has been made stronger than ever making it elegant and sturdy. Simply, iPhones are one of the most beautiful devices out there.        Software Upgrades:   if you’re an android user, you already know how much frustrating it is to wait for Android updates for your device and on most of the cases, despite few security updates your device never really gets any software update to the latest version of Android. But that’s not the case with iPhones, all of the iPhones receive the updates at the\xa0same time and the updates are consistent as well. You always get to experience the new changes in the software and the bugs are fixed faster. The latest update of iOS 10 supports up to\xa0iPhone 5 which was released in 2012. It is simply amazing for how long you get the update for your iPhone.  Simplicity:   iPhone was made popular in the first place because of its simplicity. Everything you need is right on the home screen or no further than 2 or 3 touches away. The phone has just a single home button, nothing fancy like a separate, back and recent buttons. You can unlock your device, get to home, view recent apps and make the window accessible all with the single button. The quick toggle from the bottom is real handy and the notifications are much more interactive. iOS really take minimalism\xa0to a whole new level. More than \xa0anything, iPhone is a utilitarian device, all you want to do is get the things done without much of any complications.  Performance:   The performance was never an issue with the iPhone, as both the hardware and software are\xa0designed by Apple, they sync very well. Even the lightest resource can handle the iOS properly, so, not until\xa0recently, iPhones always had the clock speeds and RAM of what we considered as a midtier in Android devices. Even now, the latest iPhones come with just 2 or 3GB of RAM while the Android counterparts have already started flaunting 8GB of RAM. Chips used in iPhones are getting powerful year by year, they can easily handle anything thrown at it without missing a beat and most importantly they are much more power efficient.  Resell Value:   You see the shiny new Jet Black iPhone 7 and want it so bad, but it hasn’t been a year since you’ve purchased the iPhone 6s. Well, there’s nothing to worry about, if your phone is in good condition, you get a reasonably\xa0good amount of price while reselling your device and maybe invest in a new one. And if you had an Android device, the story would’ve been much different, after a year or so you get almost half the price of what you paid for the device.  Better App Environment:   \xa0  If you’ve used both android and iOS, you know exactly what I’m talking about. The apps on iOS are much more curated than the Android counterparts. iOS has better app environment and are less sluggish and further feature rich. Most of the popular apps first get developed on iOS and later shifted to Android. Prisma is a relevant example.The layout and functionality of the app overall on iOS are much better and intuitive.

['Overcharging: Does it destroy your smartphone’s battery?'],['Opinion'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['September 26, 2016']",2016-09-26 14:31:24+00:00,"['Photo credits: ANDROIDPIT                  If you change your phone every two years or so, you don’t need to worry about the topic I am going to discuss.  Many of us change our smartphones every now and then, and when we do this, we don’t really notice the battery’s decline. But if we use it for a little longer, our battery capacity decreases exponentially.  Some of us think that leaving our phone charging overnight will damage our battery while others think it is okay to leave them charging overnight. However, it actually depends on circumstances you’re leaving your phone in.        But, I have to mention one thing. Smartphones are equipped with chips that can protect devices from excess charging once they are fully charged. So, overcharging can’t really harm your devices, unless under certain circumstances.  I have to mention that most smartphones make use of a technology that makes battery accept current faster. Such technology allows power to pulse into the battery in specific modulations, increasing the speed at which the lithium ions in the battery travel from one side to the other, causing the battery to charge quicker.  The same technology, however, tends to slowly damage the battery via chemical actions. Basically, because of this fast charging, our battery’s condition deteriorates. Note that fast charging here doesn’t refer to the Quick charging capabilities phones have. They simply refer to your battery charging faster than usual. You should also keep your phone’s temperature in mind. Explaining smartphones and their heating, Apple says, “Your device is designed to perform well in a wide range of ambient temperatures, with 62° to 72°\xa0F (16° to 22°\xa0C) as the ideal comfort zone. It’s especially important to avoid exposing your device to ambient temperatures higher than 95°\xa0F (35°\xa0C), which can permanently damage battery capacity”.  So how can you stop the deterioration of your battery? It’s simple actually. If your original charger charges your battery faster, use another charger that will charge it slower. Or think of it this way, if you use your iPhone’s charger to charge your iPad, your iPad will charge slowly. Charging your electronics this way could actually save your battery’s life. Furthermore, keep your phone’s temperature in check. Don’t let them overheat. This will make sure that your phone’s battery doesn’t go downhill.  Finally, if you change your device every two years, you need not worry about this because batteries start showing signs of wearing only after two years.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ANDROIDPIT-battery-5-w782.jpg']

Since then, the company has started to replace the devices that have been sent back. But, it looks as though the problems of the Galaxy Note 7’s battery will still exist in the new devices.  According to the South Korean TV network YTN, customers are facing new battery problems in their replaced devices. YTN has reported that the new Galaxy Note 7 devices are overheating and quickly losing their battery power even when charged.  However, these cases have been reported only in South Korea until now. Samsung had started dispatching the replaced Note 7 in the country since September 19.  A beast of a device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is facing many problems since its release.  A user in Korea claims that he went out with his Note 7’s battery at 90%. But in a short period of time, the battery percentage went down quickly to 50% and overheated. Similarly,  in a more serious claim , another user says that his Galaxy Note 7’s battery is draining at the rate of 1% per second, even when the device is being charged. He also mentions that his phone’s battery never reaches 10% even when he leaves it plugged in all night.        When asked about the issue, a Samsung spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that the issue is “completely unrelated to batteries”. He also added that the incidents are isolated cases and Samsung are conducting close examinations.  Samsung recently stated that it has already replaced almost 500,000 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in the USA alone.

['Say Allo to Google Allo: Now Available in Play Store'],"['Android', 'Apps']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['September 21, 2016']",2016-09-21 08:57:58+00:00,"['Good news, people. Google has finally released the  Google Allo  app today! For those of you who do not know, Allo is basically a  text-messaging app  with a twist – it has tons more features than what any other messaging apps feature.  Google had announced the apps  Allo and Duo  at Google I/O this year. The company had released Google Duo couple of months back. Duo is a simple video chatting app. It sports a simplistic design, and more importantly, people can see each other’s video without even receiving the video call. So, all in all, it’s probably the fastest video chatting app there is. It uses your smartphone’s contact rather than your gmail. I personally don’t use it because only a few people in my contact list have installed the app which is a bummer.  What is Google Allo?        Google Allo is basically a text-messaging app that is sort of  equipped with an in-built intelligence . Google made this app because of the failure of Hangouts. And looking at its feature, Allo looks set to be a hit. It could prove to be a competition for the messaging apps like Apple’s iMessage, Viber, and Facebook’s Whatsapp and Messenger.  Google released the app in a time when the fore mentioned apps have been people’s choice for a long time. Google looks to counter this with a solution: Allo’s in-built  Assistant . This Assistant is the core to Google’s strategy in making this app a hit. Also, you can talk to the Assistant itself. The app also features ‘ Smart Reply ’. The feature will be able to suggest you replies to particular texts. A creepy but a nice feature indeed. As time passes, it will adapt to the way you reply to people and suggest you replies in that manner.  Here are all the top features of Google Allo:   Smart Reply  Smart Reply can understand any text and suggest you replies  Like I mentioned before, this app offers Smart Reply – a feature that can quickly understand what the respondent has replied and suggest you a reply for that. Google showed this feature in Google I/O. Let me explain this by an example. When someone sends you a picture of a dog, you probably reply by typing ‘awww’ or ‘cute’. So, with Smart Reply, the app instantly suggests you these replies. And not only that, the app will also suggest you something like ‘nice picture of a German Shepherd’ or a reply similar to that. Smart Reply here read the picture, figured out the breed of the dog and suggested you the response. Google has said that Smart Reply will become smarter and will be able to suggest you phrases and sentences as time passes. A weird feature that will come handy.  Assistant  The Assistant is Allo’s core function.  Assistant is another important feature of the Google Allo. It will assist you when texting by suggesting you about the topic you’re talking about. In Google I/O, it was shown that when you text someone with like ‘I’m hungry’, it will instantly show you the restaurants near you. You’ll also be able to play games Google is currently providing. The Assistant will also be able to perform basic ‘Google Now’ functions like setting a reminder. You can also talk to the Assistant like you do with Google Now or Siri or Cortana, which is sure to be fun.  Incognito chats   There’s an incognito mode in Allo for secure messaging.  You have probably used the ‘Incognito’ feature in Google Chrome. Google Allo has been equipped with the incognito feature which sort of does similar work. When you enable this feature, your messages will be encrypted end-to-end and no one will be able to hack into your chats and read the texts. You will also be able to set an expiration date for the messages according to your needs.  Whisper and Shout   You can emphasize or deemphasize your texts.  Ever had to give an angry response to someone using all capital letters? Or ever had a situation where you wanted to reply something like you would do when whispering? Google Allo solves all this problem with its ‘Whisper and Shout’ feature. You can simply make the size of the letters in your replies bigger or smaller, depending on the situation. Emphasize your text by enlarging your words, or deemphasize them by making them smaller. Replying has never been this easy! You can simply exercise this feature by pressing and holding the send button and sliding it up or down to increase or decrease your text size.  Stickers and Scribbles  You can scribble in your pictures and send stickers in Allo,  These are the features other messaging apps already have. You can basically reply someone with the stickers, similar to that of Viber and Facebook Messenger. And just like in Viber, you’ll be able to scribble something in a picture you’re about to send.  Google has promised that the all the texts are secure and the messages will not be stored it in its server. The company hasn’t released the app in Nepal at the time of my writing. You can find apk files of Google Allo too, but it’s up to you on whether you want to download it officially or unofficially. You can currently  register for the download of the app  once it is available.  All in all, Google has brought a lot into the smartphone world with the release of Allo and Duo. Allo, in particular, certainly looks promising but we have to wait to see how it will fair in the real world.

By the looks of it, the DTEK60 looks to be BlackBerry’s flagship device for 2016. The DTEK60 is a probable premium update to the cheaper DTEK50 that the company had released back in July 2016.  According to The Next Web, Blackberry published a document unintentionally in its website which had most of the information about the DTEK60. The device, Codenamed Argon, packs high-end specs a phone of 2016 would usually pack. The DTEK60 will sport a 5.5-inch QuadHD display. It will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 64-bit chipset and a Quad-core processor, and will be equipped with 4GB RAM and Adreno 530 GPU.  The document has stated the device to have 32GB of onboard storage. However, it hasn’t been mentioned whether the device will feature a slot for expandable storage or not. Also not mentioned in the document is the Android version the device runs on. It will be a good move for Blackberry if this device can feature Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. \xa0But it will probably run Android 6.0 Marshmallow.        Camera wise, the DTEK60 will be equipped with a 21-megapixel rear facing camera and an 8-megapixel front facing camera. The device will also feature USB Type-C connector that is capable of fast charging as it is enabled with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. Also, the DTEK60 will be the first BlackBerry device to house a fingerprint sensor. All this will be run by a 3000mAh battery.  BlackBerry DTEK60 could share its design with the DTEK50.  Here’s all you need to know about the leaked specifications of the BlackBerry DTEK60:     DISPLAY  5.5-inch 2560 x 1440 pixels display    CHIPSET  Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 64-bit    CPU  Quad-core processor    GPU  Adreno 530    OPERATING SYSTEM   Android (Version Not Available)    RAM  4GB    INTERNAL STORAGE  32GB    EXPANDABLE STORAGE  Not Available    QUICK CHARGE  Available (Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0)    FINGERPRINT SENSOR  Available    BATTERY  3000mAh    PRICE  Not Available     Note: The specs of the BlackBerry DTEK60 could be different once it is released.  If specs are considered, the BlackBerry DTEK60 looks set to be a decent device to buy. It could also give smartphones from bigger companies a run for their money. But we all know specs aren’t the only things that determine the quality of any device. On paper, this device looks like a decent flagship, but it could all change once it is released and people get their hands on the device.  It’s commendable that Blackberry is changing itself. Last year it was ditching BlackBerry’s own Operating System for Android, and a\xa0few months back it was disbanding the physical keyboard with the DTEK50. But it could all go wrong with this device like it has been for previous Blackberry devices. So, BlackBerry needs to focus on making the device secure, powerful and fast with a good camera and no bugs or lag. Only then will it rise.

According to recent reports, Google is set to disband the Nexus name this year. Several sources have said that Google is going to name its new phone  Pixel , replacing their legacy – the ‘ Nexus ’ name.  This year Google is set to unveil two new devices. It had been previously reported that these phones will have codenamed\xa0 Sailfish  and  Marlin . They will now be called  Pixel  and  Pixel XL  respectively. Rumor mills have been circulating for some time now stating that this year’s OEM is HTC.  The phones’ design had previously come under criticism because of the huge bezel present below the screen. But the recently leaked images show that the bezel is a tad bit smaller than previously rumored. I personally think HTC should have opted for dual front-facing speakers instead of the downward-facing speakers. This would have made a use of the bezel whilst providing great sound quality.        Google is set to remove the Nexus branding in their new phones.  Talking about the devices, Sailfish is a mid-range budget-friendly version while Marlin is the flagship device. \xa0Both of the phones will have Android 7.0 Nougat installed out of the box. But unlike previous years, these devices won’t be the first phones to run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box as LG V20 is set to take that honor. They will now feature a Google logo on the back (i.e. no Nexus logo).

He detected the bug on August 29 and reported it to the Facebook security team. One of them wrote back to him the very next day saying how his discovery helped them to prevent a massive security breach. The team fixed the bug by September 6 and after three days Arun got a mail from them informing him of their decision to reward him.        Facebook had invited him along with three other hackers from different countries for a meeting with its security members at Las Vegas. He was also awarded the tenth place in the Facebook’s hall of fame of the white hat hackers. He is the only Indian to be honored in the website’s hall of fame.

As you may know, Google Play services are capable of constantly tracking Android \xa0users’ movements because it uses features like nearby\xa0to create “location awareness.”  As Google explains in a blog post:-        “One of the unique features of mobile applications is location awareness. Mobile users take their devices with them everywhere, and adding location awareness to your app offers users a more contextual experience. The location APIs available in Google Play services facilitate adding location awareness to your app with automated location tracking, geofencing, and activity recognition.”  In other words, Google Play’s APIs are responsible for this continuous tracking, not Android’s location APIs.  That means if a mobile user with one of the newest Android builds tries to switch off location for Google Play (Apps > Google Play Store > Permissions), they’ll get a pop-up window warning them that turning location off for Google Play will disable that feature on every single app installed on their device.  What if you uninstall Google Play and/or Google Maps?  You won’t be tracked but you’ll have to manually update each of your apps. Some app might not even work anymore without the installation of Google Play services.   According to the recent reports, Google has acknowledged that was a bug and stated:-  “We identified a bug affecting a small number of users in a recent release of the Google Play. For users in the error state, the Google Play app was unable to obtain GPS, causing it to make frequent unsuccessful requests and use the battery. We will be rolling out a fix in the next few days.”  [socialpoll id=”2387712″]']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/google-nepal.jpg']

And it certainly looks like HMD global (or HMD), the company set to release the Nokia-branded phones, will release two new Android-powered devices by the end of 2016. And if some rumors are to be believed, the company might release three mobile phones. But first, let’s talk about HMD.  HMD is a new Finnish company that has struck a deal with Nokia to use the Nokia-brand on phones. So, the Nokia that is releasing, isn’t made by the old Nokia company we know. Currently, Microsoft has the sole rights of all types of Nokia phones. But that deal is going to end in the second half of 2016. After this transaction ends, HMD will be the sole global licensee for all Nokia-branded products for the next decade.  In a press release, HMD said, “the remainder of Microsoft’s feature phone business assets, including its Hanoi manufacturing facility, and global distribution, fulfilment and supply chain networks, will conditionally be acquired by FIH Mobile Limited (FIH), a subsidiary of Hon Hai Precision Industries (trading as Foxconn Technology Group). HMD has signed an agreement with FIH and Nokia Technologies to establish, on closing of the Microsoft transactions, a collaboration framework to support the building of a global business for Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets. This agreement will give HMD full operational control over sales, marketing and distribution of its Nokia-branded devices, with exclusive access to the pre-eminent global sales and distribution network to be acquired by FIH from Microsoft, as well as access to FIH’s world-leading device manufacturing and engineering capabilities, and its growing suite of proprietary mobile technologies and components”.        HMD has also mentioned that the company’s board will consist one Nokia representative. And it will be investing $500 million dollars in the next three years.  The phones that will be released will be packing lots of features. If rumors are to be believed, HMD will release two new flagship phones. They will sport a 5.5-inch and 5.2-inch quadHD AMOLED display. These devices will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 821/820 chipset with octa-core processors. Nokia phones’ camera have been nothing short of amazing in the past and the trend is set to continue with these devices. These phones will feature a 22.6 MP graphene camera. They will be running on Android 7.0 Nougat. The larger version will run on 3GB RAM while the smaller version will run on 2GB RAM. Please note that the specs might be different once the device is released.  New Nokia phone’s rumored design.  One of the devices is rumored to be named Nokia C1 while the other device’s name isn’t known until now.  I am really excited about an Android-powered Nokia phone and think that it will be a hit. People all over the world have loved Nokia for a long time and it has a lot of history. But the journey will sure be extremely hard for HMD. The company needs to make a powerful device with a price that can fit people’s budget or it could fail miserably like Blackberry, or Nokia itself.

['Researchers: AirPods might be emitting harmful radiowaves'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['September 13, 2016']",2016-09-13 17:25:29+00:00,"['Apple released the sleek designed AirPods- in an event held in San Francisco.  But the AirPods have started come under controversy, and it is not because you can lose them just by looking at them. Public health experts have warned that these wireless earpods could be life threatening.  AirPods use Bluetooth technology for their functioning.  AirPods are sleek looking; water resistant wireless device and they can perform multiple functions. The wireless device uses Bluetooth technology. It houses a W1 wireless chip inside to powers the device. The chip is the main reason why the AirPods can perform such functions. But when in use, they emit non-ionizing radiation or low-intensity radio waves. Research shows that these radio waves are capable of wearing down the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier in our body helps in keeping out chemical toxins that are harmful to our body.  The Federal Communications Commission or FCC is an independent agency that regulates sectors related to communication in the United States of America. This organization has set certain guidelines related to the level of radio waves emission.\xa0 Apple has insisted that it has followed the guidelines since it uses Bluetooth in the AirPods. However, they have not released the exact frequency of the Airpod Bluetooth emission.        Talking with  Daily Mail , Dr. Joel Moskowitz, a professor at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, said,  ‘We are playing with fire here. You are putting a microwave-emitting device next to your brain.’  Researchers have long been warning about the radiations resulting from exposures to cell phone, and this news is just as concerning. While the AirPods are an amazing piece of technology, they can be detrimental to public health. Therefore, until Apple tells us about the exact frequency of the Airpods Bluetooth emission, it is safer to not use the device for a time being.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Airpods-7.jpg']

Mid-rangers and budget end smartphones are more severely affected as they are more prone to lag and stuttering. So today in this “How To Section” we are telling you the some of the secrets (not really the secrets) to speed up the Android performance so that you may feel your phone perform better than earlier.  Make Your Android Up to Date  Earlier versions of the Android are more prone to bug than the latest version. You may know that the latest version contains bug fixes and general improvements which help your Android device to run faster. If the system update is available, it tends to come to \x1bOTA (Over The Air) and you are automatically prompted to install them. But you can always check if the update is available or not by going to the Settings > About device> Software update> Check for updates.  Also, check your installed apps have an \x1bavailable update or not by going to the installed apps in Google Play Store.        Uninstall the Unused Apps  It’s not worthy to keep the app that you never use. It only consumes your storage and eats system resources. So, it’s better to uninstall those apps you don’t use. While some of the apps can’t be uninstalled but there’s an option to disable them and you can again enable them if you change your mind in future.  Clear Cached App Data  Cached data for apps help them to load more quickly but it can build up over time to take up quite a lot of space and there will potentially be cached data in there for apps that you no longer use. So, sometimes clearing cached data for an app can help to perform your device better.   Wipe Cache Partition  The cache partition is separate from your app data cache and it contains temporary files. It’s nice cleaning this out every once in a while. You’ll have to boot into recovery mode to do it. The method of entering recovery mode varies depending on your device, but you’ll find it easily with a quick Google search. Once in recovery mode, you use the volume keys to navigate and the power key to select an item.   Perform a Factory Reset  If any of the methods listed above does not boost your Android performance, then it’s time to reset your device which cleans junks and erases all data in the \x1bphone. So, before performing a factory reset make sure to back up everything that you need.   Overclock Your Device  If you are willing to root  Everything You Need To Know About Rooting an Android Device  then you can overclock it using SetCPU or Android Overclock which pushes the OEMs limit speed. If you are planning to do this then please proceed with caution.   Install a Custom ROM  Only the rooting your Android device does not make your device run like Usain Bolt but a Custom Rom can. What you need to do is just find the right Custom ROM for your device and do some research. Some other tips include turning off or reducing animations of your device (Windows Animation Scale, Transition Animation Scale, and Animation Duration Scale), turning off auto-sync, not using widgets in home screen and sometimes trying a third party launcher can also help a lot.   If your device is still lagging then it’s time to replace it with a new one.

['Potalyzer: A breathalyzer for marijuana'],[],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['September 11, 2016']",2016-09-11 01:53:44+00:00,"['Researchers from Stanford have revealed ‘potalyzer ‘ – a device that can measure whether people are under the influence of marijuana or not. The researchers have claimed that potalyzer can help the police as it provides the precise measurement of driver’s marijuana intoxication. But before starting this article, let’s talk about Tetrahydrocannabinol.  Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is a chemical substance that is responsible for the psychological effects that happen after the usage of Marijuana. There is a presence of Cannabinoid receptors in certain parts of our brain that are associated with thinking, memory, pleasure, time perception and coordination. THC can activate these receptors, and alter our thoughts, movements, concentration creating a euphoria-like feeling.  After marijuana is ingested or inhaled, THC molecule can also be found in saliva. This is when the newly revealed mobile device will come into effect. Police can collect a spit sample in a cotton swab, run it through some tests and get the results on their laptops and smartphones, in just three minutes. The device basically uses magnetic biosensors to detect the tiny THC molecule in saliva or spit. It simply works using magnetic nanotechnology, previously used as a cancer screen. And the potalyzer doesn’t just check whether a person is under the influence or marijuana or not. It can also check the concentration of its usage.        The device uses Bluetooth to communicate the results to laptops and smartphones  Potalyzer can reveal THC if their concentration ranges from 0 to 50 nanograms per milliliter of saliva. The researchers achieved such precision by harnessing the behavior of magnetism in nanoparticles, which measure just a few tens of billionths of a meter.  This device could be a major breakthrough as countries, where marijuana is legalized, have been trying to look for a device that can measure people’s marijuana intoxication as effectively as breathalyzer can work to check the level of alcohol intoxication.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3822A97800000578-0-image-a-6_1473460033532.jpg']

Unlike the CAN infotech where there\xa0is involvement of almost all the tech giants in some way or another, the first year’s CAN Commtech has proved to be nothing shy of boring. Despite all that, there are few attractions for tech geeks, and for someone looking for a new FTTH internet connection. Let’s get started:  SMARTPHONES: Where are All the Smartphone Brands?  You could only see stall of\xa0two smartphone brands at the CAN comm tech 2016: Samsung and ZTE. Both these brands haven’t launched any new products, however, they are offering some kind of discounts and freebies on their existing products.        1  of 2                                      Samsung is offering 3% discount on already discounted Dashain offer prices, and ZTE is offering 5% discount and free selfie stick on the ZTE Blade S6, Blade D2, and Blade D3. Both these brand shared their plans for the upcoming models. Samsung will be launching the J5 and J7 Prime in next few days, and ZTE is launching 5 new models next month.        Internet Service Providers (ISP): Everyone’s going gaga over the speed  If you are looking for a new internet connection, the CAN CommTech could well be\xa0an ideal place to visit. ISPs like Worldlink, Vianet, Websurfer, Subisu, and Broadlink are providing decent offers on Fibre connection and IPTV.        1  of 4                                                           Worldlink is offering 5Mbps unlimited internet speed with 1:4 sharing ratio for Rs. 1,800.  Vianet is offering free installation, 1-month BONUS, cash discount, and free ONU device for yearly subscribers.  WebSurfer is offering free installation,\xa0free ONU device, and cash discount.  Subisu doesn’t have any offer on FTTH internet service, but they are providing cable internet and clear TV combo offers.   Laptops: Solitary Acer  Just like the smartphone brands, the involvement of laptop brands were minimal and I could see only Acer laptops from Mercantile. They showcased Acer Switch Alpha 12 laptop which looks like a cheaper Surface Pro. Specs wise, it includes a dual-core i5 processor, 8GB of memory, a 256GB solid-state drive, and a keyboard case. They didn’t reveal the price, but it is expected to be priced at around Rs. 90,000.   Routers: Free Antivirus! What’s the catch?  Provider of networking products and solutions like Netis and Totolink are providing free antivirus on the purchase of routers. Beltronics, on the other hand, launches a new product. It’s a li-ion battery that provides 5 hours of backup for Wi-fi router.  Allocacoc Products: The WoW factor of CAN Commtech  Allocacoc, a household tech company that promises to replace your poorly designed multi plugs and power outlets, is offering a heavy discount on their products with free goodies and combo deals.

The new LG V20 is the first smartphone to feature Android 7.0 Nougat and will first be available in South Korea later this month followed by other markets in the coming weeks.  Like the V10, the LG V20 is all about the display and camera. It features a 5.7-inch IPS Quantum display with QHD resolution with a secondary display\xa0located right above its primary screen. The secondary display is now slighter bigger with a better brightness level of 513nits and a better resolution of\xa0160 x 1040 pixels. Just like the LG G5, the V20 features a dual camera setup: A 16MP primary camera with F1.8 Aperture OIS (Standard Angle) and 8MP secondary camera with F2.4 Aperture (Wide Angle). The camera is accompanied by LG’s hybrid AF system with laser detection AF, phase detection AF and contrast AF for fast and steady focus. LG has also included Qualcomm’s new Steady Record 2.0 EIS (electronic image stabilization) to reduce shakes and jerks while recording videos. As far as the front-facing camera is concerned, it houses a 5MP camera with\xa0f/1.9 aperture and\xa0120-degree wide-angle lens.         For all the audiophiles out there, the LG V20 could be an ideal smartphone since it now features an ES9218 32-bit hi-fi Quad DAC with high-quality speakers and sensitive mics. LG says that the updated audio system on the LG V20 eliminates background noises, ambient noise, distortion, and offers finer controls over the volume levels. With the new inbuilt recording app, the phone is capable of recording louder audio without any distortion —\xa0thanks to three mics built into the chassis. It also comes with Bang & Olufsen audio tuning and for a limited time, LG USA is offering customers B&O headphones bundled with the V20.   The LG V20 is the first phone to come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, and it’s layered with LGX 5.0+ UI. With the use of the secondary display, there are lots of features baked inside the UI like redesigned notification area and dynamic lock screens. On the hardware front, the phone is powered by the flagship grade Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM. It has 64GB of onboard storage with dedicated microSD card support upto 2TB.   The phone weighs 173gms and measures 7.6mm in thickness. It has a metal chassis\xa0that’s made of AL 6013, an aluminum-magnesium-silicon-copper alloy that is primarily used in airplanes. It is also US military MIL-STD-810 Transit Drop complaint, which means that it can survive a drop from the height of 4 feet. The back is removable giving the user access to a 3200mAh battery.\xa0LG V20 will be available in 3 color options: Titan, Pink, and Silver colors in South Korea. Pricing and availability of LG V20 in Nepal is unknown since there is no distributor of LG mobiles in Nepal. The phone could be available in grey markets sometime next month.

The users you ask? No, they are not grandparents or children. Celebrities, executives of different organizations and other officials use flip phones because of the growing privacy issues in smartphones. Plus, they probably like to talk rather than text.  These days, many people use smartphones. They are with us everywhere we go. Our important files, documents, and pictures are all saved in our smartphones. Now think what might happen if someone hacks into our smartphones and publicize everything. Yes, that’s the reason why people are switching to flip phones.        Not only that, flip phones are budget-friendly devices with great battery life and durability. You could drop it anywhere, on the floor or into a pool of water, and it could probably survive that easily. They are miles ahead of the smartphones of today in the ‘strength’ department.  And now, these flip phones are getting smarter too. Take a look at Samsung Galaxy Folder 2. It’s a flip phone that will have Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box with 8GB of onboard storage and a whopping 2GB of RAM. It will house the Snapdragon 425 chip with a quad-core 1.4GHz processor. The phone has a decent camera with an 8MP rear camera shooter and a 5MP front camera. It has been rumored that the phone might feature 128GB of external storage. It will run on 2000mAH of battery. Samsung has however not specified the release date of the device.  If leaks are to be believed, the Samsung Galaxy Folder 2 is a great flip phone.  Flip phones might never be as popular as they were before, or become our first choice device. But it’s safe to say that it still has a future, and manufacturers will continue to make the device more powerful as the years pass. And the to-be launched Samsung Galaxy Folder 2 proves my point.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CrQ9J9pVUAAa0Br.jpg']

The Xperia X Compact is a mini version of the Xperia X which was released in May, 2016. But it gets its looks and functions from Sony’s new flagship – Xperia XZ. The device is ceramic inspired, even though it is basically just made of plastic.  The Xperia X Compact features a 4.6-inch (720 x 1280 pixels) display at 319 ppi. Under the hood, the phone is powered by a Snapdragon 650 processor with 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of on-board storage with an external storage up to 256GB. It will support Quick Charge 3.0 and a USB Type-C reversible connector. Just like the Xperia XZ, it comes with a 23MP camera with an IMX300 sensor. Also, it even houses the same f/2.0 aperture with Laser and Phase Detection Autofocus. However, unlike the Xperia XZ, the front camera is of 5MP. It comes with a Non-removable Li-Ion 2700 mAh battery.         I think Sony has made a wrong decision here by featuring a mediocre 720p display. Although the price hasn’t been revealed yet, I think the device will be priced above $300. In the present time, you can get a sweeter deal buying a OnePlus, Alcatel Idol, Moto or ZTE. The 720p screen is a disappointment. But the 2700 mAh battery will last you long because of the same reason. Also, it could be a good choice for people who like compact devices.

This app allows the rooted Android device user to hide the root status on an app-by-app basis. It can selectively hide root (the SU binary) from other applications.  One of the drawbacks of rooting Android device is losing access to certain apps. Those apps include banking, payment and corporate security apps that work with financial and confidential data.

['Smartphone radiation: A major health risk?'],['Opinion'],['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['August 30, 2016']",2016-08-30 02:58:04+00:00,"['A couple of weeks ago, one of my teachers told me about phones emitting radiation when the battery level goes either above 90% or below 40%. My curiosity led me to research on this subject matter. Though I couldn’t find evidence to support his claim, I did learn about the radiations our phones emit.  Smartphones have become a major part of our life, something we can’t stay without. They help us get our work done with utmost efficiency and effectiveness. But with all that, there’s a probable dark side behind it – radiation and its health risks. Is this radiation something we should be alert about? Or is it something we can ignore? Today’s piece will be all about smartphones’ radiation and the health risks associated.  Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, be it highly ionizing or non-ionizing. The radiation that smartphones emit is non-ionizing ones. They include Radio Frequency and Extremely Low Frequency. All the radio signals, i.e. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and network signals are Radio Frequency while the phone’s hardware gives off Extremely Low Frequency. These radiations, when emitted, are absorbed by our body, particularly cells and tissues.         What happens when the radiation is absorbed?  As I mentioned earlier, these radiations are non-ionizing. They aren’t as powerful as UV-rays or any other highly ionizing radiation. So, if a short period\xa0of time\xa0is taken into consideration, they don’t really affect us.  However, studies have shown that these radiations might affect our brain’s activity, decrease bone density around the pelvis and even cause infertility among men in the long run. Some of the people also believe that smartphone causes cancer. Scientists are researching to study the association between smartphone radiation and cancer, but it hasn’t been proven yet. According to World Health Organization,  “TO DATE, RESEARCH DOES NOT SUGGEST ANY CONSISTENT EVIDENCE OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO RADIO FREQUENCY FIELDS AT LEVELS BELOW THOSE THAT CAUSE TISSUE HEATING. FURTHER, RESEARCH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AND SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS, OR ‘ELECTROMAGNETIC HYPERSENSITIVITY’.”  Smartphone Radiation and Infertility in Men  A research article published in the Reproductive BioMedicine Journal titled “Habits of cell phone usage and sperm quality – does it warrant attention?” on September 2015 has warned that men using their smartphones for more than a couple of hours are in a risk of “cooking sperm” and dropping the level of sperm. The study has mentioned that having a phone close to their groin or even body can lower sperm level. According to the research, 47% of the cases among the 106 men were affected by this problem. These men had reportedly kept their phones close to their groin or near themselves.  However, it can be argued that the study population of the research is less and cannot be generalized to a large population. Also, 26 out of the 106 were not included in the research because they were deemed ‘unfit’ to meet the criteria set. Different models of smartphones emit different amount of radiation and the study population didn’t use the same smartphone. In the past, decades there have been plenty of environmental factors that have affected the quality of sperm. And smartphone usage might not be the only cause of infertility.  How to stay safe from smartphone radiation?  Smartphone radiation is gradually becoming a Public Health concern globally. However, as I have already mentioned, if a short period of time is taken into consideration, the radiation isn’t able to affect much. But in the long-term effect, it could be harmful, and that’s something scientists and experts have been dwelling upon right now.  Scientists and experts have been actively researching to come up with evidence-based findings on the impact of smartphone radiation in human. Until then, we can stay safe by less usage of smartphones, keeping our phone in airplane mode when not in use, using headsets to receive calls, and not using our phone when it has poor signal strength since poor signal strength can comparatively induce more radiation.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cell-phone-SAR-value.jpg']

The article won’t become complete if we don’t discuss the must-have apps after rooting Android devices. That is why today we present our dearest readers and gadgets users five must have apps for rooted Android devices.  Xposed Framework [Price: Free]  It is one of the best root apps for Android for customizing the device to the fullest without installing custom ROMs. This app is all about theming, performance, tweaks, remapping, and UI customization inside app but you have to look the modules that are compatible with your device.        1  of 2                                      Lucky Patcher [Price: Free]  If you have been using Android for a long time, you might have heard about Lucky Patcher. After using this app everyone can enjoy the various tweaks like Remove Ads, Remove License Verification and so on. If you find others, please do comment below.         GravityBox [Price: Free]  One of my favorites, it allows us to tweak Lock screen, Status bar and Navigation bar. Not only these it has various other facilities like transparency management, general fixes display tweaks, power tweaks and the list goes on.   BusyBox [Price: Free]  BusyBox unlocks the many advanced root features. Those root features include better control and management of the Android device. It is simply a set of tools and libraries, used to support running various Linux commands on Android device.   Greenify [Price: Free / $2.99]  If your phone/device does not have nice battery backup, then you be sure to use Greenify. It improves the Android device battery life pretty amazingly. As we know that Greenify also works with unrooted device but there are many limitations in that. Undoubtedly being the best Android root app, it hibernates the background running apps to save the battery life.   There are many others best root apps like Adblock Plus, ES File Explorer, ROM Manager, Tasker, Xposed Status Text and so on.

['Top 7 Android 7.0 Nougat Features You Should Know about'],"['Android', 'Apps']",['By Anuj Bhandari -  '],"['August 27, 2016']",2016-08-27 07:50:06+00:00,"['Google released the final version of Android 7.0 Nougat this week, a couple of months earlier than what they did in previous years. This, however, was expected as Google started rolling out the beta version of Nougat a\xa0few months ago. This final version is same as the final development preview, i.e. Developer Preview 5. Google device such as the Nexus phones, Android One and Pixel C have already started to receive the Over the Air (OTA). Surprisingly, LG V20 will be the first smartphone with Android 7.0 out of the box rather than a Nexus phone.  In Android 7.0 Nougat, plenty of new features are added. In this post, I’m going to make a list of top new features that android 7.0 has introduced to the smartphone world. Please note that these features are not in any order.  Direct reply and Notification handling  There are some changes in the notification panel. Firstly, from now on, you can reply to any message from the notification shade without opening the app. This is available for all the third-party apps.        Likewise, the bundling of notifications has become easier as all notifications from one single app get bundled together. These apps can be expanded when needed by using the drop down expansion button or the two-finger gesture. Also, you can prioritize or disable apps notifications from the notification shade itself.  Source: Android Police  Split screen multitasking  It’s finally here! Google has finally introduced the split-screen multitasking into stock android. For those of you who don’t know, what you can do with this function is that you can use two apps at once and can run/use two apps at the same time, side by side. Phones like Samsung and LG have had this function for quite some time now and Google has finally decided to add this feature now. Although\xa0it can only be used in few apps at present, developers will certainly come up with this feature in the near future.   Instant app opening  This is one of the best features about android 7.0. You can open any app by opening its link. Go to Google.com, search something, open the link, and you’ll get the app version of the site. No downloads needed and no need to buy it. It is truly a game changer. But since 7.0 just came out, it’ll take some time for developers to make use of this feature in their apps.   Virtual reality  Google is planning big in the Virtual Reality world with Android 7.0 Nougat. The project, known as Daydream, is a platform where third-party manufacturers build a VR headset while Google works in the software department. Google has not explained how it expects its hardware partners in the project are going to work but as we all know, Daydream will need specific requirements like special screen and sensors.   New added emojis  Not a major feature, but it is still fun. Google has added 72 new emojis to thousands of current emojis. Texting has never been this easy.   Quick Switch between apps  This feature can really come in handy when you’re multitasking. You can now switch between the app that you used recently by tapping the overview button twice.   Doze feature to save battery  Google had added the doze feature in Android 6.0 Marshmallow for battery’s longevity. In Nougat, it has significantly improved this feature. In Marshmallow, whenever a phone is kept on a flat surface, the phone would automatically go into doze mode to save battery life. In Nougat, doze mode can now work even when you have your phone in your pocket, i.e. when you’re on the move. The phone gets into doze mode when you lock your phone.

['Everything You Need To Know About Rooting an Android Device'],"['Tech Guides', 'How to', 'Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['August 26, 2016']",2016-08-26 12:34:41+00:00,"['Hello our dearest technology lovers, we are so happy to tell you that from today we are introducing a separate column “HOW TO.” In this column, we typically shade some light on the how to get maximum from your gadget. So today we are starting with rooting an Android device.  First thing first you should be familiar with the various terms before actually rooting your Android device. In simple language rooting an Android device overcome the limitations of the hardware which in result allow us to alter the system apps and setting. Rooting\xa0is the process of allowing users of mobiles,\xa0 tablets \xa0and other similar devices running the\xa0Android\xa0mobile  operating system \xa0to attain\xa0 privileged control \xa0(known as\xa0 root access ) over various Android subsystems. We all know Android uses Linux Kernel, rooting allows us to give administrative privileges (superuser) like in Linux or Unix Systems like free BSD.  We will tell you how to root your android device but before that let’s dig the meaning of most used terms-         ROM:  A ROM is a modified version of Android. It may contain extra features, a different look, speed enhancements, better performance, or even a version of Android that hasn’t been released for your phone yet.  Stock:  From context to context, “Stock” may mean different.\xa0 We mean the Google-built version if we say “Stock Android” which we find on Nexus devices, with no extra UI changes as in HTC (i.e. HTCSense) or Samsung (i.e TouchWiz). Many ROMs found these days are based on stock Android with additions like CyanogenMod, while some others are based on the version that came with your device when you bought it. In some cases, “Stock” can also mean the original version of Android that came at time when you bought your phone-e.g., if you want to return back to your factory setting and get rid of your ROM you might say you’re “going back to stock.”  Kernel:  A kernel is the component of your operating system that makes communication between your software and hardware and it actually plays a role of a mediator. We can find a lot of custom kernels out there for most phones, and you check out one for your device, many of which can and increase performance, speed up your phone and increase your battery life among other things. We have to be very careful with kernels because sometimes it can cause serious problems and sometimes it can even brick your device.  Flash:  Flashing means installing something in a device which may be ROM, or Kernel or even a recovery that comes in the form of a ZIP file format.  Brick:  There is always a risk (sometimes it may be small sometimes you just don’t know) with flashing and device gets stuck unable to function that is, it means you have bricked your device. And this problem even can be solved or is fixable.  Bootloader:  The lowest level of software on a phone, running all the code that’s necessary to start your operating system is the bootloader. Most bootloaders come locked, meaning you can’t flash custom recoveries or ROMs.  Recovery : The recovery is the software on a phone that is used to make backups, and perform other system-level tasks. The default recovery on your phone is limited and can’t do much, but you can flash a custom recovery available-like ClockworkMod or TWRP, which is pretty much done after you’ve unlocked your bootloader that will exceed the limits and give you more control over your device. This is often an integral part of the rooting process.   Hope you all are familiar with some common but most used terms and now we actually move onto the process of rooting. Everybody need to do a few things to prepare phone/device for rooting, depending on which method to use. Many of the ways require you to install the Android SDK or unlock your bootloader and the methods varies according to the models of Android devices. This sounds like a lot of scary work (if you want more information on this, please do write us) so we here discuss some of the commercial apps available to root your Android devices.  Using the commercial Root Apps:  Kingo Root:  Using commercial rooting apps like Kingo Root is straightforward, and can be done with or without a computer. But the sad this is that this app can’t root every phone.   Kingo Root can be installed in computer and if you’re using a computer with Kingo Root, you’ll need to have the USB drivers installed on the computer. If you don’t have them don’t worry, the Kingo Root will try to locate and install. Then plug your phone into the computer and start the application and click the button saying “root” in the software. As long as your phone is supported, the rest is automatic. As soon as the process completes, you’ll have super user unlocked. You can even root by installing the Kingo Root on your device and following the instructions and “VOILA” and now you are the superuser.  Towelroot:  It is an app developed by famous iPhone hacker Geohot. Using it is easy, the first download this application, install the app and run it by tapping the Lambda symbol in the middle of the app window. What it does is it will try to exploit the running kernel, giving temporary access to the system files of the device. Then correct files are automatically installed then the device will reboot, and you’re rooted.   This is the screenshot of the rooted android mobile.  \xa0  [socialpoll id=”2383627″ path=”/polls/2383627″] There are many other similar root apps like Farmaroot which is one click root. Now you are wondering what to do, for it you have to check our website for the next article where we are going to write about “Must Have Apps for Rooted Android Devices” and don’t worry Apple fans we are also covering topic on “ Jailbreaking  iOS devices” very soon.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rooting-customroms.jpg']

Xiaomi phones are quite popular in Nepal, and the  Redmi Note 3  is one of the best selling smartphones\xa0in Nepal as well as all over the world. Earlier today, Xiaomi has unveiled the new iteration of the beloved Note series, the Redmi Note 4 which sports premium design, upgraded hardware and most importantly, an affordable price tag.

Lately, the app numbers have increased rapidly giving us choices in each and every category. There are thousands of useful apps in Google Play Store. In this article, I have made a list of six apps that people in Nepal are mostly unaware about but might find really useful. These apps provide tons of facilities and a worthwhile android experience. Prev Next 6.  AmpMe        Ever regretted not bringing a speaker when going out with your friends? AmpMe is a perfect solution to this problem. What it basically does is connect a number of devices so that you can play something from your music library, Youtube or even SoundCloud, all at the same time on multiple speakers. Create a ‘party’, connect your phones to it, and then you’re good to go. This might sound gimmicky, but if you’re out somewhere with no speaker, this app can come in handy. The only downside of this app is that you’ll need to connect to a wireless network to use it. And yes, it works on iOS devices too. 5.  Evernote        Evernote has been one of the best note makings and notes managing apps around for a while. Its simplistic design and vast functions are useful in every means. You can make a simple text note or a handwritten note, take pictures and even make notes by including attachments. Evernote even allows you to share your notes. There’s even a chat function when you’re co-writing something with your friends. Seriously, making notes has never been this easy. 4.  Gravity Gestures        Everyone likes the chop-chop gesture in a Moto phone or the double tap to wake in OnePlus phone. But most of the phones people use still lack those features. The app Gravity Gesture is a perfect fit in these devices. You can use four kinds of gestures to open an app, to make a call, to control the volume or to toggle torch. There are various other functions you can do just by rotating your phone in different directions or by shaking it, giving you more control over what the gestures do. 3.  IFTTT        IF is an app like Tasker. It lets you automate various functions just like tasker. This app was previously known as IFTTT (If this then that) which basically tells us all about the app. In this app, you create recipes where you’re basically filling in the blanks in the statement ‘If ___ then ___’ where you can add thousands of conditions. One example is, ‘If any new photo, post a tweet with the image’. What this function does then tweets the new image you have just taken. I use it for notification purpose on various stuffs I need to know. You can even make the light in your house flicker if something happens (such as when your favorite team scores a goal). 2.  Pocket        You come across an article about your favorite football club or a blog by a famous person just when you were about to do something important. There might not always be time to read those articles. Pocket helps you in this situation by saving links for offline reading. Just drop the link you want to read later in the app and you’re good. It is similar to saving pages on browsers, but this app does a much better job. 1.  Zedge        Wondering around the internet looking for the perfect wallpaper for your phone? Zedge is the perfect solution to your problem. Consisting of tens of thousands of amazing wallpapers, the contents of the wallpaper vary from anime, designs, and logos, to nature and sports. In an instant, you can find wallpapers related to almost every field. [Awesome Batman wallpapers btw!] You can also change your icon packs, download ringtones and notification sounds from this app.  So this list basically consisted of some apps I think we Nepalis don’t usually install on our android smartphones. Do you know any apps like these? Don’t forget to comment.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/apps.png']

['Apple’s September 2016 Event: What to Expect?'],"['Apple', 'iOS']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['August 25, 2016']",2016-08-25 03:36:50+00:00,"['Alright everyone tighten\xa0your seatbelt as we are a few weeks away from Apple’s Special Event. We all know Apple typically introduces iPhone in September. Apple is widely expected to debut the iPhone 7 (name may vary) at the upcoming September Special Event to be held on 30 th  Sept. as revealed by Barbara Streisand after she had spoken to Apple CEO, Tim Cook. The murmurs and rumors of new iPhone had already started even before the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) held on June 13, 2016. Today we will go through the expectations and sum up all those rumors and information about what Apple might announce during its keynote.  Great Confusion- When’s an event?  According to Bloomberg, Apple will reportedly unveil its next iPhone on 7 th  September but Barbra Streisand (a famous actress who recently called Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook complaining about the pronunciation made by Siri), said Event will be held on 30 th  September. The well-known phone-leaker Evan Blass also supported Bloomberg. And we also think 7 th \xa0Sept. would be the right date if we go through those past events. If Apple does have an event that day, it’ll also be the final day of IFA 2016 in Berlin and all people will have their attention only for Apple Special Event, but it’ll have to compete with\xa0Sony’s PlayStation event, where we expect to hear more about the upgraded PlayStation 4 console and the rumors says it’s going to support 4K games (this will be the entire next article).         APPLE’S SEPTEMBER 2016 EVENT: WHAT TO EXPECT  iPhone 7/ iPhone 7Plus/ iPhone 7 Pro:  In September 2015, Apple introduced two models of iPhone ( iPhone 6S and 6S Plus ) followed by a smaller model,  iPhone SE  in March 2016. And September has always been a great month for Apple and its fans, it is more likely that Apple will reveal a new model of iPhone (probably they are going to name it iPhone 7) and every year the design is speculated by the fans and the Apple users. Talking about the specifications/features, we just don’t know yet but we in this section deals with all the rumors going around the world. The coming iPhone 7 is going to drop the headphone jack and also include a new home button with haptic feedback, and it will look a lot like the 6S. For a completely redesigned iPhone, we have to wait for some months. There has also been the talk of an iPhone 7 Pro which is thought to have better photo-taking capabilities – like a dual-camera setup.  In Weibo (Chinese Microblogging Website which is used by 30% of internet users and it is hybrid of Facebook and Twitter), the following photo (down below) is gaining popularity. MacRumors reported that the antenna bands across the rear will apparently\xa0be moved to the top, while the camera lens will sit flush rather than protrude as it does currently. Now we don’t know much about every specification. We will update about everything in the next article.   iOS 10  iOS 10 was unveiled at WWDC earlier this year and since then it has released several beta builds (Oh my god beta 10 is already out) to both developers and the public, giving us a good idea of what to\xa0expect from the final software. We all are waiting for the final release of it and of course what could be a better time than the September Event. So be in position for the final update which we all have been waiting since June. The new iOS will support a number of new features designed to enhance an iPhone even more beyond what the company launched in iOS 9 last year. The biggest update as claimed by Apple, there will be at least 10 major features, including a HomeKit Home app as well as changes to Siri (Siri is expected to have major change), the lock screen, and photos. We will update our readers about the every feature on next article.   iPad Pro  Last year, Apple combined what would normally be two events into one giant event. At the event, it announced the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus alongside 12.9-inch iPad Pro on one day and a 9.7-inch version was unveiled months later. Apple may again do that same thing, no one but they know it.   However, according to noted analyst\xa0Ming- Chi Kuo, Apple will refresh its iPad lineup in 2017, with three new iPads which may range from 9.7 inches to 12.9 inches. According to him, Apple plans to introduce a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model next year which go along with a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 as well as low-cost 9.7-inch iPad model. Apple will keep its September event focused only on iPhone if Kuo is right and more than this even we could not say. But of course, don’t forget we are here to update you if any leaks happen.  MacBook Pro  We all are a bit disappointed at WWDC earlier this year as we didn’t see any update in MacBook Pro beside MacOS. At WWDC 2016, everyone thought Apple was going to update its MacBook Pro line but Apple did not give any sign of it that time. Now the world is expecting refreshed models to come out this autumn instead. We know there are two sizes of MacBook Pro: a 13-inch model that was last updated in March 2015, and updated in May 2015 was a 15-inch model. So, nobody can imagine Apple is going two full years without rolling out MacBook Pro models. Also, the Apple fans have not imagined it and they are really taking this to heart.   Rumors suggest that the new ones are on the way and are ready to burst and capture the market. What’s more, the upcoming laptops won’t have faster processors and even they won’t have thinner bodies, which we all pretty much expect. They are heavily tipped to feature an OLED touch panel and a Touch ID sensor in their keyboards which may be embedded.  However,\xa0 Bloomberg \xa0reported in earlier this month that the new computer will be a no-show at Apple’s upcoming September Event. So sad Apple fans but don’t worry as the event is approaching near and till then what can we do besides hoping, waiting and watching. And don’t forget we are here to update on each and every leaks, murmurs, rumors, and information.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mac-event.jpg']
['Galaxy J2 2016 Review: Is it Worth it?'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['August 24, 2016']",2016-08-24 09:04:21+00:00,"['Samsung’s latest midrange phone, the Galaxy J2 2016, is here. If offers substantial improvements over its predecessor, but with the increasing competition from Chinese and Indian manufacturers in a midrange price segment, can the Galaxy J2 2016 Edition live up to its hype? Let’s find out in our review:  Disclaimer: We tested a retail version of the Samsung J2 2016 provided by Samsung Mobiles Nepal for the purpose of this review. We used it for about 2 weeks before gathering our impressions, and then we sent it back.  Design:        The design of the Galaxy J2 is nothing to write home about. It features the same all plastic design and looks similar to other midrange handsets from Samsung. Although made up of plastic, it’s ergonomic and feels sturdier in the hands.   It’s light weight and one hand operation is very easy thanks to its compact form factor. What I also like about Samsung Phones is the inclusion of a decent Home button that serves you well while using the phone. Double tap it and the camera app opens which is one of the quickest ways to take photos. The back and multitasking capacitive buttons are also very responsive, but unlike seen on the high-end phones, these are not backlit.   Display:  Samsung has been a pioneer in the display department. They make the best smartphone displays. The Galaxy J2 sports a 5-inch HD display with AMOLED panel. At this price, this is the best display we have ever tested. The IPS panel of other handsets is a no match in front of the vibrant, oversaturated 720P display of J2. The sunlight legibility and viewing angles are also stellar for the price. Samsung has not included any kind of protection, so make sure you insert a tempered glass that will prevent the phone from scratches and drops.   Software:   The J2 2016 runs on the latest Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with touch wiz UI layered on top. What we have learned from Samsung in the last couple of year is they have worked really hard in improving the UI by excluding a lot of bloatware and make the UI clean and minimal.        1  of 5                                                                    Performance:  The J2 2016 boasts a 1.5Ghz quad-core cortex A7 processor (Spreadtrum SC8830) with 1.5GB of RAM. It\xa0features a\xa0Turbo Speed Technology (TST) which the company claims will result in superior device performance. On our test, the 32 bit Cortex A7 Processor performed fairly well while doing normal tasks like chatting, browsing, and navigating through UI. However, the outdated 32-bit Speadtrum processor means you sacrifice while playing games, opening apps, and multitasking. Although low-end to mid-end games are playable, but you will see lags and drop frame rates most of the time. That being said, it’s a budget phone so we can’t expect more from the device. In terms of memory, the Galaxy J2 has 8GB of inbuilt storage (3.6 GB available to users). Since most of the storage is being used by the OS, you will soon run out of storage  Camera:\xa0  The 8MP rear camera of the J2 2016 is pretty average. It can capture “Okay” photos during daylight with vibrant colors, but the details is not there once you zoom in the photos. The low light imaging, as well as indoor imaging, is below par with lots of noise. The 5MP front camera is decent for taking selfies and for social media uploads.   Connectivity & Sensors:\xa0  The Galaxy J2 2016 comes with 2 SIM slot with 4G LTE. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi b/g/n (no dual band ac), Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS. It includes a\xa0Smart Glow LED’s on the back which is a nice feature, but not practical and gimmicky at best. Samsung Galaxy J2 also lacks few basic sensors like ambient light sensor, gyro sensor, and a secondary noise-canceling microphone.  Battery:\xa0  The Galaxy J2 2016 offers a sizeable 2600mAh battery which is user replaceable. On our battery test, it provided 3.5 to 4.5 hours of on screen time, which means it should last you a whole working day. It lacks quick charge technology which means it will take roughly around 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.   While most of the phones don’t have access to the battery, the J2 2016 offers a removable battery. So, if you are a power hungry user, you could easily get an extra battery for around Rs. 1500 and enjoy the benefits.  Conclusion:  The competition of midrange smartphone is getting fierce as there are lots of  smartphones under Rs. 20,000  to choose from. The Galaxy J2 2016 offers great AMOLED display, ergonomic design, and a good selfie camera. But, the phone lags behind the competitors in other aspects like the performance, rear camera, and sensors. \xa0If you are don’t play high-end games, use a smartphone mostly for chatting and browsing, like to take a lot of selfies, value brand, after sales service and availability of accessories, and need a removable battery, the Galaxy J2 2016 would be an excellent choice.      Pros  Cons    – Excellent\xa0Super AMOLED display  (bright, vibrant 720P display)  – Sluggish Gaming Performance\xa0  (Spreadtrum 32bit chipset is not favorable for gaming and heavy multitasking)    – Feature pack UI\xa0  (S bike mode,\xa0Ultra data saving mode, Smart Glow App)  – Low internal storage\xa0  (Out of 8GB onboard storage, 3.6GB is only available to the user)    – Battery Life (4 \xa0hours of onscreen time)  – Average Camera\xa0  (The camera lack in details and can only record videos in 720P)']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/samsung-j2-2016.jpg']

The grey variant will be deprived of Samsung warranty,\xa0and is priced exorbitantly at Rs. 1,35,000. The phone is currently available from  M.K.Tradeline.   Until and unless you absolutely can’t wait for the official launch of Note 7 (scheduled for Sept.) or you have an extra cash lying around, I personally, don’t recommend you to get the Note 7 from the grey market. It would be wise to wait for few weeks and get it from the official Samsung store. Moreover, history suggests that Samsung Mobiles Nepal will be coming up with pre-order schemes like free Gear fit or Gear VR, so you don’t want to miss out on such freebies.         The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is already available in 10 countries that include US, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, UAE, and Korea. It is scheduled to launch in Europe on Sept 2. Coming back to the phone’s spec, it shares a lot of similarities with the Galaxy S7 edge, but also a few of its own tricks — including new S Pen features, fresh software and an iris scanner.  The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 features a 5.7-inch Quad HD\xa0Super AMOLED curved dual edge display with Corning\xa0Gorilla Glass 5 protection. It has a metal frame and a glass back reminiscent of the S7 Edge. The Note 7 is also IP68 water resistant; the first Note series to have it. Powering the device is an Octa-Core Exynos\xa08890 processor with 4GB RAM which is exactly the same configuration as the Galaxy S7, so we can expect excellent performance.  In terms of storage, the Note 7 comes in just one storage variant with 64GB of memory that is expandable via microSD card slot upto 256GB. As far as the camera is concerned, the Note 7 features exactly the same camera as the Galaxy S7 Edge. It has a 12MP rear camera with LED Flash,\xa0dual-pixel\xa0PDAF,\xa0Smart OIS, and f/1.7 aperture. The front houses a\xa05MP front-facing camera with f/1.7 aperture.  What’s new about the Note 7 is the inclusion of Iris Scanner, along with Fingerprint scanner on the home button. The Iris scanner lets you unlock the phone using eye recognition. The S-pen has also been improved with a\xa0smaller tip and improved pressure sensitivity. The Galaxy Note 7 is rocking Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and should receive the Android 7 Nougat sometime in the future.   The Galaxy Note 7 also boasts a USB type C port which charges the 3500mAh non-removable battery. Overall, the Note 7 is much similar to the S7 Edge in terms of performance, display, camera, and build which is not a bad thing by any means. If you are using the S7 Edge or the Galaxy Note 5, the Note 7 might feel boring and less innovative. However, if you are using older generation Samsung phones or other Android handsets, the Note 7 might be an excellent upgrade.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/note-7-1.jpg']

"['Tech Talk with a candidate of Nepal Engineers’ Association election, Er.Bidhan Pokhrel']",[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['August 18, 2016']",2016-08-18 16:04:12+00:00,"['Social Media, these days, are filled with advertisement banners of engineers and their respective groups, giving a hint of elections coming around. Nepal Engineers’ Association is on the process to elect its 31 st  executive body and five members of Nepal Engineering Council on September 16 th , 2016. Nepal Engineers’ Association (NEA) is basically an independent non-profit organization of Nepalese engineers, registered under the Social Service Act of the Government of Nepal. It was established in 1962. Today, it represents around 20,000 engineers, belonging to various engineering disciplines including architects, civil, electrical, mechanical, and electronic which is governed by an elected executive body of 15 members, led by the President of the association for a tenure of two years. NEA’s mandates include promoting fellowship goodwill and cooperation assistance among the Nepalese engineers, safeguarding their rights and interests and promoting the development of science and technology.  NEA facilitates and coordinates the professional activities of the independent engineering specific professional societies and has also been at the forefront of developing fellowship and goodwill with international engineering associations and institutions. Presently, NEA is a member of World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO) and was instrumental in the establishment of Federation of Engineering Institute of South and Central Asia (FEISCA).  Yesterday, we got an opportunity to spend some quality time with  Bidhan Pokhrel  who also have filed a candidacy for the post of an executive member in the upcoming election of NEA. We asked Bidhan Pokhrel some of the questions regarding the election and his candidacy.        On with the interview…  1. So, let’s start with a very simple question. Tell us about yourself.\xa0  I am Bidhan Pokhrel, an Electrical and Electronics Engineer graduate from Kathmandu Universty. Professionally I am working as an Electrical Engineer in Nepal Electricity Authority, Community Rural Electrification Department for the past two years and have designed, planned and executed several electrification projects in rural communities. Besides I am a Non-life Insurance Surveyor as I have played a decent role in loss evaluation of damaged properties and settling Insurance claims efficiently after the massive earthquake.  2. What made you file a candidacy for the executive member of NEA election?\xa0  I, as a professional engineer, just feel that there is a lack of protective, accountable, controlling body here in our country. Even though Nepal Engineers Association (NEA) exists but it has a very limited reach and us common engineers rarely get access to any activities within the organization. Hence, in this scenario, I have filed up a candidacy as to provide a notable contribution in the betterment of we engineers and make NEA a common ground for the upliftment of professional engineers.  3. So, how are you going to overcome such limitations?\xa0  I along with my team here in the election have a strong agenda of Digitalization of all sector and works carried out by NEA, reducing the paperwork and promoting IT infrastructure. Online Membership Management, E-Voting portal management system, Online weekly and monthly seminars would certainly be the first set of works I would initiate if been elected. In this situation when IT is backing up all the activities and movements of the world, we believe that we ourselves being a technical force would not be suitable no to rely on IT for the management and operation of NEA.   We as a team have a lot of agendas to be carried out, as actions speak greater than words, it would certainly be better if we come up as we have done this rather that we will do this. But as a major change we would certainly coordinate with different sectors to establish a Research Unit/Consulting Unit as try to produce as much capable consultants here in Nepal itself and next speak up officially from the organizational level for the insensible and unrealistic thoughts preached publicly related to any sector of engineering with calculated and specific data’s.  4. How are you conducting your election campaign?  As we have focussed on Digitalization of the organization I personally and as a team also we have focussed on digital media for the promotion and campaigning. I have tried to speak personally will all my engineer friends, seniors, and juniors to support in my election campaign. Next us as a team, in the leadership of Dr. Sumitra Amatya, as president candidate has planned to visit all the election centers all over Nepal and conduct a mass campaign.  5. Finally, any words you would like to share with our readers?  I present myself as a youth representative in this election who could justify engineering from an early professional level and would certainly work forward for the innovative management and utmost mobilization of engineers here in Nepal if elected.   I request all my engineer friends, seniors, juniors, and well-wishers to cast your precious vote for the post of the executive member and the team lead by Dr.Sumitra Amatya as president. We would not let your vote be wasted and would certainly work in the progress of Engineering Sector and the organization NEA itself as a young, energetic, enthusiastic and Innovative team. It would definitely be easier for me to fulfill my commitment with team work as we are a team of progressive and professional engineers working for a better tomorrow.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tech-talk-with-bidhan-pokharel-scaled.jpg']

['Samsung Galaxy S7 review After 6 months: Still Going Strong'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['August 16, 2016']",2016-08-16 06:29:17+00:00,"['Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge when released earlier this year, changed the landscape of mobile devices. Smartphone lovers all over the world went haywire with what the S7 had to offer. It had the best display, latest SoC, and bigger battery. However, the most impressive part was its 12MP camera with f/1.7 aperture which outperformed the top-dog camera phone, the iPhone 6s. But that was 6months ago, and in between, we witnessed releases of many great smartphones. So how does the Galaxy S7 hold up to its competitors even after 6 months? Let’s find out:  Design:  For me, Galaxy S7 has the most comfortable form factor, being only 5.2-inches, I could easily maneuver it around my hand, and the curved glass on the back nicely aids to the single handed usage. The glass and metal body felt quite good on the hand, giving premium feel wherever you touch. I think the S7’s design is still relevant to this day, as the latest Galaxy Note 7 has inherited some of the design aspects from S7.         Display:  Samsung\xa0has the vogue to put the best display on its every flagship phone, and the S7 is no exception. The Super AMOLED display on the S7 is one of the brightest and sharpest display compared to any flagship phones today. It is a complete joy to use this display, I often found most of the displays on smartphones\xa0dull having used the S7. Even if you’re not a fan of bright, sharp colors, you can tweak the color balance of the display to make it feel cool and natural. Other great addition to the display, is the Always ON Display which at first seemed gimmicky, but worked out quite well and I got used to it. If you want to check, time or date, you don’t have to bother opening the lock to view it, that information\xa0are just there whenever you want it. But I wished the customization options were more extensive.   Performance:  Galaxy S7 that’s available in Nepal comes with Samsung’s in-house chipset Exynos 8890. Although most of the flagships today carry the Snapdragon 820 Chipset , the Exynos 8890 is equally powerful and even power efficient\xa0shows some of the tests. Even the latest Note 7 sports the same SoC. To this date, I hardly had any glitch, everything runs smoothly. It has been handling everything I throw at it quite well. It can still handle new high-end graphic intensive games and phone does heats up to some extent but its nothing too serious. But I have to admit it’s not that optimized when it comes to handling multitasking. Although it sports 4GB of RAM, it holds comparatively few apps in the memory compared to other phones.   Camera:  The 12MP camera with f/1.7 aperture was a revolutionary step towards mobile photography. It had the best camera compared to any smartphones 6months earlier, and even till this date, it is the most qualified camera compared to any other smartphone. The more you use the camera, the more you’ll love it. The joy of mobile photography is immense with this one, you don’t even have to think twice before shooting, everything comes out fine even if you just point and shoot. The images that it results are crisp and highly detailed. You get different camera modes to get creative with and a manual mode with which you can get the desired shots. S7 can shoot videos upto 4K and like the photos, it does a pretty great job on creating high-quality videos. The video output is so impressive that \xa0we even used it to shoot some of the footages in our reviews. For the camera, it doesn’t get any better than the S7, it is still\xa0unarguably the best camera on a smartphone. Check out the sample images  here .  Software:  Hate it or Love it, the Galaxy S7 is rocking the TouchWiz UI on top of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. TouchWiz UI has become way less cluttered and is light now. The software seems pretty clean and smooth, I didn’t found any bug during my usage. The phone also has been getting regular updates, making the device more secure and smooth. \xa0It has become more customizable in terms of appearance now that we have the theme store. You can put on any look you want for your phone.   Battery:  Talking about the battery life, the 3,000mAh battery gives pretty decent screen on time of about 4hours. The standby time is great even with the Always ON Display. Having used the OnePlus Three, the S7’s quick charge seemed rather slow, but nonetheless, it charges up completely within 1.5 to 2hours.   Water Resistance:  For me, it has been one of the most logical features on the S7. I have been caught off guard by rain couple of times this monsoon and I’ve had zero worries thinking my phone will get water damaged. It withstood pretty well against the rain and has been working strong without any issues.   Verdict:  S7 for me has clearly been the most beloved phone this year and is still going pretty well. \xa0I hardly had any issues with the device mostly related to software. One thing most of my friends pointed out: although glass construction on a phone feels classy and premium, they’re really fragile, if you fail to take good care of your phone, it is going to be costly so make sure you have a pretty good tempered glass and back cover on your phone. That’ll hide the beauty of the phone but at least it’ll be safe. S7 is a complete package however you want to \xa0look at it, either if you’re looking for the best display, best camera, high performance or any other kinds of stuff, S7 has got it all. Although it’s been 6 months since the release of S7, I think it is still the best phone you can buy today and most of the high-end phones released during the period of 6 months still don’t come equivalent to what S7 has to offer.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/samsung-galaxy-s7-4.jpg']

The phone is priced at Rs. 23,500 and comes in grey, silver, and gold color options.  The Huawei GR5 Mini features a 5.2-inch 1080P display opposed to the 5.5-inch display of the GR5. It is powered by a more capable Octacore Kirin 650 SoC that comes with 4 cortex A53 cores clocked at 2Ghz and remaining 4 cortex A53 clocked at 1.7Ghz. The Kirin 650 SoC is better than the Snapdragon 615 that was used in its predecessor Huawei GR5. The kirin 650 SoC sports an intelligent i5 coprocessor that the company claims will\xa0provide hardware support for tasks like speech recognition, low-power consumption MP3, sensor hub, fused location provider (FLP) navigation, and more efficient location-based tasks.         In terms of memory, the GR5 mini features the same specs as the GR5. It has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage with dedicated microSD card slot upgradeable upto 128GB. On the back, the phone houses a\xa013MP autofocus BSI camera with single LED flash, and a fingerprint scanner V2.0 which the company claims will unlock the phone in 0.5 seconds. The fingerprint scanner\xa0can also be used to answer a\xa0phone call, click photos, or shut down alarm.  Up front, the Huawei GR5 Mini has an 8MP snapper which could potentially be selfie lovers’ dream. But, we will hold our judgement until we review the product. Powering the device is a rather sizeable Li-Po 3,000mAh battery which looks decently sized for a 5.2-inch display and energy efficient Kirin 650 SoC. The phone is currently running on Android Marshmallow 6.0 with Emotion UI 4.1 layered on top.

Let’s find out if the phone is worth all your money.  Design:\xa0(Rating: 4.5/5)  The Gionee F103 Pro is easily one of the best-looking phones you can buy below Rs. 20,000. It sports a metallic frame with a removable plastic back. It’s light at 142gms and maintains reasonable thickness at 8.5mm. The design is ergonomic and feels comfortable in the hand — thanks to its compact form factor, slightly curved body and a 2.5D curved screen upfront.              1  of 4                                                          Display: (Rating: 4/5)  The Gionee F103 Pro comes with a 5-inch IPS display with HD resolution delivering a pixel density of 294ppi. You will easily get 1080P displays at this price range, but the display panel that Gionee has put in this phone is a quality unit. The touch is responsive, the contrast and viewing angles are also decent, and most importantly offers accurate color reproduction. The brightness, however, is dim with average sunlight legibility.   Software: (Rating: 4.5/5)  While most of the midrange phones are still on Lollipop 5.1, the F103 Pro is running the latest Android OS in Marshmallow 6.0 which brings features such as battery saving doze mode, app permission, etc. Like other Gionee phones, the F103 Pro also features Amigo UI 3.2 layered on top of Android. There are a lot of features packed into Amigo UI; most of them are useful while some of them being gimmicky than anything else.  Like other Chinese phones, the Gionee F103 Pro also lacks app drawer so all your apps reside in the home screen. You also need to swipe from the bottom to get to the quick access panel. You can check out the UI screenshots here:      Gionee F103 Pro Software UI   1  of 6                                                                              Performance:\xa0(Rating: 4/5)  The Gionee F103 Pro is one of the few phones under Rs.20, 000 to feature a whopping 3GB of RAM. Coupled with 1.3 GHz 64 bit quad-core MT6735 processor, the performance is smooth while browsing, chatting, opening apps, and multitasking. You can play high-end games on medium to low settings with ease, but the phone tends to heat up after longer playtime. The low to mid-end games, on the contract, runs smoothly without any hiccups. Overall, the phone performs fairly well for the price.   Camera:\xa0(Rating: 3.5/5)  The phone sports a 13MP rear camera with LED flash which is average in my opinion. It takes above average photos during daylight with sufficient detail while zooming, but it might not be enough for others. The noise level increases during low light condition as expected in this price range. On the software side, the camera offers HDR, face beauty, panorama, macro, and even a professional mode is baked into it with which you can change the aperture, ISO, and shutter speed to your liking.   The Front Facing camera is the highlight of the Gionee F103 Pro as the 5MP shooter is capable of taking excellent selfies for social media uploads and video chatting.  Connectivity:\xa0(Rating: 3.5/5)  The F103 Pro supports two SIM card with first SIM supporting 4G LTE (GSM) and the second SIM supporting 3G (GSM/CDMA). Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi (no dual band ac), Bluetooth, and GPS.\xa0The only missing link as far as connectivity is concerned is the lack of fingerprint scanner.   Battery:\xa0(Rating: 3/5)  The phone boasts a 2400mAh battery and combining it with energy efficient 64-bit processor and lower resolution 5-inch display, the battery life is still average. During my test, the phone lasted for a whole working day (10am to 5pm) before requiring a charge in the evening. It has 3 hours of onscreen time which is average and the phone also takes 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100 % since the phone lacks quick charge technology. But, if you are a power hungry user, you can get an extra battery pack since the phone features a user replaceable battery.   Conclusion:   Flagships are the best, but not everyone has the budget to get one and certainly not everyone needs flagship grade performance and camera. At a fraction of the price, you can have the Gionee F103 Pro and you will not miss out on too much. It ticks many boxes when it comes to built quality, display, performance, camera, and overall value for money.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gionee-f103-pro-1.jpg']

Luckily, you don’t have to spend a fortune to do so. We’ve listed 3 different ways on how you can refresh your laptop:  1. Clean Laptop Fan and Apply Thermal Paste on CPU and GPU  The primary reason why your laptop is slowing is because of overheating. Overheating occurs because of dirt and dust inside your laptop fan and also due to drying out of thermal paste. Cleaning the laptop fan and applying thermal paste on CPU and GPU will\xa0maximize heat transfer making the laptop cool even during gaming.         If you are not so sure to open the laptop casing and cleaning the laptop, you can go to a laptop repair shop. They usually charge you around NRs. 1,000.  2. Installing Utility Softwares:  Installing utility software like Ccleaner,\xa0Revo Uninstaller, and, Defraggler can improve the overall health of your laptop. All of these apps are free, and will get the job done. The  Ccleaner  will clear the junk like redundant programs and temporary files from your hard drive or SSD. The  Revo Uninstaller \xa0uses advanced scanning algorithms to find out the remaining files in the drive and remaining data in the registry and deletes remnants of already uninstalled programs.

Although it’s a year old phone, but what it has to offer for the price is still relevant compared to phones of today. It is priced competitively at  Rs.15,990.   On a first sight, ZTE Blade S6 looks like an iPhone 6 clone, which follows a lot of Apple’s design language. The phone sports a 5-inch 720p display with a pixel density of 294ppi with no protection mentioned. It has last year’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Chipset (64 bit Cortex A53 Octacore), Adreno 405 GPU along with 2GB of RAM which is a great offering for the price. You can easily handle your day to day task, play high-end games at low-to-mid settings and multitask between few apps. Backing up this device is a decent 2400mAh battery, which, by the looks of the specs should give you an easy one day of backup. Like most of the Chinese Smartphone Manufacturer, ZTE also has its own UI called the\xa0 MiFavor 3.0 on top of Android 5.0.1 Lollipop with no sign of any future updates as it’s already been a year since this phone was out.

The Galaxy Note 7 shares a lot of similarities with the Galaxy S7 edge, but also a few of its own tricks — including new S Pen features, fresh software and an iris scanner.  The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 features a 5.7-inch Quad HD\xa0Super AMOLED curved dual edge display with Corning\xa0Gorilla Glass 5 protection. It has a metal frame and a glass back reminiscent of the S7 Edge. The Note 7 is also IP68 water resistant; the first Note series to have it. Powering the device is an Octa-Core Exynos\xa08890 processor with 4GB RAM which is exactly the same configuration as the Galaxy S7, so we can expect excellent performance.         In terms of storage, the Note 7 comes in just one storage variant with 64GB of memory that is expandable via microSD card slot upto 256GB. As far as the camera is concerned, the Note 7 features exactly the same camera as the Galaxy S7 Edge. It has a 12MP rear camera with LED Flash,\xa0dual-pixel\xa0PDAF,\xa0Smart OIS, and f/1.7 aperture. The front houses a\xa05MP front-facing camera with f/1.7 aperture.  What’s new about the Note 7 is the inclusion of Iris Scanner, along with Fingerprint scanner on the home button. The Iris scanner lets you unlock the phone using eye recognition. The S-pen has also been improved with a\xa0smaller tip and improved pressure sensitivity. The Galaxy Note 7 is rocking Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and should receive the Android 7 Nougat sometime in the future.   The Galaxy Note 7 also boasts a USB type C port which charges the 3500mAh non-removable battery. Overall, the Note 7 is much similar to the S7 Edge in terms of performance, display, camera, and build which is not a bad thing by any means. If you are using the S7 Edge or the Galaxy Note 5, the Note 7 might feel boring and less innovative. However, if you are using older generation Samsung phones or other Android handsets, the Note 7 might be an excellent upgrade. The phone will be priced somewhere around $850 and will come in Blue Coral, Gold Platinum, Silver Titanium and Black Onyx.

Ltd., the official distributor of Xiaomi phones in Nepal, has launched the Xiaomi Mi Max for Rs. 35,000 (3GB RAM variant). You can pre-book the phone right now and get Rs. 2000 discount from  this link .  [Update: The Xiaomi Mi Max is now available in Nepal for Rs. 32,000] Mi Max is the largest phone from Xiaomi and is also one of the biggest size phablets you can buy right now with a massive 6.44-inch display. So with the increasing size of mobile displays, we have to stand back and ask ‘How big is too big?’ We already have tablets starting from 7-inches in size and \xa0now there only remains a thin line between\xa0what we generally consider as tablets and phablets.  Mi Max  despite its massive size is a beautifully crafted device with an unibody metal construction with a curved back. The front houses the mammoth 6.44-inch full HD display with 342ppi and is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The huge display is certainly a plus point for watching movies, playing games or reading books, but when you have to place a call, you’ll look ridiculous holding a massive phone on your head. The phone is running on MIUI 7 on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Mi Max has two variants: one with 32GB storage, 3GB of RAM and Snapdragon 650 chipset and another with the 128GB storage, 4GB RAM, and Snapdragon 652 chipset. The one that’s being launched in Nepal is the 3GB RAM variant and if it succeeds to entertain the market we will probably see the higher variant as well. Both the variants come with expandable storage up to 256GB via SIM 1 hybrid slot.         Talking about the camera, Mi Max sports a 16MP Rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and PDAF. The rear camera can shoot videos in 4K resolution at 30fps. The front houses a 5MP camera with f/2.0 aperture. Typical of Xiaomi, you get a fingerprint sensor on the back as well. And powering this colossal device is the 4850mAh non-removable battery.  But what about the pricing?  Vatsal Impex has yet again launched a\xa0new Xiaomi product, the Mi Max, at a sky-high price of NRP. 35,000. The phone was launched in India couple of weeks ago for INR. 15,000 (NRP. 24,000). So, we are paying exactly Rs. 11,000 more for basically the same device. No matter how you look at it, you cannot justify the pricing of the phone.  Yes, the device has got some serious specs underneath, but that’s what Chinese brand Xiaomi is all about. They are well known for providing a\xa0powerful phone for affordable pricing. But, at NRP. 35,000, the Xiaomi Mi Max is no more an affordable offering.

['Guide for buying a second hand smartphone'],"['Guides', 'Buy Guides']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['July 28, 2016']",2016-07-28 08:36:55+00:00,"['If you’re willing to buy a high-end device but your budget just ain’t right, then you probably could go for the second-hand smartphones. There is a high chance that every time you buy a second-hand product, you get fooled in one way or another. Here is a brief guide for those who want to buy a second-hand phone without making a fool of themselves.  1.  Physical Inspection:  First things first, when you buy a second-hand product, you have to closely observe the hardware of the phone see if there are any external damages like scratches, cracks, tempered body and bruised edges. Check the edges thoroughly to see if the phone has undergone multiple drops.         2.  Battery and Port Inspection:  Take off the back cover if it’s removable and check the battery and other parts that are there. The battery will have a white square/rectangular sticker on one of its edges, all you need to do is just check that the color of the sticker hasn’t turned red or pink.\xa0Test the ports for charging, USB, SD card, Headphone jack and Sim Card to see if they work correctly. Look for discoloration as these ports are usually of metal and discoloration means water damage. Type\xa0*#*#4636#*#*\xa0on the phone’s dialer then select “Battery Information”. In there, you’ll have an overview of the unit’s battery and other useful information about it.   3.\xa0 Display Test:  The most important part of your phone is its screen, you have to thoroughly check if the screen is responsive and clear and any other cracks and smudges are easily recognizable.\xa0 \xa0Apart from the physical inspection, to check other aspects of\xa0 display such as dead pixel and multi-touch, there is secret service code for most of the devices, for android devices try *#*#2663#*#*\xa0or\xa0*#*#2664#*#*. For Samsung phones, try: *#0*#   4. Connectivity Test:  It is a hard thing when it comes to checking the connectivity of the phone.\xa0 But there is secret service code for these things too, to make the job easier.   i.\xa0 Wireless LAN or Wi-Fi test:  *#*#232339#*#* OR\xa0 *#*#526#*#* OR\xa0 *#*#528#*#*  Try to connect to Wi-Fi hotspot if applicable.  ii.   Bluetooth Test:  *#*#232331#*#* Try to transfer a file over Bluetooth.  iii. \xa0 GPS Test:  *#*#1575#*#* OR\xa0 *#*#1472365#*#*  Also bring a data-enabled SIM card to test mobile data of the handset and also don’t hesitate to place a call from that phone to test the smartphone’s ability to pick-up a signal and check the microphone and earpiece of the device.  5.  Camera Test:  For camera test, try to check if there are any dirt or scratches on the lens. Also take some pictures and videos to ensure you’re satisfied with the cameras performance. \xa0Dial *#*#34971539#*#*\xa0on the phone’s dialer to see the camera information.   6.   Check for the warranty claim:  Checking the warranty is the easiest thing you can do to test the device. This will show how many times the phone has been repaired or has faced issues. Also, if there is warranty left on the device, Kudos for that! Also, ask for the Box which proves that the phone belongs to the seller.  7.  Check if the device is rooted or Jailbroken:  Always buy a phone in its original state, never go for rooted and jailbroken phone unless you really want to. There are many issues and bugs on the phones that are rooted or jailbroken. Also, it voids the warranty if there is any. Know more about rooting  here in this link.   8.  Getting at the right price:  You will have to check a couple of online stores and local shops to get an idea of the minimum price that you will have to pay to buy a second-hand device. This price may differ depending on the condition of the phone, warranty and guarantee if any, accessories bundled and so on. \xa0You may have to pay a little extra if the device is bundled with accessories or comes with a warranty.   Here are a couple of questions you should ask the seller before buying their product:  -What is your Reason/s For Selling? -When and where did you purchase this smartphone? (Ask for a receipt if possible) -Have you encountered any issues with the device? -Did this unit undergo repair in the past? (If yes, ask the seller what was repaired) -Have you dropped the phone in the past?  Wrap Up:  Lesser the time period for which the phone is used, better its condition but this may not be applicable in all the situations.\xa0Also, we highly suggest that you research about the model of the device that you’ll be purchasing and take note of the IMEI/Serial numbers of the devices that were known/reported to be inferior to other models. Also, make sure the phone is not stolen cause you could be getting into some legal issues. And you can always buy second-hand products from trusted online sellers like the “ iCandy .”']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/429747_4381275_717638_image-11.jpg']

Both the devices look surprisingly good in terms of looks and specs and are cheap as one would expect from Xiaomi. Redmi Pro lies in the budget lineup, but by the looks and pumped up specs, it seems rather like a top tier mid-range device which shows the standard where today’s budget phones stand. On the other hand, the Mi Notebook looks stunningly similar to the Mac Book Air which is not necessarily a bad thing.  Redmi\xa0Pro:  Redmi Pro features a unibody metal construct with a 5.5-inch Full HD OLED panel with 2.5D glass. This is the first phone from Xiaomi to include an OLED panel and it doesn’t stop there, it even features a dual camera setup for an immersive bokeh mode. With the dual camera setup, the usual fingerprint sensor on the back has shifted to the front home button. Talking about the camera, it features a 13MP camera and a second 5MP Camera to capture the depth information to give immersive bokeh effect which was also present on the recently launched Huawei P9.         There are three variants of the Redmi\xa0Pro based on their storage, 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB. Both the 32GB and 64GB version comes with 3GB of RAM but the 128GB comes with 4GB of RAM. The 32GB variant sports Helio X20 SoC while the 64GB and 128GB version comes with the more powerful Helio X25. Both the Helio X20 and X25 are deca-core processor offering great performance.

The device was  launched back in\xa0April \xa0in different color variants and storage options, however, only the gold variant has been launched in Nepal with 32GB ROM and 3GB of RAM.  The Huawei P9 Nepal launch event was eccentric in many aspects. Rather than going for a mundane venue, the folks at Huawei\xa0 espouse\xa0 the ground floor of City Centre, Kamalpokhari. The event\xa0saw many celebrities like Namo Buddha, Sugam Pokharel, and Cartoon crewz\xa0entertaining us with their awesome performance. The event was open to all the wanderers of the city centre and it was soon filled with the crowd. Overall, it was a great experience.\xa0         Talking about the phone itself, the main highlight about the Huawei P9 is its dual camera sensor. Both the camera has a 12MP sensor. The first camera has an RGB sensor and the second camera has a monochrome sensor which only takes black and white photos. Both the camera simultaneously takes the photo and combines them to produce a greater quality image. The monochrome sensor allows the camera to capture just the light, not the color, so it has higher details and sharpness, while the RGB sensor takes the photo in color which filters the lights coming to its sensor resulting in loss of details so when both the photos are combined a better quality image is obtained. This is noticeable particularly in bright highlights and dark shadows where details are easily missed by single/small sensors.   Also, the dual camera sensor on the Huawei P9 allows us to select multiple focus points which give a greater depth of field with closer shots. But the P9 doesn’t come\xa0with Optical Image Stabilization. All and all the camera on P9 is supposed to be crazy fast and take high-quality photos and seems like the dual camera will be a thing in all smartphones in coming years but as of now only the P9 and LG G5 have a dual camera.

You will get plenty of Bluetooth speakers in the market ranging from Rs. 2000 to high end ridiculously priced speakers from KEF, Boss, and JBL. In such market, it’s a dilemma for users to choose a decent Bluetooth speakers that will fit your budget. Today, Allocacoc has launched a portable Bluetooth speaker, the Audiocube, that is priced at  Rs. 7900  which we believe is an excellent budget offering from the company.  As the name suggest, the Audiocube is cubical in shape and although it’s not quite as portable as one would expect, but it feels well-made and has some heft to it, weighing around 1330gms. It is made up of hard polycarbonate giving the device a premium look and feel. In terms of connectivity, we get Bluetooth 4.0 for wirelessly streaming full bandwidth CD-like quality music. For non-wireless devices, we have a 3.5mm aux input. For controls, you get all the basic buttons like pause/play and volume buttons.         The sound coming out from the drivers are spectacular with large volume for such a portable device. Moreover, the Audiocube uses four omnidirectional speakers providing a surround sound experience. The sound is clean, with good detail in the treble. However, what I really liked about the Audiocube is its Bass; its top notch for the price you are paying. Having said that, the sound does have its limitations as you will notice some distortion at higher volumes. The Audiocube takes 4 hours to charge from 0 to 100%, and will provide 12 hours of music playback time.   If you are an audiophile with a budget of around Rs. 8000, you won’t regret buying the Allocacoc Audiocube. There are plenty of affordable Bluetooth speakers out there in the market, but quality wise the Audiocube is soundstage. There are also plenty of high-end speakers, but they all are priced ridiculously high. For a fraction of the price, you can get the Audiocube and you won’t miss out on too much.

['Huawei G Play Mini: Is it still worth it? (After 1 Year)'],['Huawei'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['July 5, 2016']",2016-07-05 10:29:57+00:00,"['It’s been a while that Huawei G Play Mini has been launched in the Nepali market. The phone received good feedbacks from the customer back then, and now it’s available for Rs.17,000  (Update:  It’s  available right now for Rs. 15,000) . But the question is: Is the Huawei G Play Mini still worth the money even after a year? So, let’s find out if the phone is worth the price.  Key Specs:   5 inch (720 X 1280 pixels) IPS display  1.2 GHz Octa-core 64 bit processor  2 GB of RAM  8 GB of onboard storage expandable upto 32 GB with a MicroSD card  Mali-450Mp4 GPU  13 MP f/2.0 Aperture autofocus back camera with LED-Flas  5 MP front  facing camera  2550 mAh Li-Ion non-removable battery  WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth 4.0, Radio, WiFi Direct  Accelerometer, Proximity sensor, Ambient light sensor, Digital compass  Huawei EMUI 3.1 above Android 5.1( Lollipop) upgradeable to EMUI 4.0 above Android 6.0 (Marshmallow)   DESIGN  Design wise, the GPlay Mini is a premium looking phone even after being made with plastic. The front part of the phone looks like its elder brother the P8 Lite except for the navigation buttons on the G Play Mini is capacitive. The phone is slightly on the heavier side having a weight of 162g. The phone doesn’t feel cheap in any manner.         DISPLAY  The Huawei G play Mini features a 5-inch (1280 x 720) pixel display with 294ppi (320dpi). High-definition displays are common these days in a mid-range segment, but what really matters is the quality of the screen, brightness, color reproduction and touch sensitivity.\\   As far as Huawei G play mini is concerned, the quality of the screen is really good with decent viewing angles thanks to the IPS technology. The display panel manages to produce vibrant and accurate colors, but there are two minor glitches that I saw in the display. First of all, the screen is not bright enough. Secondly, it is deprived of any kind of glass protection.  SOFTWARE UI  It’s running EMUI (EmotionUI) 3.1 on the top of Android 5.1 Lollipop in the newer lot and still has EMUI 3.0 with Android 4.4 Kitkat in the older lot which has not still received an update. If you haven’t use a Huawei phone before, you feel like using a separate OS as it lacks an app drawer like other Chinese smartphones on the market. Unexpectedly the G Play Mini has received Android v 6.0(Marshmallow). The update has brought a new set of features like:   EMUI (Emotion UI) 4.0  Unwanted Message cancellation within 4 seconds  New digital Compass  More optimization  Power management  New gesture control   PERFORMANCE  The Huawei G play mini is equipped with Huawei’s in-house Kirin 620 chipset with an Octa core 1.2Ghz Cortex A53 64 bit processor supplemented by 2GB of DDR3 RAM.  The Kirin 620 Chipset is somewhat similar to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 615 chipset seen on Panasonic Eluga Mark, Obi SF1 and Xiaomi Mi4i. Under normal usage like browsing, chatting,etc., the phone is deprived\xa0of any lags. The phone runs smoothly while multi-tasking or switching between apps.   I installed some heavy games like FIFA16, MC5, etc and it runs smoothly without any lags. It tends to heat after continuous usage, but that won’t bother you too much. Even flagship phones like Samsung Galaxy S7 and One Plus 3 heats up while playing that kind of graphics demanding games.  Overall, the performance of the G play mini is its biggest asset. If you want a phone with the best performance in this price range, G play mini would be a worthy choice.   CAMERA  The Huawei G play mini is capable of capturing some nice shots as it’s been equipped with a 13MP rear facing camera – and decent feature for such a low-cost device. Up front, a 5MP camera can capture excellent selfies.   The \xa0 13 MP back camera can capture good photos during\xa0daylight. Macro shots are amazing with lots of details, vividness, and accurate color reproduction. Low or artificial light shot\xa0is not impressive but doesn’t\xa0disappoint\xa0at all. Check out the photos sample here:  LINK \xa0  BATTERY  The non-removable 2550 mAh battery on the Huawei G play mini is more than enough for one day of moderate usage. You can watch Youtube Videos continuously for 4 hrs. Upon continuous browsing and chatting, it should give you 5 hrs of backup.  Huawei Gplay mini  CONNECTIVITY   The phone supports Dual GSM 3G SIM (HSPA). Other connectivity\xa0includes WiFi 802.11b/g/n, WiFi Direct support, WiFi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.0, and GPS/GLONASS. However, the phone doesn’t support USB OTG\xa0and neither has 4G LTE bands.  CONCLUSION  Overall, the GPlay Mini is a decent phone with good build quality, performance, and an average battery. However, it would have been better if the phone offered larger onboard storage in 16GB, and had Gorilla Glass protection, but we can’t expect too much from a budget smartphone priced at just Rs.16, 999. For that price, it’s still a steal particularly considering the price drop.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/huawei-gplay-mini.jpg']

Unfortunately, most of us don’t have the time to invest in thoroughly exploring all the options. As a result, we often wind up making a hasty, less than ideal choice.\xa0Everywhere you look Internet service providers are touting with their marketing schemes, and it’s easy to get confused by the various choices on offer.  All of us are looking for the fastest internet option at a budget-friendly price, and we often overlook the features such as after-service support, installation fees, and reliability. If you are fed up with your current internet service provider, then now might be the best time to change it to Vianet as the company is offering  15Mbps internet speed for just Rs. 1800 . That being said, you get 200GB of monthly volume package with a downfall speed of 640kbps after volume completion.  This is a perfect deal\xa0even for heavy torrent downloaders out there as 200GB of monthly data should be more than enough. 200GB of data means you get to spend around 7GB on a daily basis which is ample in our opinion. Even if your data runs out, you will be greeted with 640kbps speed for the remaining days. If you want to save some bucks on installation and ONU device, we suggest you get the yearly plan since this scheme is deprived of installation fees and you get 50% off on ONU device.        The recent package upgrade offers 2.5 times more data and 3 times faster internet with the same price as before.  Talking about the competition, Worldlink is also providing  15Mbps internet speed for Rs. 1600 , but you get less data at 150GB and fall back speed of 512kbps. Also, Vianet’s overall service makes\xa0it a clear winner. Moreover, the existing users who were paying Rs. 1800 per month will automatically be upgraded to this plan.

['Colors Pride P80 Review: Decent Smartphone on a Budget'],"['Colors', 'Reviews']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['July 1, 2016']",2016-07-01 11:39:57+00:00,"['In a market full of mid-range phones, the low-end segment seems to be forgotten as we don’t see many phones at this price category these days. Colors Pride Series has always been targeted for those who are not familiar with android or touch-screen phones. Colors is now back again with the latest iteration in the Pride series, the  Colors Pride P80  which we got to play around for few weeks and here is what we think about the device.  Design:  Design wise, the Pride P80 looks pretty cool with its two-tone shading, white on the back and black on the front panel. The phone is quite comfortable to hold with the curved edges which is a nice addition on\xa0a budget category. The build is pretty solid and sturdy with some little weight to it. The phone weighs around 155grams which is justifiable as it sports a 3200mAh battery.         Display:  Pride P80 sports a 5-inch 720p display which is pretty decent for its price. The phone doesn’t seem to have any kind of protection up front; it’s recommended you put on a screen protector that’s available on the box. The 5-inch display has a\xa0good color accuracy and you won’t feel like you’re looking at a sub 10k device when you look at the display. While watching movies and playing games, we didn’t miss out on much details. The viewing angles could have been better, but there are not much color shift. Also, the display is pretty decent when it comes to outdoor visibility.   Hardware and Performance:  Talking about the hardware specifications, Pride P80 sports a MediaTek 1.3GHz quad-core chipset with Mali MALI-400-MP2 GPU along with 1GB of RAM which is a pretty decent performer. The problem with this phone is with the software optimization. The UI feels pretty laggy at times, and it’s just a mess sometimes when you get into the multitasking tab. But the lag is not there once you open an app and continue to use it. It should be some issue with optimization which can be fixed with an OTA update.You can also get away with some of the lag using a third party launcher other than that you won’t have any hard times with this phone.   Software:  The Colors Pride P80 is running on Android 5.1 Lollipop with a\xa0nearly stock-like UI. Like other Colors smartphones, you get Colors data saving app (Colors Lite), Miravision app for tweaking display’s tone, Colors App for service related inquiry, and theme store.      Software UI | Colors Pride P80   1  of 6                                                                              Camera:  Pride P80 sports an 8MP Rear Camera with CMOS sensor and LED flash. The rear is pretty usual of what you get in a sub 10k phone. The images come out decent from the surface, but once you zoom in there’s lack of sharpness and the colors usually look dull. Up front, the Colors Pride P80 houses a 5MP front camera which is also pretty decent. You can get some shareable photos for your social media if there’s plenty of light else you should not bother opening the front camera. You can’t complain much on\xa0the camera department as the phone costs little under 10k.   Battery:  Now, the\xa0battery is something that was highlighted as one of its biggest assets when it was launched. But in our experience, the massive 3200mAh battery didn’t last that long as we expected. We could only squeeze around 4 hours of Screen on time. Considering its low hardware specs and our minimal usage, its battery is just average. To charge this device, it takes more than 3 hours.   Connectivity:  Connectivity wise, the Colors Pride P80 supports Dual SIM: one micro and one normal. It also has a dedicated Micros SD card slot which supports storage upto 32GB in case the 16GB inbuilt storage (11GB user available) runs out. Also, it supports USB OTG which means you can connect a USB drive, HDD, keyboard, mouse and a lot of accessories in your phone which is really handy.  Verdict:  Overall, for the Price of Rs.9,995, the phone is well built and punches well above its weight. It has got a great display, great build, acceptable performance and an average battery life which all combined is a pretty good package for a phone at this price range. The only complaint for the device is its laggy UI which can bother you at times, if not, it’s a great buy for the price.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/colors-pride-p80.jpg']

So let’s find out if this phone is all metal and battery or something else in this review:  Design:  Design wise M5 lite sits flat without any curves and edges. It features an all metal back cover which is removable and has chrome accents along the edges. There’s nothing innovative about the design, but the phone looks justifiable for the price with a rectangular body and eye-catching colors. The phone is on the heavier side with the 4,000mAh battery on board, weighing around 183 grams but nonetheless, the phone feels sturdier on the hand and a little weighty on your pocket.         Display:  M5 Lite sports a 720p 5-inch panel which is not the sharpest but has pretty good color accuracy. The display is pretty much visible under the direct sunlight and the viewing angles are great. You also get Asahi Dragon Trail Glass protection which will prevent the display from minor bumps and scratches. A well-balanced display and 4000mah battery will help you get the most out of your smartphone when it comes to multimedia consumption.   Software UI:  Gionee M5 Lite has Amigo 3.1 UI on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop and won’t be getting any updates to Marshmallow. The phone’s UI is typical of what you get from most of the Chinese manufacturers; there is no app drawer and everything resides on the home screen in the form of folders or individual apps. If you have used phones without app drawers you’ll find yourself right at home, but if that’s not the case it’ll get some time getting used to. Amigo UI is a light interface which is very functional with the addition of smart gestures and touchless controls. Besides these, you get inbuilt power manager, theme store, network traffic monitor, fake call and many more.   Performance:  Performance is where the M5 Lite excels compared to other phones at the similar price tag. It sports a 1.3 GHz MediaTek MT6735 quad-core 64-bit processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. It can perform your day to day tasks like navigating around the UI, web browsing, video streaming, social media without breaking a sweat and you can do swift multitasking without missing a beat. For the gamers out there, it can run heavy games easily on medium to low settings. The device does gets heated up on gaming for a longer period of time, but it’s not so that the device is unusable. Overall, performance is one of its greatest assets.  Camera:  M5 Lite sports an 8MP rear-facing camera with autofocus, LED flash, and shoots videos up to 1080p. Talking about the image quality, it is average at best, even at daylight images lack plenty of details resulting in dull photos, and it gets even worse at low light with plenty of grain and dark spots all over the images. If you are a photography enthusiast, you are offered with a pro mode which can enhance the quality to some optimum level.\xa0 The 1080p video output, however, seems justifiable. It sports a 5MP front facing camera which is decent enough to click selfies and groupies for social media uploads.   Connectivity and Storage:  Connectivity wise it supports dual micro sim with 4G LTE / 3G HSPA+ and other connectivity features like WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, USB OTG.\xa0 If the onboard 32GB storage is not enough, M5 lite comes with a dedicated micro SD card slot which can be expandable upto 128GB.   Battery:  The battery is one of the major feature focus of the Marathon series.\xa0 The M5 Lite comes with a 4,000mAh battery which will last you upto 2 days on normal usage. If you’re a heavy user you can squeeze around 6 to 7 hours of screen on time with the given power saving modes and tools. In my test, I got around 11 hours of screen on time with back to back video playback. On the downside, it takes more than 3 hours to completely charge your device with the provided stock charger.   Verdict:  The saturated midrange market will overwhelm you with how much it has to offer and you have many choices which are more or less the same. But Gionee M5 Lite stands out in the crowd with premium metal design, great performance, quality DTS audio output (via headphones) and a long lasting heavy duty battery. If you’re one of those people that are concerned about the performance and the battery, this phone will not let you down.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gionee-m5-lite.jpg']

SelfieBot is a personal robot which anybody can assemble it using inexpensive electronics, software, and firmware of Endurance. \xa0The big fact is that you can really use it as a practical phone holder for video broadcast or video recording. The device ability to turn after you is also a big plus.   To assemble it, you need a 3D printer, a WanHao Duplicator i3 which is suitable for PLA printing. You also need to be willing to see into the robot schematics to be able to assemble the circuit board. You can, of course, assemble everything on a breadboard, but it’s better to do it on a circuit board as it is more reliable.\xa0So, let’s download a  ready-made Bb8 model for printing \xa0and\xa03D print it. We’ll need about 500 gms of PLA.         You can order all the necessary electronics on eBay or Aliexpress. You can also buy it in any radio and electronics store. There’s also an option to buy an Endurance ready-made kit of electronics for $95. \xa0It will save you time and nerves. Then, you can carefully assemble the circuit board as it is described on Endurance website. And finally, you can upload the firmware.\xa0To control a Bb8, you’ll also require an Android smartphone with 4.1 or higher version.   You can download the SeflieBot Droid app from the Playstore and install it on the phone. After that, pair the phone via Bluetooth with that of Bb8 electronics.   Make sure you check the mechanical part of the device and see if the servos rotate and everything works. Since, we have 3D printed the Bb8 body neglecting the inner fixing system which is a con, but not a big deal. To make ready the inner fixing system, you can use a plastic or acrylic basis. It is necessary to speed up the servos in such a way that they could rotate in two planes and one servo-supports the other. For this, you need to make the coupling gear drawing. The given construction is not technically perfect, but it works.  \xa0  \xa0        1  of 3                                                After assembling everything together, connect the 12V power. Start the app on the phone, and here we are – the demo mode operating, to check if everything works. The robot starts turning its head.

['How to Make diode\xa0laser etching of a PCB (DIY Projects)'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['June 23, 2016']",2016-06-23 09:40:37+00:00,"['3D-printers have opened endless possibilities for home production and rapid prototyping. Now you can easily create practically any model in a 3D-program and 3D print it. But until now, only a\xa0few people have thought about the possibility to 3D print electronics for this or that solution (model). Up to this day to make a circuit board for a prototype one had to pore over it with a soldering iron or to order a short production run. However, many of us can make it using a conventional iron and a laser printer.   Though, this process is not very pleasing either aesthetically or technologically. In this article, we would like to describe another method. Not only any 3D printer but also any DIY Engraver will fit for it.         You can install a diode laser almost on any 3D-printer, setting it as an addition or in place of the extruder. Diode lasers are small in size and compact. Their relatively small power output compared with that of CO2 lasers is not a drawback in this case.   So, what does the process of the circuit board manufacturing at home or in the office look like?  For this, we need a copperized glass fiber plate, any dark vinyl film (any dark film that a laser can burn through will fit), iron chloride (sold openly in stores of chemical reagents) and, of course, a diode laser installed on a 3D printer. Its power output is not so very important, but we recommend to use a diode laser of more than 2W (2000 mW).\xa0To install a laser on any 3D printer is very easy. Here are some few steps:    Create a circuit board model using any program of an InkScape type (inversion picture. Later, we’ll explain why inversion).    Convert it into the  gcode    Stick the vinyl film onto the copperized plate of glass fiber.\xa0        1  of 2                                        Place the vinyl-coated glass fiber plate onto the work table of the 3D printer, and turn on the 3D printer in the laser cutting / engraving mode.\xa0     \xa0The laser will burn on the vinyl film an inversion image of the pattern to  be resulted.\xa0        1  of 3                                                  Dissolve the iron chloride powder in water (do not worry, no chemical reaction will follow)\xa0     Put the glass fiber plate into the iron chloride water for 45-60 minutes.       The copper on the glass fiber surface, free of the film after the laser burning, will react with the iron chloride (copper etching chemical reaction) and goes into the solution leaving clean glass fiber in the contours of the inversion image. Then, make holes for the necessary connectors with a small drill, or leave as is, and solder the connectors on top of the circuit board. So, we have told you how you can create a small shop – laboratory for circuit boards manufacturing, using a 3D printer and a laser. This technology is certainly not perfect and has several shortcomings, but it is efficient and can be used at home and small laboratories.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wsi-imageoptim-diode-laser-etching-of-a-PCB.jpg']

['Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro Review: Budget friendly meets the premium'],"['Reviews', 'Xiaomi']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['June 19, 2016']",2016-06-19 06:52:59+00:00,"['Since its establishment, Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi has taken budget phones to a whole new level. Following the footsteps of its predecessor Redmi 1 and Redmi 2, the recently launched Redmi 3 pro brings upgraded features like the fingerprint sensor, huge 4100mah battery and an impressive metal body for an asking price of Rs. 23,500. But Specs are not everything, so let’s find out in our review if this phone is worth all your money?  Design  The Redmi 3 Pro showcases full metal body, which gives it a premium finish. Even though the metal finish makes the phone slightly slippery, it can be used easily with one hand thanks to its compact form factor. The phone feels light in hand despite the huge battery inside it. The quick and responsive fingerprint scanner is on the back and is easily reachable by the index finger.         Display  The Redmi 3 pro features a 5-inch 720p IPS display, which is bright but nothing out of the ordinary about it. The display is very much visible under sunlight. Apart from the good viewing angles, it also features a read mode, which only makes the display a bit warmer and easy on the eyes.   Hardware and Performance  The Redmi 3 pro uses the 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 616 chip clocked at 1.5 GHz. With 3GB RAM onboard, the phone is quick, handles multitasking with ease and the gaming performance is surprisingly good. But, the phone gets warm while playing heavy games for more than 10mins, and then you will notice dropped frame rates and lags. If you are looking for a better performing phone at this price bracket, you could get the Redmi Note3.\xa0 Furthermore, it includes 32 GB of ample expandable storage via the microSD slot, but bear in mind that it’s not a dedicated slot but rather is a dual Hybrid slot.   Software  Redmi 3 Pro comes with Xiaomi’s own MIUI 7.2, which is built on top of Android 5.1. If you are not aware of MIUI, it is just like Apple’s iOS, doesn’t include an app drawer, i.e. all the installed apps sit on the home screen. MIUI offers lots of customization option that include a wide variety of themes, and other features like one handed mode. Though the UI is packed with features, it also includes bloatware that is pretty much redundant.      Software UI    1  of 5                                                                    Camera  The rear camera in Redmi 3 Pro is decent with 13 megapixels that include flashlight and autofocus. The images lack details while the color reproduction is average. The front camera is a 5 megapixels shooter and the images taken by the front camera is not that good but will be enough for social uploads. In addition, the camera clicks pictures really fast and the camera app includes tons of filters and features like HDR, panorama and face detection.      camera samples    1  of 5                                                                    Battery  The redmi 3 pro sports a huge 4,100 mAh non-removable battery with fast charging technology, undoubtedly one of the best features of the smartphone. The battery easily lasts a full day even with heavy usage and it takes just over three hours to fully charge the phone.   Connectivity  The redmi 3 pro has dual SIM slot (GSM+GSM/CDMA); one of which is a hybrid slot (the slot can be used as an SIM slot or a microSD slot). It features other connectivity options such as WIFI, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS. In addition, the redmi 3 pro has infrared blaster, which enables the phone to act as a remote for TVs and other devices.  Verdict:  Xiaomi has definitely upped their game in the midrange market with the introduction of their budget friendly Redmi 3 pro. The battery as well as the built quality and design is solid and Xiaomi has really set the standard for mid-range phones with the Redmi 3 Pro. However, the only place where the phone is lacking is in its ordinary display and its low-quality camera images. So, the phone is not recommended for people who like taking quality pictures with their phones. Having said that, Redmi 3 Pro will not disappoint in performance, and the built is very sturdy and good looking. With 64-bit Snapdragon chip, doing every function smoothly, the phone is a great offer for the market price when compared to other smartphones at the same price range.']",[]

On such a saturated market for texting apps, today Facebook has made a \xa0bold move launching the integration of text messaging feature baked into the Messenger app for Android.  Facebook is trying hard to make its users stick with the platform and has been heading towards supremacy when it comes to messaging. It’s not a bad thing that Facebook wants to be your everything as long as we get an outstanding platform for our daily needs. Not needing to have two apps for the sake of both texting(in general) is a relief for me. Facebook Messenger already provides many cool features like Uber, payment options, bots, mini games which have made Messenger one of the most versatile instant messaging app.         It is optional if you want to want to make Facebook Messenger as your default SMS app. Your instant messaging thread will be colored blue as default although Messenger has the option to change them and the SMS threads will be colored purple as default.  Besides this, you get the cool floating chat head feature for your SMS as well.\xa0 You won’t be able to use Messenger’s other features as of now but you’ll be able to send your favorite Facebook stickers. But in the future, it is certain that we’ll see bots and other features on the SMS front as well. \xa0Talking about privacy, Facebook has made sure that they won’t keep a record of the SMS and everything occurs locally on your phone.  From today, SMS feature has been available for various countries and until Friday, the update will be available worldwide. Standard SMS charges do apply here. Facebook is also trying to integrate this feature on iOS \xa0but it doesn’t allow permissions to access text messages.

Priced just at Rs. 7,495, it offers the latest operating system — Android Marshmallow 6.0 out of the box. This is one of the few phones in this price range to come equipped with Android Marshmallow.  Detailed Specification of Colors Pride P50  Colors Pride P50 sports a 5-inch display with a resolution of 854×480 pixels, which is not too many pixels in a 5-inch phone, but it is completely acceptable for its price tag. The phone is powered by a 1.3Ghz quad-core processor (MediaTek MT6580M) and Mali MP2 GPU. In terms of memory, it has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of onboard storage which can be further expanded via a dedicated microSD card slot up to 32GB.         Connectivity wise, the Pride P50 has dual SIM support with 3G support, WiFI, GPS, Bluetooth, FM radio, microUSB, and 3.5mm headphone jack. Just like the  Elite E15  and Pride P80, the Pride P50 also comes with a data saving feature called Colors Lite. With this feature turned on, the company claims that a user can save up to 50% of data. It has 5MP rear camera with LED flash, and a 2MP front camera.\xa0The Pride P50 has a 2200mAh battery.  Talking at the launch Event, the CEO of Teletalk Pvt. Ltd.

With the apt specifications that make life easier with best features, we have lots of hope with this new product in this line, with the sleek and stylish design like no other product in Nepalese Market ”  The main highlight of the phone is its running Android Marshmallow 6.0. While most of the phones are still running on Android Lollipop 5.1, to have the latest OS in the Pride P50 is a bonus. The Android marshmallow 6.0 brings plenty of features such as doze mode that increases the battery life of the phone.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/colors-pride-p50.png']

The Galaxy A5 is now priced at Rs. 41,900 (previously priced at Rs.48,490) and the Galaxy A7 is now available for Rs. 50,900 (previously priced at Rs. 55,490).  The Samsung Galaxy A5 and A7 offer excellent build quality thanks to a full metal body reminiscent of Apple iPhones. The Galaxy A5 has a 5.2-inch display and the Galaxy A7 with a bigger 5.7-inch display. Both these phones offer vivid AMOLED display with 1080P resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. Powering the phones is a 64bit cortex A53 octacore processor with a maximum frequency of 1.6Ghz. While the Galaxy A5 boasts a modest 2GB RAM and 16GB onboard storage, the Galaxy A7 comes equipped with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.         Camera wise, both the phone offers 13MP rear camera with f/1.9 aperture, OIS, and LED flash and the front houses a\xa05MP front facing camera with f/1.9 aperture. There is a fingerprint scanner that’s embedded in the home button. Both these phones run on Android 5.1.1 with TouchWiz UI layered on top.     Samsung Galaxy A5 2016  Samsung Galaxy A7 2016    5.2 inches (1080 x 1920 pixels) at 424ppi  5.7 inches (1080 x 1920 pixels) at 401ppi    Android 5.1.1 Lollipop  Android 5.1.1 Lollipop    Exynos 7580 Chipset (1.6Ghz Octacore Cortex A53)  Exynos 7580 Chipset (1.6Ghz Octacore Cortex A53)    2GB RAM, 16GB ROM  3GB RAM, 32GB ROM    13 MP Rear Camera with f/1.9 aperture, OIS  13 MP Rear Camera with f/1.9 aperture, OIS    5MP Front Facing Camera with f/1.9 aperture  5MP Front Facing Camera with f/1.9 aperture    2900mAh battery  3300mAh battery     Verdict:  The first and the very reason you’ll buy the A5 and A7 is for its look, build quality and the screen it offers and despite that, for a normal consumer there might be a lot of compromises with this phone; for example its price. Despite Samsung claiming that the Samsung Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7 2016 Launched in Nepal is a mid-range, the phone’s cost is above average to what we Nepalese customers are used to. But taking into consideration of all the specs, it might be feasible to have that price tag, but there are still other better options like the  Nexus 5X ,  OnePlus Two  and even the  Galaxy S5  for what it offers. Also as a phone that is released on 2016, both of these phones run on 5.1.1 lollipop, this is where people cringe over Samsung phones. Although Samsung has promised the Marshmallow update, it is a long way till we get it for this particular variant.   And if you’re wondering what else you could be missing on such an expensive phone, let me remind you there’s no LED notification. So, you never know if you have a new notification and you have to unlock your phone every time to check for notifications. Also, the phone is running on last year’s mid-range chipset Exynos 7580 which is only a very decent performer but results in a great battery life. Overall, if you want an average performing phone with a great AMOLED screen, flagship build and a sturdy design this might be the phone for you.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/A5-and-A7.png']

Just roll back few years, and we see budget phones featuring a plastic body, lower resolution screen, and sub-par performance. Priced just at Rs. 19,999, the recently launched Huawei GR3 brings metal body, but how well it fairs in other aspects? Let’s find out in this review.  Design   Huawei GR3 is arguably the best-looking phone you can buy right now under Rs. 20,000 in Nepal. It has a metal body on the back, however, the front is built from plastic materials. It’s light and feels sturdier in the hands. It’s a perfect phone for one hand usage too. Overall, I think the design of the GR3 is one of its biggest assets.         Display  The Huawei GR3 sports a 5-inch 720P display, which looks less compared to increasing trend of 1080P display in this price segment. However, you will be really surprised with the overall quality of GR3’s 720P panel. It produces excellent colors, is bright and vibrant too. The viewing angles are splendid and the display doesn’t disappoint under direct sunlight either. The only weakness of the GR3’s display is the lack of gorilla glass protection.   Software UI  Software wise, it’s typical of what you expect from Huawei phones. It’s running the EMUI 3.1 Lite layered over Android Lollipop 5.1. There are a lot of features packed into EMUI; most of them are useful while some of them being gimmicky than anything else. However, my biggest worry is if this model gets Android 6.0 or not.  Performance  The Huawei GR3 is powered by an octa-core MT6753T CPU with cores clocked at 1.5 GHz. The phone performs fairly well for the price. But, it does lag occasionally, and more frequently while loading heavy games and apps. The multitasking is also bit slower despite featuring 2GB of RAM. A lackluster performance of the GR3 could be a deal breaker if you are a heavy gamer or multitasking wizard. Having said that, it knocks up well in everyday tasks such as browsing, chatting, and playing light-end games.   Camera  The Huawei GR3 has a 13MP primary camera with single LED flash. Images have accurate colors, but there’s too much noise as you zoom in. The noise increases during low light condition. Dynamic range is mediocre, while the HDR mode doesn’t make a big difference. The video camera, on the contrary, performs fairly well. The 5MP front camera is also capable of taking good selfies and groupies thanks to its wide angle lens.   Connectivity & Storage   The Huawei GR3 has 16GB of onboard storage expandable by a microSD card up to 128GB. Connectivity wise, it has dual hybrid SIM slot with 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, and an FM radio.  Battery  Just like the camera, the battery life of the Huawei GR3 is also average. The 2200mAh battery will barely last for a day under heavy usage. With EMUI many Power saving mode, however, it might just last a whole working day before requiring a charge in the evening.   Conclusion  The Huawei GR3 is a good phone for those looking for an excellent build at an affordable price. However, you will get phones with higher resolution screens, better camera, and faster chipsets at this price point.  Review Overview:']",[]

['iPad Pro 9.7 Review: Best Tablet of 2016?'],"['Apple', 'Reviews']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['June 9, 2016']",2016-06-09 07:45:04+00:00,"['When Apple announced the smaller iPhone SE back in March, they also launched the smaller iPad pro with a 9.7-inch display.\xa0 Priced at Rs. 85,000 in Nepal, is this the best iPad ever? Or perhaps the best tablet to buy right now? Let’s find out in our review.   Just like the iPhone SE, what Apple did here is put the internals from the 12.9-inch iPad Pro into a 9.7-inch casing. However, Apple has added some improvements in this smaller variant making it one of the most powerful tablets ever, and unlike its bigger sibling, the 9.7-inch iPad pro is now easy to carry around wherever you like.         Talking about the display, Fantastic is the word to describe its IPS panel. Although the resolution remains the same as seen on the iPad Air 2, but the iPad pro is much brighter and less reflective. Moreover, it has a True Tone display, which houses new sensors that dynamically adjust the white balance of the display to match the light of your environment. It might look gimmickry on papers, but it’s a really useful thing to have on a bigger display. The Colors look more natural with the true tone display mode on. It’s currently running iOS 9.3, and we all know this version brings the Night Shift feature that uses the timeclock to change the color tone. Personally, I felt it’s a good thing to have if you’re an eBook reader.   The iPad pro now features 4 speakers and the sound is really good and is perfect for watching movies and listening to the song. As far as performance is concerned, it’s the best we’ve seen on a tablet. The Apple A9X 64bit chipset is indeed faster than the S7 Edge that we are currently using. Apps opening is blazingly fast, and the gaming performance is just breathtaking. You will barely notice any lags while playing heavy games, and with the wider surface area there are no heating issues.   While most of the tablet’s weakness is its mediocre camera, this one has the same 12MP camera of iPhone 6s. Yes, it’s very difficult to capture images while carrying this one, but the camera is just as good as 6s. This brings to the 5MP front camera which takes decent selfies and is useful while video calling. The battery on this tablet is excellent, and it takes around 3.5 hours to fully charge from 0 to 100%. Overall, the iPad pro is easily the best tablet you can buy right now. It sports everything you want in a tablet- Great screen, Fast performance, and excellent battery.']",[]

The companies are trying to deliver as much as they can. It looks like Samsung has taken this a bit seriously with its latest fitness tracker — Gear Fit 2.  Everyone thinks that smartwatches are not so impressive because of their premium price tag. But wait, I do not think you want to miss this one. Samsung has brought something impressive for gear lovers. Priced at $179, the new Samsung Gear Fit 2 can impress you in a lot of ways. The new Gear is the successor of the Samsung  Gear Fit  which was launched in 2014. Along with the normal features from the previous gear, Samsung has now added the GPS functionality and Heart-rate tracker\xa0to Gear Fit 2 and sports an attractive Display.  The Samsung Gear Fit2 comes in black, blue and pink colors.  Samsung has not only modified the exterior but also upgraded the interiors. The Gear fit 2 is compatible with all the android smartphones running the Android 4.4 (KitKat) or higher, unlike its predecessor which was limited to Samsung smartphones only. The 4GB of onboard storage for storing the music is a nice feature in the Gear fit 2.         Samsung has always been a leader in the display department. The 1.5-inch Super AMOLED screen gives a pretty vibrant display, which I can say is the best display in any fitness gear till now. The pixel density has bumped up to 322ppi. Clocked with 1.6GHz dual-core Exynos 3250, it runs on the company’s own OS, Tizen, which Samsung has included in its other smartwatches too. It boasts 512MB of RAM which is smooth enough to run the fitness apps and Samsung-made apps included in the gear. The integration of S Health app into the device has given a huge boost to deal with the fitness activity records.   The built-in GPS helps track your route and can automatically detect and record when you are running, cycling, walking — thanks to the help from accelerometer sensor. But you will have to let the device know if you are doing some complex activities like Yoga and Kapalbhati Pranayama :P. The screen provides real-time data while you carry on your daily exercise. The Gear Fit 2 can track your steps, distance travelled, sleep, calories burned and other common fitness stats. The barometer helps to detect the elevation.   You can also handle the notifications and get calendar alerts, calls, and texts, too. Although, you cannot use the voice technology to reply to your calls or texts but using emoji messages is fun to some extent. Another interesting feature is that you can directly stream from Spotify to a Bluetooth earbuds or headphones. But, this only works if your smartphone maintains a connection to your Gear Fit 2 since Spotify requires an internet connection.  Personally, the best thing about the Gear fit 2\xa0is it’s less bulky than most smartwatches out there and definitely less chunky than your average smart fitness watch. It’s even water resistant with an IP68 rating, though I am not quite sure if you can use it while swimming. The device supports wireless charging and comes with the magnetic charger out of the box.  Samsung Gear Fit 2 key specifications:\xa0   1.5-inch (216 x 432 pixels) Curved Super AMOLED display  1GHz dual-core processor  512 MB RAM,\xa04GB internal storage  IP68 certified (up to 30 minutes in up to 1.5m of water)  Bluetooth v4.2  Tizen OS (Compatible with phones running\xa0Android 4.4 or later with 1.5GB\xa0RAM or more)  Standalone music player  Sensors: Accelerometer, Gyro, Built-in GPS, Barometer,\xa0heart rate monitor  200mAh battery']",[]

With the inclusion of an inbuilt heartbeat sensor\xa0and ADI accelerometer with improved algorithms, this fitness tracker will certainly help track your fitness.        While the other fitness tracker running out of juice in a couple of days, Xiaomi Miband 2 lasts for 20 days thanks to its power-efficient OLED display and a large 70 mAh battery. With the second generation Bluetooth 4.0, the device can be paired with Android and iOS devices. If you work continuously during office hours, the Miband 2 monitors your activity and alerts you that you have been stationary for a longer period of time and suggest you go out and take some air.  It is available in black, blue, green and orange, and will go on sale on June 7th in China.

"['One Plus X Review: 4 Reasons to Buy, 3 Reasons Not to']","['OnePlus', 'Reviews']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['May 30, 2016']",2016-05-30 16:29:31+00:00,"['One Plus X has taken a more premium approach from outside but from inside, it is same as the One plus One. Now  available in Nepal for Rs. 28700 , One plus X provides us a stunning mid-ranger capable of delivering on both looks and performance. However, we’ll be discussing the 4 reasons why you should buy one plus x and 3 reasons why you shouldn’t in this article. So, Let’s get started with the pros first:   #1 DESIGN        The First reason to consider buying the OnePlus X is obviously the design. The device has a gorilla glass on the front and back with an anodized metal frame on the side that provides a nice feel to it. Because of its compact form factor, it is really easy for one hand usage. Overall, the One Plus X in terms of build quality and design aesthetics is a complete stunner.   #2 AMOLED Display  Reason number two to buy the One Plus X is the display. You have a 1080p display with AMOLED panel and you probably won’t see such a great AMOLED display on a phone at this price tag. Colors are vivid, sunlight legibility is top class and the viewing experience is great .The blacks are inky deep blacks, however, it’s not as bright when compared to flagships phones like Galaxy S7. Having an AMOLED display makes the One Plus X a battery efficient phone. The dark mode in the UI coupled with AMOLED display is a major battery saver.   #3 Software UI   And the third thing to buy the One Plus X is UI or the operating system of the phone itself. The phone is running on OnePlus’s own Oxygen OS which is pretty much stock like, but comes with a lot of tweaking functionality. You have features like off-screen gestures, the option to switch between onscreen and off-screen navigation buttons, tweak the quick settings panels, add color accent in system settings and control the app permissions.   You also have the quick alert slider on the left which makes toggling between different modes really quick and easy. The company One Plus is also known for providing regular android updates which we do not see on a lot on phones in this price category.  #4 Performance   The fourth thing why you should buy one plus x is its performance. Although it packs an older 32bit snapdragon 801 quad-core chipset, it is quite a capable processor. Coupled with Adreno 330 GPU and 3GB of RAM, the performance is a complete beast. You can watch Full HD videos, play high-end games without any lags or stutter, and the multitasking is fluid and snappy.   OnePlus X is not a flagship handset, for that, we know we have the OnePlus 2. It comes with some compromise which you should be aware of before buying it.  #1 Average Camera  The first reason why you shouldn’t buy the one plus x is because of its average camera performance. Although the 13MP camera looks good on paper, but in real life usage, it’s pretty average compared to other phones at a similar price.\xa0 On daylight, the camera performs pretty well and captures images pretty fast but on a medium and low light, the Captured images generally look a little hazy and lack fine detail. Video quality is fairly good, although the camera’s microphone is a little underpowered, so sound quality isn’t stellar.   The 8-megapixel front camera, on the other hand, is more than capable of shooting decent selfies with images turning out to be bright and clean.  #2 Battery   The second reason not to buy the OnePlus X is its average battery life. It has a 2525mAh battery and coupled with an older 32bit processor it yields in an average result. Also, the phone lacks quick charge feature meaning it will take more than 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.   #3 Heating issue   The third and final reason why you shouldn’t buy the OnePlus X is its heating issue. While playing games or using it for a longer period of time, the phone tends to heat up.\xa0 Although, there is no heating experience while normal usage.']",[]

['How to Register IMEI Number of your smartphone in Nepal'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['May 25, 2016']",2016-05-25 14:25:37+00:00,"['It has been some time now since Nepal Telecommunication Authority (NTA) made IMEI registration mandatory in Nepal. However, except for the official importers, not many have registered their smartphones’ IMEI until now. In a bid to increase that number, NTA has started online IMEI registration which is certain to make things easier for the users.  NTA had made IMEI registration compulsory in April 2016. It had even said that the phones with unregistered IMEI numbers would become dysfunctional from April 1, 2017. However, citing various reasons, the government-owned telecommunication company chose not to take the action.         Since NTA made IMEI registration mandatory, over 17 million IMEI numbers have been registered in NTA’s books. The company claims that since the start of the campaign, the number of illegal import of smartphones has decreased significantly over the years. And to be even more effective, NTA is finally set to implement its rule of making unregistered devices dysfunctional. According to Min Prasad Aryal, Managing Director for NTA, the company will appoint a third-party team to make unregistered mobile phones inoperable soon.  How to Register IMEI Number of your Mobile Phone?  For the registration purpose, NTA has already  come up with a site  where users can easily register their mobile phone’s IMEI number. The site is, however, still in a demo phase. NTA, in full coordination with the Government, Customs Office, and Nepal Telecom, has promised that IMEI registration will go online at the start of the next fiscal year.  The registration of your smartphone’s IMEI number not only will help you  track your lost phone  or during the emergency case, but it also helps the government to stabilize the illegal supply of grey products in Nepal.  IMEI Registration from phone bought from Abroad  One of the most asked questions regarding IMEI registration is whether an individual can register a smartphone they were gifted from someone abroad or not. NTA has no issue whatsoever with anyone using a mobile phone purchased abroad as long as it’s registered.  If individual users have bought a phone from abroad, you don’t need to get worried. Just follow the IMEI registration process mentioned above, and you are good to go. This also works for people who have bought the phones from unauthorized distributors. This registration process doesn’t hamper individuals who buy the handset from abroad or from local retail shops. It’s basically to diminish the unauthorized supply of smartphones in Nepal.  Objectives of the IMEI Registration in Nepal   Meet the requirements of national and consumer security.  Identify the genuine mobile handsets and make the fake and non-genuine handsets inoperable in Nepal.  Enable tracking/blocking of a mobile handset that is lost/stolen.  Encourage to import and sell genuine mobile handsets.  Minimize the possible grey market and encourage mobile handsets import through the Customs Office(s).   Advantages of online IMEI registration in Nepal:   Mobile importers can now register the numbers online whereas previously they had to burn CDs and manually submit the IMEI to NTA.  Mobile importers will not have to go up against illegally sold mobile phones now as NTA will be keeping track of all devices.  User can now easily register their mobile phones online by creating an account on a web-based NTA application.  If a handset of a user is stolen, it will be easy to keep track via its registered IMEI.  Nowadays, lots of people use their mobile phones for banking and financial purpose. The registered IMEI will now make the transactions more secure.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/6zEBKp1464186323.jpg']
['Lithium-air batteries could power next-generation Smartphones'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['May 25, 2016']",2016-05-25 08:05:08+00:00,"['Photo source: Digital Trends                   As electronics devices like smartphones have evolved over the years, hardware components such as display, processor, and camera have significantly improved in performance and efficiency. One area where not enough development has been taken place is the battery. Now, researchers have engineered a next-generation battery technology, known as lithium-air batteries that could last five times longer than today’s commercial\xa0lithium ion batteries.  Next-generation lithium-air batteries have the ability to store ten times as much energy as lithium-ion cells. This is possible since lithium-air batteries breathe oxygen from the air with new soluble electrolyte catalyst materials (dimethylphenazine) to power the chemical reactions that release electricity, rather than storing an oxidizer internally like lithium-ion batteries do. The high energy density of the Lithium-air batteries can allow an electric car to drive over 600kms on a single charge and a smartphone to last a week without recharging.  The Lithium-air batteries are also flexible, allowing it to be used to power wearables and flexible displays in the future. However, this technology could take five to tens years before it can be used commercially in consumer devices and electric vehicles. Having said that, it’s a major step in the development of efficiency in batteries.        D.r Kyeongjae Cho, a professor and researcher at UT Dallas said, “ There’s huge promise in lithium-air batteries. However, despite the aggressive research being done by groups all over the world, those promises are not being delivered in real life.\xa0Automobile and mobile device batteries are facing serious challenges because they need higher capacity. This is a major step. Hopefully it will revitalize the interest in lithium-air battery research, creating momentum that can make this practical, rather than just an academic research study. “']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/battery.jpg']

The phone is powered by an Exynos Octa 7870 CPU that comes equipped with a total of eight Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 1.6Ghz. The Exynos Octa 7870 is the first midrange system on a chip (SoC) to feature 14nm FinFET process which means it is more power efficient than the traditional 28nm SoCs. Moreover, with octacore processor, the Galaxy J7 2016 is twice as fast as the 1.2Ghz quad-core fueling Galaxy J5 2016.        The Samsung Galaxy J7 2026 is available in 3 color options: Black, Gold, and White.  In terms of memory, the Galaxy J7 2016 has 2GB of DDR3 RAM and 16GB of onboard storage which can be further expanded via dedicated microSD card slot upto 128GB.

Early Impressions:  Although the Samsung Galaxy J7 2016 is an upgrade over last year’s Galaxy J7, but for a price of Rs. 27,990 it raises some questions to be answered. The phone goes head to head with recently launched  OnePlus X  (Rs.28,999) and  Redmi Note 3  (Rs.24,999), and it’s a shame to tell that the Galaxy J7 falls behind those two in almost every way.  While the OnePlus X comes with a beautifully crafted glass body and the Redmi Note 3 featuring a full metal jacket, the Galaxy J7 2016 offers the same outdated plastic build. Moreover both the OnePlus X and Redmi Note 3 provides full HD display, but Samsung for some reason still thinks 720P display is good enough in the age where almost every 25K phones come with a 1080P panel.   Another big disappointment of the Galaxy J7 2016 is the lack of important sensors like the fingerprint scanner, secondary noise-cancelling microphone, compass, gyro sensor, and auto brightness sensor. Talking about the performance, having used the phone for an hour or so, the Samsung Galaxy J7 didn’t feel as smooth and fluid like the OnePlus X and the Redmi Note 3. Apart from having a 14nm processor, the Galaxy J7 is nowhere near the Snapdragon 801 powered OnePlus X or the Snapdragon 650 powered Redmi Note 3.  What’s good about the Galaxy J7 2016 are the camera and battery life; areas where Samsung does ever so well each year.

This is the time of the year, where every new version of Android used to be introduced but this time, the developer version of Android N was launched earlier and only some handful of improvements to Android N were showcased, but what N stands for still remains a mystery. Including that there were a lot of things that were showcased on Google I/O. Here are few important keynotes from the Google I/O.  1. Google Allo and Duo  Google Allo  Google Allo  is an instant messaging app which is powered by Google’s AI or now what Google calls it as  “Assistant” . With Google Allo, instant messaging becomes more fun with smart replies suggested by the app itself based on the questions asked. Like  Google Now On Tap , it scans the texts and images on the screen and suggests users with useful replies and cards. The main focus of the app is to make the chats more human like, so there are many small elements to make things more intuitive, like when you are about to send a message you can drag the send button up or down to increase or decrease the size of text, meaning you’re whispering something or shouting out loud. If you don’t want to use the Google Now Voice Service, you can just chat with the Google Assistant and ask for questions that you’d normally ask on Google Now. Also, privacy has been a crucial thing when it comes to messaging, so Google doesn’t keep record of the things it scans while you chat, also you have the option for private messaging where you get End-to-End Encryption.  Google Duo  Duo  is what Google claims to be the fastest video calling platform with the use of  WebRTC . This app seems like a competition to Apple’s Face Time as the app is getting released on both Android and iOS. Google claims the Duo has been optimized in such a way that it runs even on low latency. Even though the UI is very minimal, a lot of things are going inside making it one heck of a fast and easy to use video messaging platform. The moment you call someone, you instantly get the video feed of that person before they even pick up the call, which seems like a major privacy issue to me. There might be an option to turn it off or enable it for only certain contacts.        What’s even great is that you can switch between mobile data and wifi without getting disconnected from the call.  But to sum it up, Google already has an IM app, Hangouts! Which hasn’t been able to live up to its competitors. Users have been complaining a lot about App fragmentation as Google has a lot of apps to do similar tasks and what a single app could to it has scattered that into multiple apps/products.  2. Android Instant Applications   Android Instant Apps  is a revolutionary feature which will redefine how we use an app. Most of the time we don’t carry around the app we use the least, but there might be times when you need the app instantly for something, let’s say shopping. So, when you search for a product online, instead of going to the web page of the product you are greeted with the site’s app instead, where you’ll have an easier time navigating around to buy products and pay for them if you have Android Pay available. Another example is: if someone sends you a link t\xa0a YouTube video but you don’t have the YouTube app installed on your device, when you click on the link of the video, the instant app instantly launches the temporary YouTube app enabling you to watch the video. This is possible because the app is installed from the server instantly and if you want to install the app permanently you can do so by the install option you get on the notification drawer.  3. Google Home   The future is full of  Internet of Things(IoT) , even if we’re ready or not, Google certainly is. For the last few years, we saw many IoT tech like the smart bulbs, smart kitchen accessories, security systems and the Digital Home Assistant\xa0 Amazon Echo . For all the IoT devices to sync and to control some of them, you need a central hub this is where the  Google Home  comes in. If you’re familiar with the Amazon Echo, it’s exactly the same, but it comes with the power of Google which means you have boarder usability. With Google Home Smart Assistant, you can easily ask questions, request services and many more. Google has yet to announce the comprehensive details about the Google Home but for the time being it still already feels pretty awesome.  4. Android N Improvements   Android N  is the next big update on the Android OS, which is yet to be released\xa0for the masses. Only the Developers are using it for testing and bug report but it will soon be out in late Fall for the public. Android N will more or less completely change how we use our Android devices. Though on the surface it looks similar to the lollipop but there are a lot of new features and design overhaul aiming to make Android experience even great and interactive.   Android N now comes with  Vulkan graphics API  which will give developers direct access to the GPU for better 3D graphics in games and apps.  JIT compiler  has been added which makes Android a whole lot faster, with JIT you can now install apps 75% faster than on Lollipop. Android N is also the first mobile platform to get the  Unicode 9 emoji  standard with the inclusion of 72 new emojis. And finally, we get the  Clear All  button on the top right corner which users have been demanding for a very long time. But the top right position is rather uncomfortable for a large device. For better memory management, the apps on the multitasking window are automatically removed if they are left idle for a long time. And security has been a major focus on Android N, now android has File based Encryption, Media Framework Hardening, and Seamless Android Updates.  5. Google Daydream   Google Daydream  is all about enabling very high quality mobile  VR \xa0experience.\xa0The new Virtual Reality mode is baked into Android N system. Google Daydream just won’t run on any device, you need a Daydream ready phone with high end sensors, display and processors. With Google Daydream, Google will be launching VR headset, VR controller that is optimized for VR that is both powerful and intuitive, also there will be Google Play for VR where you’ll be able to download VR apps, movies, videos and other cool stuffs. Apps like Google Play Movies, Google Street View and Google Photos will be some of the early VR compatible apps from Google. You’ll even have a VR system UI in the future where you’ll be able to interact with your device.  6. \xa0Android Wear 2.0   Android Wear 2.0  is the biggest update for Android Watches. Android Wear 2.0 for Developers is now available for download. Android Wears are something that is increasing gradually, there are a lot of brands showcasing their smartwatch which usually runs on Android but all of them had to depend mostly on the Smartphone to work properly. With the introduction of Android Wear 2.0, you can now have standalone apps for the watch which earlier required to sync with mobile app, there’s better support for third-party watch faces and the new  Carousel  app launcher is much improved compared to earlier launcher. The UI has been overhauled for easier navigation, input and showing results. You also get the intelligent message reply/suggestions, you’ve even got a keyboard for Android Wear now!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cover-1.jpg']

The phone is available for purchase from various Samsung mobile outlets located all over the country.  The 2016 model of the Galaxy J5 offers minor updates in the design and specification. It offers a matte plastic back and is quite handy and comfortable to use even with one hand. Specs-wise, the Galaxy J5 2016 sports a 5.2-inch 720P Super AMOLED display, is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 CPU (1.2Ghz, 64bit, cortex A53) and Adreno 306 GPU. It has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage which is expandable upto 128GB via microSD card slot. As far as the camera is concerned, the Galaxy J5 2016 boasts a 13MP autofocus rear camera with LED flash, f/1.9 aperture, and a 5MP\xa0front-facing camera with LED flash\xa0and\xa0120-degree wide-angle lens.         Powering the device is a 3100mAh removable battery. Connectivity options include a dual-SIM slot (with 4G LTE), dedicated microSD card, WiFi b/g/n, Bluetooth, and GPS. It is currently operating on Android Marshmallow 6.0 with the latest version of TouchWiz UI. The phone weighs 159gms and \xa0measures\xa0145.8 x 72.3 x 8.1mm in dimension. It comes with\xa0S Bike mode that was introduced recently in the Galaxy J3, and ultra data\xa0saving mode powered by opera max.  Initial Impressions:  Samsung Galaxy J5 2016 is a good phone, but there are lots of compromises done by Samsung yet again. The phone comes with a vibrant 5.2-inch AMOLED display, has decent\xa0rear and front camera, and boasts a huge 3100mAh battery which will provide superb battery performance. But, these are the only good features of the Galaxy J5 2016.  The phone sports an outdated Snapdragon 410 CPU; the processor that was used in last year’s budget phones like  Xiaomi Redmi 2  and  Lenovo A6000 Plus . If you are a heavy gamer, don’t expect anything extraordinary from the phone as the Snapdragon 410 CPU coupled with Adreno 306 GPU is not able to handle most of the high-end games. Moreover, the phone lacks important sensors like auto brightness sensor, Gyro sensor, and compass. Without the Gyro sensor, one will not able to use most of the Virtual Reality apps which are becoming more popular these days.      Pros  Cons    – Good Vibrant 720P display  – Outdated CPU    – Decent Rear and Front camera  – Lacks Gyro Sensor    – Excellent Battery Life  – Pricy compared to competition      If you are coming from a Samsung fan base, or you value brand rather than specs, the Samsung Galaxy J5 2016 might just be a perfect match for you. However, if you want better-specced phones, you should consider the  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3  that offers 1080P display, best in class Snapdragon 650 CPU, fingerprint sensor, and a huge 4050mAh battery.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Samsung-Galaxy-J-2016.jpg']

The base model of 16GB is priced at Rs. 57,950 and the 64GB model of the smartphone cost\xa0Rs. 13,000 more at Rs.70,950. It is available for booking from the  official oliz website  and will be available starting 19th May.   The iPhone SE was globally announced on March 22 alongside the 9.7-inch iPad pro. It looks similar to the 2-year-old iPhone 5s but packs powerful specs under the hood. It’s very much an iPhone 6s internals in an iPhone 5s body with little compromise and lesser price tag.         Key Highlights iPhone SE:\xa0   4-Inch Retina Panel with a Resolution of 640 x 1136 Pixels  iOS 9.3 Operating System  2 GB RAM  Apple A9 SoC with M9 co-processor  12 MP iSight camera\xa0with a dual-tone flash and 4K Recording  1.2MP Front Camera with f/2.4  Touch ID sensor First gen  Faster LTE, faster Wi-Fi (802.11ac), better battery life, New microphones, and the significant addition of Apple Pay support.   My Early Impressions on iPhone SE:\xa0  Although iPhone SE packs a lot of good specs from the iPhone 6s like the powerful processor, back camera, latest iOS, and touch ID, however, there are some decisions from Apple which I am not very fond of.\xa0Let’s start off with the design. The iPhone SE design is exactly the same as the 4-year-old iPhone 5s. I expected little more from Apple in its design. Although I am not a big fan of 4- inch display, but I understand there are lots of users who likes a small form factor in a smartphone. But, in this case, Apple cared to save a lot of time and money in Reseach and development in designing a new look.  iPhone SE Price in Nepal is Rs. 57950 for 16GB and Rs. 70,950 for 64GB. It is available in Silver, gold, space gray, and rose gold.  Secondly — the iPhone SE’s 16GB base model is an insult. With no microSD slot, the 16GB version will soon run out of storage. Moreover, there are compromises in some areas like the front camera which are becoming more useful these days, No forced 3D touch which someone can live without, and the outdated version of Touch ID sensor.  Don’t get me wrong here, as much I like the concept behind the launch of iPhone SE — an affordable compact phone with serious power underneath. However, I expected much from Apple, the tech leader in new innovations and strategies.  For a price of Rs. 57,950, you can get a  Samsung Galaxy S6 ,  Xiaomi Mi5  or the  Huawei Nexus 6P . However, if you want a phone with smaller form factor with an awesome camera and performance, and can live with a low-resolution display and front snapper the iPhone SE might just be right for you.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/iPhone-SE-price-in-nepal.jpg']

In the recent update of the Opera Browser Developers version, a new power saving mode was introduced which have claims of saving your laptop’s battery up to 49% than the previous version on Opera Browsers and 54% longer than that while using Chrome. On the test performed by Opera, the laptops battery lasted 3hours longer compared to running Chrome.  The tests were performed on a Lenovo X250 laptop with 16GB RAM running on 64-bit version of Windows 10, where 11tabs were opened with different websites where each page was scrolled five times and isolated for a minute and repeated again until the battery was dead.

['Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Review: Best Midrange Smartphone to Buy in Nepal'],"['Reviews', 'Xiaomi']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['May 13, 2016']",2016-05-13 14:56:38+00:00,"['A year before now, it was very inconvenient to buy Xiaomi’s products in Nepal. You heard they were cheap, you knew they were awesome, but you just couldn’t get your hands on one of them. It has all changed since Vatsal Impex has taken the authorization to officially import and distribute Xiaomi products in Nepal. We now have some range of Xiaomi phones like the Redmi 2, Mi4, Redmi Note 2 and what everyone is calling \xa0the “mid-range killer of 2016”, the Redmi Note 3.  Redmi Note 3 (2GB version) was launched in Nepal for Rs. 24,999 and 3GB variant was launced ifor Rs. 27,999 — Both of which falls in the midrange category. The phone comes with some stunning specs for its price, but let’s scale each of its key specs and find out if this phone is really worth the money and hype.  [ Disclaimer: Vatsal Impex provided a brand new Redmi Note 3 for us to review, and we have been using the handset for past few days as our daily driver. ] Design:  The design is one of the main highlights of the Redmi Note 3. It is the first phone from Xiaomi to sport a full metal body with the inclusion of fingerprint sensor, which sounds pretty good for a budget smartphone. The phone has curved back and chamfered edges which make\xa0the phone easy to hold and handle despite sporting a huge 5.5-inch display.            Design & build    1  of 6                                                                              The display itself looks really elegant with very small side bezels. By no means, the Redmi Note 3 feels cheap, it gives you the premium look and feel while holding it. When compared to other plastic and glossy body phones like the Galaxy J7 and Huawei Y6 pro, the Redmi Note 3 feels superior and flagship grade.    What we really liked about the fingerprint sensor is it’s located at the back of the device making it easier to press. Like fingerprint sensors on any flagship phones, it is pretty fast and accurate. It even sports an IR blaster so if you want a portable remote, you’ve got one with you all the time. For a budget phone, the Redmi Note 3 looks exquisite and is really well built.  Display:  Redmi Note 3 sports a 5.5-inch full HD IPS display which is pretty sharp at 401ppi. On our usage, we found the colors to be mild and on the warmer side which makes it easy to look without straining your eyes. However, at times, you wished you had a brighter screen while viewing colorful contents. But by no means it’s a bad display — it has very good viewing angles without much colors shifting. The sunlight legibility is also good with Xiaomi’s Sunlight Display feature which automatically increases the contrast under direct sunlight.   The display is protected by a layer of glass from an unknown manufacturer which Xiaomi claims is as good as Corning Gorilla Glass, but we recommend you to put a tempered glass protection as soon as you buy the phone.  Performance:  Redmi Note 3 is powered by Snapdragon 650 hexa-Core chipset which is a very powerful and  energy efficient mid-range chipset. On our day to day usage, we didn’t feel any lags or stutter. With the new MIUI7, everything was fast and buttery smooth. The new animations made it a whole lot fun to use the device and made the device seem more fluid.  The base model with 2GB RAM has decent memory management, if not the best. If you like to multitask a lot, we recommend you to go for the 3GB RAM variant. We could switch between 4 to 5 apps constantly without missing a beat. Even while playing high-end games, the memory was sufficient and ran most of the games smoothly at medium to high settings. The best part was we didn’t face any major heating issues while gaming or doing heavy multitasking. The phone did get noticeably hot, but it felt like nothing as it cooled instantly once you left the game or cleared the memory.\xa0Overall for the price you’re paying, Redmi Note 3 won’t disappoint you and it is capable of fulfilling some of your flagship phone needs.   Camera:  Redmi Note 3 boasts a 16MP Rear Camera with f/2.0 aperture and phase detection auto-focus which means you’ll get faster focusing and better low light imaging theoretically. On our test, the camera performed very well, if not the best. Pictures taken were pretty good under plenty of sunlight with accurate colors, noticeable dynamic range and had a decent amount of sharpness and saturation. Also taking pictures was pretty quick. But camera mostly underexposes the image so it lacks in detail than one would expect on a 16MP resolution.      Rear camera samples    1  of 4                                                          Turning the HDR mode will make things right for you, bringing out enough colors and details to make your images feel content. But it does make\xa0the camera a bit slower. Also, the Camera’s UI is pretty minimal like in the previous versions of MIUI. You also get a lot of inbuilt filters, but we personally think they are of minimum use. Rear camera records video at 1080@30fps which is pretty decent, but due to lack of OIS (Optical Image Stabilization)\xa0and software stabilization, it tends to get a bit shaky. However, the overall camera performance on the Redmi note 3 performs really great compared to any other smartphone in the same price category.   The 5-megapixel\xa0front camera comes with an F2.0 aperture lens and captures good selfies. However, it lacks wide-angle lens meaning it’s not so perfect for taking group photos or if you want to take wide shots.  Software:  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is running on Android 5.1 Lollipop with MIUI 7. For the first timers, you might feel weird about the MIUI, but once you keep using it you’ll feel right at home. To start off, it doesn’t have an app drawer. If you’re used to that, you’ll find it pretty easy to navigate around. You’ll start to notice the little details in the UI which makes using it a complete joy. There are hidden tweaks everywhere you only need to dig into the settings or google them for ease.      MiUI7    1  of 6                                                                              You won’t be disappointed with what MIUI has to offer. The overall UI is very colorful and vibrant. Although it’s a heavily skinned UI there isn’t any lag or stutter what so ever. Now with the inclusion of Fingerprint sensor the security has been updated and with the fingerprint sensor you can do a lot more here, like take pictures, unlock hidden folders, App lock, and third-party logins.  Battery:  With the Redmi Note 3, you get a\xa0massive 4000mAh battery which will easily last you for two days under normal usage and almost a full day on heavy usage. On our test, we got around 5.5 to 6 hour of screen on time and 8 hours of back to back video playback. Also, if you run out of charge anytime soon, Redmi Note 3 also includes quick Charge 2.0 first generation which takes about 1 hour to reach 50% from 0 and about 2.5 hours to completely charge the device.   Connectivity:  Connectivity wise, the Xiaomi Redmi Note sports a Dual hybrid SIM slot, which means you can either insert 2 SIM card or one SIM card and one microSD card. We only hoped that the handset had a dedicated SIM slots and a microSD card slot. Since there is a majority of users who uses 2 SIM card and 16GB inbuilt might not be sufficient. Other connectivity includes WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS.  Pricing:\xa0  The Redmi Note 3 pricing starts at NRs. 24,999 in Nepal which looks terrible when compared to Indian pricing (INR. 10,000 ~ NRs. 16,000). However, in India, Xiaomi sells through their own website and one has to register to get one. There are no retail shops, and its a hassle to get one.

If you fall into that category, you should consider the  Teclast X89\xa0Kindow  tablet. Priced just at $82.99, the device boasts a 7.5-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1440 x 1080 pixels which results in 240 ppi.

Mi5 may not be the sole flagship killer of 2016, but it is among very few phones in the market which can go head to head against the flagship phones of tech giants like  Samsung ,  Sony , and  LG  for half their price.  [ Update: Xiaomi Mi5 is now available for Rs. 39,999 in Nepal ]  Although the price is half as the other flagship phones, there’s no compromise in build, specs or any other aspects for that matter. Mi5 sports a full glass and metal body with curved chamfered edge, the resemblance of aesthetics is similar to that of the Galaxy S7.

It’s probably because they might have been a victim of its own success. The Xfactor Quad HD was one of the greatest budget phones ever made, one that my Ex is still using it. But the recent lineup of Colors phone has been pretty boring for a while. They all looked the same and were all replaced each year by newer models with slightly better specs and minor feature upgrades.  With the introduction of Elite E15, however, they are trying to regain its lost share market by offering a huge 5000mAh battery and a 6-month warranty on display for an asking price of just Rs. 13,995. Can the Colors latest offering reignite consumer’s love affair with the company again? Let’s find out in our detailed review.  Inside the Box Package:          Handset (White)  Extra back cover (Golden)  Tempered Glass  5V/1.5A Wall charger  USB to MicroUSB data cable  Earphone  Warranty card  User manual  Service center location card   Design:  Like most of the budget phones, the Elite E15 also comes with a plastic build, but what we really liked this time around is its textured back. It is less susceptible to smudges, fingerprint and holds perfectly in the hand. Despite featuring a 5000mAh battery, the phone weighs just 158gms and 8.9 millimeters. The weight is distributed evenly across the entire body making the phone easy to use even with one hand.      Colors Elite E15 Design    1  of 8                                                                                                  The power and volume keys are conveniently located at the right edge, but the tactile feedback of these buttons is average at best. Instead of going with the onscreen buttons, Elite E15 houses capacitive buttons, which are not backlit making it very difficult to see at times. The back of the phone is removable giving us an access to 2 SIM card slots and a microSD card slots. SIM one supports 3G while the SIM 2 supports 2G. The microSD card slot can take upto 32GB. Unfortunately, the battery is not accessible. Overall, we think the Elite E15 doesn’t really boast an innovative design, but nonetheless, it’s a solidly built device.  Display:  The Elite E15 sports a 5-inch 720p IPS display that has Dragon trail glass protection. The display is one of the best we have seen below 15,000 rupees smartphone. Color reproduction is accurate and indoor brightness levels are optimum. Sunlight legibility, however, is mediocre and the IPS panel is little reflective. Viewing angles is an asset while playing games and watching videos.   Despite featuring a Dragon trail glass, we did find the display to be vulnerable to minor scratches with normal day to day use. So, we recommend the potential buyers to put a tempered glass which you get inside the box itself.  \xa0\xa0  Software:  As seen on most of the Colors smartphone these days, the Elite E15 also runs on a stock version of Android. This time shipping with lollipop version 5.1. Apart from the Lollipop material design, we can see a theme store in the settings which change the look and feel of the interface to some extent.   Moreover, there are 2 major battery saving features. The first one is a super power mode that restricts the background data and keeps your brightness down to the lowest settings. The Extreme Power mode, on the other hand, adds a dark theme and allows users to use the only handful of apps. When you are running out of juice, this mode conserves a lot of battery and you could use the phone for almost 2 days. There is also a data saving app called Colors Lite in the notification interface which when turned on will compress the mobile and Wi-Fi data for upto 50%.   The only thing to complain in the software department is its still running an outdated Android Lollipop 5.1. Moreover, there is no official news on when in the future the phone is going to receive the Marshmallow update.  Performance:  The Elite E15 houses a Mediatek quad-core processor clocked at 1.3GHz. It’s an outdated 32bit processor which we have seen in a much cheaper phone like the Karbonn Sparkle V that’s priced at Rs.7500. We kind of hoped the phone had a more capable 64bit processor that would have boosted the performance by 20-25% and battery life by 20%.   The phone has 2GB of RAM and coupled with the 32bit quad processor and stock version of android, multitasking and apps opening are relatively fast. In daily use, the phone works fine and don’t lag much even after installing over 50 apps. RAM management is not that great though as it consumes almost over 1GB in most of the scenarios, with less than 30% of free memory.   Also, don’t expect anything extraordinary from it while playing graphics intensified games. The phone can run most of the mid-tier games like temple run and clash of clans, but with high-end games, the phone tends to heat up and eventually leading to dropped frame rates and lags.  Camera:  The camera department has been Colors missing link in the past, and the Elite E15 8MP rear camera is no different. The image quality of the main camera isn’t anything to write home about. The color produced by the camera are okay, but the dynamic range is poor. There’s a fair amount of noise, as well in the photos. It is also lacking in detail and if you want to take better photos, you better pick a very sunny day to do so, since low light imaging is below par.  The 5MP front-facing camera, on the contrary, takes above average pictures, and can be used for a selfie, groupies, and video chatting.  Connectivity and Call Quality:  The Colors Elite E15 comes with dual SIM support. The first SIM slot supports 3G, while the second SIM supports 2G. The phone lacks video calling feature, but the audio calling is fairly good. Talking about other connectivity, the phone has WiFi b/g/n ( no dual-band), Bluetooth 4.0, and GPS.   Battery:  Let’s now talk about the Elite E15 most important feature: The battery. The 5000 mile amp hour battery of the phone is amazing. Under heavy usage, it lasts for full working days. It will easily last for 2 days under normal usage.   In our intensive testing, the phone had 6 hours of onscreen time and 8 hours of video playback time, which is amazing for a phone that cost little over Rs.13, 000. Moreover, it has the ability to charge other phones as well. With the quick charge, it takes around 2.5 hours to charge from 0 to 100%, which is completely acceptable for a battery of that size.  Verdict:  As for the verdict, we recommend the Elite E15 for those who want their battery to last for a day under heavy usage or for those who are affected by long power cuts and cannot charge the battery every night. However, if battery life isn’t a concern, you will find a handful of phones under the same price bracket that is slimmer and faster. But the Elite E15 is all about the battery, and in that category, it has no competition. We only hope that Colors will pay more attention to the camera in their next generations of phones.']",[]
['How to enable Material Design on Youtube (WEB)'],[],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['May 8, 2016']",2016-05-08 03:58:56+00:00,"['YouTube  is our everyday go to platform, whether you’re bored, want to learn something new or need to search for anything specific, Youtube is the way to go. Besides Google, people search for most of the things on YouTube now, making it one of the most popular website all over the world. YouTube’s web UI has been versatile and has been receiving various visual updates time and again. But what it still lacked was the Google’s very own material design.   Now developers are implementing the material design on YouTube which has been available for developers only to test and debug. The changes to the UI is huge, everything is wider and more colorful, material colors gives a really good feel while using the site. But the redesigning is not complete yet, there are many design elements that are yet to be added or missing overall. The possibility is that on the final release you might not even see the same UI you’re seeing right now on the Developer Version.         The homepage is different and looks very wide and open, which seems like it needs more work. Other than that, the Color adoption on the channel page looks really beautiful with bright and playful colors. Also, the icons on the hamburger menu have been changed, they are now larger and more colorful. You can see material design adoption in a lot of places. There is the transparent Youtube Player and when you stretch the window you get this black tiles surrounding the player which makes the video watching more immersive letting you focus only on the video.  The idea is to make the mobile and web platform somewhat similar and we can clearly see the resemblance between these two from the material design update. But the whole thing is still in development, you might not feel right at home while using it for the first time, but it really is a welcome change and might make browsing Youtube more easy and fun.   Enable Material Design on YouTube (WEB)  1) Go to https: www.youtube.com/?gl=US  2) Open the developer tools (ctrl + shift + i)  3) Go to the `Resources´ tab and under Cookies>www.youtube.com section, delete the \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE cookie  4) Go to the Console tab and define the VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE cookie using the following command:  document.cookie=""VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=Qa1hUZu3gtk;path=/;domain=.youtube.com"";  5) Reload the page  Note:  You need to be logged out of your Google Account to see the changes. As it is still in development, Google hasn’t allowed users to Sign In and use the new UI. And we specifically tested this on Chrome, so other browsers might not follow the similar procedure. To exit the new UI you can simply login to your Google account and it’ll go away or you can select the three dotted menus on top right corner and select  “Restore Classic Youtube.”']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cover.jpg']

Priced at $149.99, the UMI Touch offers full HD display, octacore processor, and 3GB of RAM. We can’t think of any smartphones right now that offers such high specs for a midrange pricing.   Design and Build  The UMI touch goes a step ahead of the competition by offering a full metal body. While most of the midrange phones come with a plastic build, the UMI touch offers premium\xa0metal unibody design. The phone’s weight, though, is on a heavier side as it weighs at 190gms. That being said, the handset has a big 5.5-inch screen accompanied by a huge 4000mAh battery. As far as display specs are concerned, it houses a 2.5D cambered IPS LCD panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and a gorilla glass 3 upfront for protection against scratches and minor drops.         Hardware Specs  Under the hood, the UMI touch is powered by a 64 bit MediaTek MT6753 octacore processor coupled with Mali T720 GPU. We’ve seen this processor in many midrange phones and it is more than a capable chipset. It works fine with virtually zero lags during day-to-day operations. However, the GPU is not so powerful and struggles immensely while playing high-end games like Modern Combat 5 and Nova 3. In terms of memory, the phone has 3GB of RAM and 16GB of storage which can be further expanded for upto 128GB.  Talking about the camera, the UMI touch flaunts 13 megapixels back camera with\xa0F2.0 aperture lens and led flash. The sensor that’s being used is the Sony IMX328 which is one of the best camera sensors you can find in a budget phone. Upfront, there is 5 megapixels camera (hynix\xa0HI553) which is assisted by an LED flash. The phone is currently running the latest Android Marshmallow 6.0 out-of-the-box, and the user interface is nearly stock and bloat free.  [YOU MIGHT LIKE:  UMI SMARTPHONES LAUNCHED IN NEPAL ]  The biggest selling point of the UMI touch, however, is its huge battery. The 4000mAh Lithium-ion Polymer\xa0battery is rated to provide 15 days of standby time, 24 hours of browsing in 4G data, 60 hours of talk time, 92 hours of music playback, and 9 different movies in a single charge. Connectivity wise, the phone supports 2 SIM card slots with 150Mbps 4G LTE and comes with WiFi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, and GPS. It also sports a fingerprint scanner on the home button, which the company claims will unlock the phone in just 0.1 seconds.  Pricing and Buying Link  For those of you wanting to buy the UMI Touch, you can buy it from  gearbest.com  for a discounted price of $149.99.\xa0They accept payment methods such as PayPal, Wire Transfer, as well as the Western Union. Also, bear in mind that you need\xa0to pay for shipping fees and import taxes, wherever applicable.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/umi-touch.jpg']

"['VoIP Telephony in Nepal, Legal or Not !']",[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['May 1, 2016']",2016-05-01 11:30:39+00:00,"['Voice over Internet Protocol is commonly known as VoIP, is the most used technology to make a call by the means of the Internet around the globe. If anyone happened to know about  Google Voice , Facebook call, Viber etc. then the person is not untouched and unknown about the technology. But how about the underlying technology behind it and the context in Nepal.  Technology behind VoIP  In general VoIP technology was developed to make calls between the two specific people within the internet. Unlike traditional PSTN telephony, VoIP works by transporting the voice signals into data via IP. These signals then are broken down into the packets with the routeing information. The process includes breaking down and reassembling of voice data and changes into the voice. Within the process, the compression and the decompression of the data take place commonly referred as the voice quality.         Making calls using VoIP  Calls originated from the internet and destination being the internet is quite similar to the data packet transferring process. However in order to make and receive the calls, the softphone application must be installed on the user computer itself. The softphone is similar to the traditional dialling phone but this time, it is a computer or mobile application which will send the data from one softphone to another softphone. Softphone might be vendor specific e.g. skype, Viber, Facebook, Google etc. This vendor has their datacenter which will ultimately transfer the originating voice data to the receiver. Commonly known as On-Net Calls.  Calls to PSTN from VoIP  Transferring calls to PSTN and vice versa is the most discussed topic in the VoIP industry. Referred as call termination and (Session Initiation Protocol) SIP trunking. In this process, the originating call from Softphone is dropped into the vendor data centre and then dropped into the nearest PSTN network. In between these process, the calls are transferred from the SIP gateway. This gateway will convert SIP to PSTN or PSTN to SIP. However, PSTN to SIP is more of a broader prospect. The call quality depends on upon the vendor route provider and the audio codec that is being used by them. Most popular used codec is G721 but for the highest quality and having enough bandwidth the softphone caller can use G711 codec as well.  A Brief History of VoIP in Nepal  There is not proper information since when VoIP was introduced in Nepal. But as per my experience there was some kind of boom in VoIP market in Nepal during the 2000-2005 and then rooted since then. The main reason for its popularity was because of the high cost of the cross-border call in Nepal. This was because most of the Nepalese headed abroad to make their living. Since then and now the only reliable service provider was the Nepal Telecommunication.  Although there was few competitor but it was near impossible to compete with the government organisation – NTC (Nepal Telecommunication Corporation). Compared to another provider such as NCELL (Mero Mobile back then) and UTL (United Telecommunication) it was cheaper but was not much reasonable for the customer. The customer had to spend 25-40 Rupees per call/minute depending upon the destination. In order to avoid high price in making calls, the technology was introduced by the people from abroad who had used it at least once and thought they could help people and make money out of it.  Illegal in Nepal or is it?  There is a huge difference in understanding of VoIP being illegal in Nepal. But in fact, it is not what it seems. We can take an example to clarify this part. We everyday use Skype, Viber or any internet telephony services to make calls to our relatives abroad or from abroad to Nepal. These are not illegal. These Skype and Viber will charge anyone to make a VoIP to PSTN call, if the tax is paid during the purchase then it is legal. Similarly, any paid service that is being used by Cyber Café in Nepal is not illegal having said that it is used for personal purpose. But in the case of Cyber Café, it is just opposite, the tax is not paid and hence is illegal. In order to offer VoIP services, the entity has to obtain a service provider licence from the NTA (Nepal Telecommunication Authority).  However in few years, illegal VoIP has been covering headline in the news. This has put fear in the customer regarding the VoIP use. Demystifying this, it is very important to know , what those raids were which linked so-called high-class people .   As mentioned earlier, in VoIP business buying and selling calls are called call termination. Basically, these calls termination are done by telecom service provider. For example, if a person is calling to Nepal, then the caller service provider must buy the call/route from Nepal in order to land the call and vice-versa. Here comes the messy part. Illegal VoIP business comes to the existence with few devices, Sim Gateway, Sim (working one with the number), high-speed internet connection with static IP, software and Electricity. Basically, the Sims are put in a gateway.With the help of software, it can allocate vendor IP to transfer the calls from another end. Instead of the call going from the NTC gateway to the receiver now the call would go from the NTC to dodgy sim gateway and to the receiver. This will lead to a huge loss for NTC. Because the calls are made as a normal call, NTC will not be benefited much other than a normal call. But on the other hand, the person who has setup, such would sell the calls at a higher price in dollars and benefit out of it.  The quality of the call depends on upon the internet connection, the number of calls per second and the availability of the sim. Normally with the VoIP, there are three ranges, Silver, Gold and the Premium or grey, white or premium. The quality is determined by how free the ports (SIM) are, and how long the call can continue in a given specific time. White, Gold are relatively fine compared to the silver and gold. However, the premium is expensive. It is expensive because the ports must be freed all the time.  It is always better to make calls in and out from the proper service provider which pays the tax. Some examples of licenced provider are Call Bidesh,Broad Tel,CT Talk,Radius Call, EasyPhone and much more.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_50197894-global-voip-scaled.jpg']

Many application includes features that dramatically lowers the battery life and without paying attention to it your devices charge will soon run out.  Top-notch Android phones are really powerful but, unfortunately, they don’t have endless battery life. In fact, many android users would be happy to make it through a single day hoping that a nightly recharge would be sufficient. But sadly it isn’t sometimes.There are a lot of things that should be kept under consideration to increase or maintain a good span of battery life.  1. Brightness of the Screen:  Your screen especially the new one like IPS display suck up more battery from your device. The AMOLED display are more power efficient since the LED don’t have to produce blacks. By default the brightness is in auto adjustment mode, which works fine but, it is recommended to put it down to 10% which works well in indoor places. But this can be toggled outdoor using a power control widget on your home screen.         2. Cellular Data:  Cellular data are also the best battery drainers. Even though you have a brand new 4G or a\xa0 3G phone your data will use up the same battery even when you are not using the phone. Sending a text message via Viber, we chat, Line application as such EDGE or 1X is more than sufficient. And you can turn the data on if you need an extra speed. It is difficult to maintain the process but will definitely save you a lot of battery charge.      Smartphones with the Best Battery Life in Nepal [Updated]  Posted: June 18, 2020    Battery life is one of the most important aspects of a smartphone. Since it is the powerhouse of a cell-phone, it is a vital part that keeps the phone running. And so, it is also one of the major things to consider while buying a smartphone. Even if a phone is capable of doing a […]   3 comments    Handover and its impact in Smartphone Battery:  When you are using a smartphone with a GSM or a CDMA SIM, there is a process called locking. The smartphone locks with a base station\xa0(tower) that has the strongest signal. This process occurs even when the phone is not in use.  Photo source: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/  When you are travelling in a vehicle, the phone will connect with another base station so that the phone stays connected to the network. This process takes more power since during the “handover” the signal strength is lower, hence impacting battery life.  Even if you are not travelling, handover process can still occur. For eg. in a densely populated area, there are many base stations meaning your phone\xa0is always searching for the best network with the strongest signal. Also, if you are living in an area with lots of signal interference like buildings, and trees, accessing the base station in such areas requires more energy to mitigate the interference, again juicing up more battery from your phone.  3. GPS:  GPS are very best in sucking battery. It can be called the most battery killer in an android phone.\xa0The Global Positioning System (GPS) has to receive and decode time signals that come out from satellites. If the signal is weak, then the processor has to decode more meaning the battery consumption is more. Similarly, while you drive a car and use GPS for navigation, the time signal from the satellite is being sent repeatedly for accuracy. If you are not using GPS, then we recommend you to switch it off when not in use.   4. Power Consuming Processors:  Gone are the days when smartphone used to have a single core or dual core processors. Now, almost all the smartphones come\xa0equipped with quadcore or octacore processors. As weird as it might listen, the increment of cores is done to\xa0make the battery life better.  photo source: coding4.net  Smartphones processor sports ARM’s big.LITTLE architecture that features a small energy efficient 64 bit Cortex A53 cores and high performing 64 bit Cortex A57 cores. The Cortex A53 cores come into play when you are doing light tasks such as sending email, chatting, or watching movies. The Cortex A57 cores are only used when you are playing high demanding 3D games, and capturing 4K videos. More often, we see smartphones with Cortex A7 processor which is again an energy efficient cores, but unlike the Cortex A53 cores, the former boasts a 32bit architecture. So, if you are buying a new smartphone, always check if the processor has a 64 bit Cortex A53 cores.  5. Sync:  The built in Email feature (not Gmail, it uses push technology) can badly consume a lot of battery. Facebook, Twitter, weather app and many other application are used to syncing data from the web. It usually is set to auto sync, this can be turned into manual sync from the option in the setting. Turning this to manual sync or syncing time set to an along period can help to prevent battery to drain a lot less.   6. Animated (Live) Wallpaper, Home widgets:  Just because the Home widgets are there sitting on your home screen and seem inactive but they are draining a lot of battery. The live wallpaper which seems to look cool as a wallpaper is very good in draining battery. So removing these are a good way to save battery.  7. Signal Strength:  Being in an area where there is very less strength signal can also take part in draining a lot of battery charge from the battery. This is because when a mobile phone has a weak signal the phone tries hard to search for signals which use a lot of power and also comes in the list of battery drainers. There is nothing that can be done for this but is also the culprits for your dead battery.   8. Using a rooted phone:  Using a rooted phone also makes an android phone battery to resist more. A suggestion can be using a autostart\xa0 utility which can be used to keep the application from launching them automatically. Since this is something you cannot do on a non-rooted phone.   These are not only the facts that make your battery drain fast but are the most common facts that are responsible for draining battery.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/battery-smartphones-nepal.jpg']

Other OS like Symbian, Blackberry OS, and Firefox OS has simply given up on their take on smartphone\xa0OS but the Ubuntu hasn’t given up yet. Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu has launched their software on a flagship phone, Meizu Pro 5 and marketed as  Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition.  Meizu Pro 5 was a great phone launched last year which had all the design and specs that featured in last year’s flagship phone. It sported an aluminum unibody design and had great design aesthetics with sleek curves and chamfered edges. On the specs side, it sports a 5.7inch Super AMOLED FHD display and features 2.5D glass curved along the aluminum body of the phone. Meizu Pro 5 is powered by Exynos 7420 Octa-Core chipset which was used in Samsung Galaxy S6 and is coupled with 3GB of RAM, it comes with 21MP Camera with Sony Sensor, Fingerprint Scanner on the front, USB Type-C port for data syncing and charging with quick charge support and all of this is backed up by 3050mAH battery. We still have to see how much of the hardware resources Ubuntu can utilize to create a great user experience.  Souce: techvicity  With a phone running on Ubuntu you might be limited to only certain tasks as compared to other OS since you have a very small array of apps on the app store. If Ubuntu is aiming to grow on a mobile platform it will take more than just a flagship hardware to attract the users, software wise it needs a lot of improvement to compete with giants like Android and iOS. But it’s exciting to see new players coming in the market with something different to offer. Basically, there’s nothing new or useful this OS can offer to the masses except the new look and feel on a phone with some Ubuntu’s native desktop features, but  Convergence  is something to watch out for from this OS. Like Microsoft’s  Continuum , Convergence allows users to run native Ubuntu Desktop OS with full-screen support and multitasking on a monitor powered by the smartphone. This is a very neat feature and its demand on a smartphone or any other smaller handheld device is inevitable in the future.        Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition Specifications:   5.7inch Super AMOLED Full HD Display (1080*1920) @386PPI  Corning Gorilla Glass 3 Protection  Exynos 7420 Octa Chipset  Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57 CPU  Mali-T760MP8 GPU  32GB Internal Storage, Expandable up to 128GB  3GB RAM  21 MP Rear Camera with f/2.2, 31mm, phase detection & laser autofocus, dual-LED Flash  5 MP Front Facing Camera with f/2.0  Fingerprint Scanner  USB Type-C  Fast battery charging: 65% in 30 min  Non-removable Li-Ion 3050 mAh battery   For all that it offers, the phone is priced at just $370 and it’s not the phone for the masses. Only a handful of developers might even get this phone in Nepal but if Ubuntu keeps developing as a Mobile OS platform it won’t be long before we see it in the hands of general consumers.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/meizu-pro-5-ubuntu-os.jpg']

Recently launched Sony Xperia M5 is no longer a mid-tier phone and comes with premium specs and build, not to forget its hefty price tag.  The Xperia M5 was  announced in August of 2015   and you can buy it here in Nepal for Rs. 46,500 from official Sony stores. Talking about the handset, the Xperia M5 sports a 5-inch display with a resolution of\xa01920×1080 pixels. It is powered by MediaTek’s latest SoC Helio X10 that has 8 cortex A53 cores running at 2.2Ghz Frequency. The phone comes with 3GB of RAM and 16GB of inbuilt storage expandable via microSD card upto 128GB.         In terms of camera, the Xperia M5 has 21.5MP rear camera that can shoot videos in 4K.\xa0The M5 camera uses a hybrid auto-focus system to bring focusing time down to a mere quarter of a second. It has a f/2.2 lens and can do up to ISO 3200. It also supports 5x zoom with no perceptible loss in quality and 4K video recording. The Xperia M5 is also a selfie lover\xa0dream phone with its\xa013-megapixel front camera.

The Helio X10 performs well during multitasking as it has 8 cores to work with. However, the low performing Cortex A53 cores don’t live upto the expectation while playing high-end games and recording 4K videos. At similar prices, one can get a One Plus two and LG G4–both equipped with a better system on a chip.  However, with the Xperia M5 you get the premium design and build quality. It has the metal and glass build which is one of the best in class. Moreover, the phone is IP65/68 rated, which is it is water and dust proof. The Xperia M5 also comes with a dual SIM functionality and microSD expansion which most of the high-end phones these days don’t include. So ,what do you think of the Xperia M5? Is it a good buy for Rs.46,500? Give your thoughts in the comment below.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Xperia-M5-nepal.jpg']

"['8 Things to Consider Before Buying Mobile, Smartphone, Tablet']","['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['April 23, 2016']",2016-04-23 08:09:53+00:00,"['Buying New Smartphone                  The smartphone industry is growing and the competition between companies has attained an unprecedented height. Every now and then, we see smartphone companies launching their latest phones with new features and specifications, so you just need to be careful while buying a new device to get the best out of it.  There are lots of things that you have to consider while buying a new handset, such as the size and build quality, performance and storage capacity, camera specifications, etc. However, before going through it, you need to make a checklist on what your expectations are from the device. You also have to focus on your budget which will help you get the best out of it.  #1 – Price and Budget  It is recommended to make checklists for that device you want to buy. It depends on you that how much you are willing to pay for that device and what exactly your budget. So, the first important step of buying a new smartphone \xa0is to fix the budget and then research according to the price selected.         #2 Screen Size and the Quality  Lots of people like bigger screen smartphones while some prefer a smaller screen. Because the bigger screen will help us to view everything clearly and in better form while smaller screen can be more comfortable to handle.  Recently launched  iPhone SE  was a smaller compared to  iPhone 6 and 6S . Now, this can be a perfect phone for a person who wants to buy a small screen phone with iOS.  The size of the screen and its display type and pixel density as well. If that device doesn’t have a better quality of screen size every time you will feel sorry for yourself for buying.  #3 Thickness and Weight  Nowadays, we can see lots of people wanting a slim smartphone on their hand. But only slim and thin smartphones are not what you really need. You should be aware that, there will always be a compromise in order to provide you best smartphone. In most of the case with a slim thin smartphone, battery capacity or quality is compromised. (Not true in all cases).  The thickness and weight is an important factor while buying any gadgets. Usually, phones with higher battery capacity have more weight. But, a heavy phone can be uncomfortable to the users for mobility purposes.  #4 Operating System Software  An operating system is the major software of the\xa0mobile devices and tablets. The apps you run are working on top of the OS. Android, iOS, Windows Phone operating system, Blackberry OS, Ubuntu are some example of common OS used in Smartphones or Tablets.   Consider using the latest mobile operating system as possible  (Android N 7, Android Marshmallow 6)  \xa0or a previous version of operating system.  Follow up on the brand of the manufacturer to make sure you gets regular updates. Example:  Micromax ,  Intex ,  Lava  and many cheap manufacturers are short in providing regular updates.    #5 Storage Capacity Mobile  Due to the better cameras and better quality Videos, the storage capacity is always a concern for everyone. Even though, cloud services are being rapidly used to transfer your data from your devices.  Storage Capacity is being huge issues in low-end smartphones. Usually the internal storage, which leads to lagging or slowing down of system software.\xa0Everybody wants huge storage capacity on their mobile devices to store each and every moment of their life. But, now considering a smartphone with High Internal Storage (ROM) and decent external expansion storage and do the job well.  If you are movie lover than you will need to store movies on your smartphone and for that you will need to have huge storage capcity.  Recently Launched  Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge  brought back the expansion slot. This opened a whole new level of customers. Another Launch iPhone SE of 16GB can be a pain for recent buyers because of the missing expandable storage. So, It is recommended to look at the Internal Storage as well as external expandable storage.  #6 Camera\xa0of Device and Tablet  The camera is nowadays one of an essential hardware in a mobile or a tablet. Whether you want a landscape, cityscape, or just a portrait your smartphone is there. During recent years, front camera quality and features have improved. Features like LED Flash in the secondary camera, Panorama, HDR and more have come with newer devices.The introduction of 4K recording capabilities, slow motion videos have changed the way we can capture the world.  Megapixel is not the only thing to look while choosing a camera phone or choosing a better camera. Example: The Samsung Galaxy S6 had 16 MP camera, but dropped to 12 MP, but the camera of S7 is better. Also, the  Colors K3  has a 13MP camera, but this cannot be compared to S7 12MP camera.  #7 Hardware Configuration  Hardware configuration is the most important factor to look while buying a smartphone. Without a good hardware feature on a\xa0device, you will get slow processing speed and also a very unresponsive smartphone overall. Do check about the hardware, Is it ok for Gaming? Or Its it ok to run specific app?  The important thing that will make your device faster and better is RAM, ROM and Processor so always focus on getting a better quality of hardware inside your device. Heating of devices are usually caused by overusing or bad hardware configuration.  #8 Extra Features  Nowadays lots of peoples are looking for quick access features. Television and video streaming features, Fingerprint, NFC, Screen Mirroring, water resistant and much more. So, these various features might come with your budget. But not having these features does not make your phone a dumb phone.  Final Words  Buying a smartphone is not an easy task.

The central bank of Bangladesh just gave all of us future bank owners a very important lesson — don’t skimp on network security.  Hackers managed to steal about $81 million from Bangladesh Bank thanks to the bank’s use of $10 network switches and a complete lack of firewalls,  Reuters reported . It is one of the largest amounts stolen from a bank at once in history.  The theft happened in February when the hackers got into Bangladesh Bank’s systems, grabbed credentials, and then made dozens of requests from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to move money from Bangladesh to accounts in the Philippines and Sri Lanka. The transactions were stopped because they made a typo, spelling “foundation” as “fandation,” which caused a routing bank to question the Bangladesh Bank.        If the hackers didn’t make that spelling error, they could have successfully stolen nearly $1 billion from the Bangladesh central bank,  Reuters reported in March .  An investigation brought up the fact that Bangladesh Bank used very cheap network switches and had no firewall in place, making it incredibly easy for hackers to grab login credentials and the like. The bank’s system, which is essentially open to anyone who can get their hands on credentials, is connected to the SWIFT global bank payment network, which is a network that allows for high-value bank transfers.  According to Reuters, the police have knowledge of people who received the money from the central bank of Bangladesh but do not know the identities of the hackers. This is partially because of the bank’s cheap hardware — better network switches would have been able to trace exactly where the hackers were accessing the network from.  A bit more money spent on even a minor amount of security could’ve saved Bangladesh Bank over $80 million.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAGJ001876.jpg']

It is huge compared to any other online communication network. Messenger has been improving a lot with new helpful features being added every now and then. And the recent material design overhaul gave the app a much-needed facelift.

For convenience, Messenger has become an all in one platform for online social gathering where you can do a lot of stuffs which other service providers/apps provided as a standalone feature.  More integration is what the new update of Messenger suggests which includes Group Calling feature (VoIP) for up to 50 users which is a pretty good start to take on services like Skype and Google Hangouts. I guess nobody wants to be in a group call where there are 50 peoples but it will still be a luxury on the palm of our hands. VoIP on Messenger was introduced in 2014 and now it has taken a step further to become a multi-user communication platform. \xa0It would be pretty convenient for conference calls, group projects and other stuffs. This feature is mainly targeted for Business group who will be utilizing this feature the most. It won’t take much time for Facebook to introduce the feature of Video Group Calling in the near future which will be a major thing for a Billion user.  The update should be rolling out within a day or two for both Android and iOS and the feature should be mentioned in the changelog.

['5 Types of Cyber Crime in Nepal You should know About'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['April 20, 2016']",2016-04-20 13:51:28+00:00,"['The internet is a medium which enables the spread of information and communication between people at a world-wide level. The internet is a ‘free’ medium, with no international laws and regulations upon it, therefore, it is extremely difficult to both monitor and prohibit transactions that occur within it.\xa0A Cyber Crime is an act of creating, distributing, altering, stealing, misusing and destroying information through the computer manipulation of cyberspace; without the use of physical force and against the will or interest of the victim.  5 Main Cyber Crime in Nepal  Social Media Related Cyber Crime  Social Media related cyber crime in Nepal includes using Porn Content in social Media or creating fake profiles to intentionally harm someone with the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any social Media Platform.  In the year 2070, a total of 19 cases of Social Media Cybercrimes were reported. With the trending use of Social Media, the number of cases has increased to 35 in 2072. It has been seen that the number of female victims is more. Using Naked Pictures in social Media to take revenge has been the most cases according to Crime Investigation Bureau (CIB) Nepal.        A Government staff name Raju Shah was under police custody when a comment against the contemporaneous home minister Bam Dev Gautam was tracked on Facebook. Raju Shah was found guilty when he demanded death sentence against Minister Bam Dev Gautam who was caught in a photo breaking a traffic rule.   Piracy Related crime  Any Content which has been copied to make a duplicate copy is considered as Piracy. Using unauthorized trademarks and copying source code without having the License to use it is considered Piracy Crime.  Example, the font used in Company logos can also be related to piracy crime, if the font is not listed free for business purposes. Even though this related crime is not a possibility in today’s context of Nepal, but we can see a various example of Font piracy. Read a story of\xa0 Font Piracy .  Also, Source Code piracy case have been heard in Nepal lately. Since the case has not been solved, the whole story is an unsolved mystery. It has been allegedly reported that a software company filed a case against a Media House for copying their source code.  Fake Profile Marketing  Creating or using a fake profile, fake website or email to create a bad image or inappropriate marketing is also considered as cybercrime. We can see various examples of fake profiles, fake websites, and spam emails. Spreading unwanted and inappropriate message using fake profile is considered a Fake Profile Marketing. This rule also implies to businesses where a fake product is sold. Marketing of fake duplicate product using the name of a different brand also comes under the Fake Marketing Cyber Crime.   Threatening\xa0Using Email   Email threat is not much common cybercrime in Nepal. If an email contains a threat or warning in mentality to harm or disturb any individual or any organisation, this is considered as a cyber crime.   Website Hacking  Website Hacking means taking control from the website owner to a person who hacks the website. Nowadays most of the government websites are attacked by hackers. Many governmental websites including the president’s website were hacked. Any complaint on website hacking can be a serious offence in terms of the cyber law in Nepal.  Recently, a group of Nepalese hacker named  Anonymous opnep \xa0breached into the server of Nepal Telecom. Hackers gained access to all the details of NTC users that include username, citizenship name, father’s name as well as other private information.

['Panasonic Eluga Mark Review: Great Phablet For its Price'],"['Panasonic', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['April 20, 2016']",2016-04-20 05:39:47+00:00,"['Allied Tradelink, the authorised distributor of Panasonic smartphones in Nepal recently launched their latest phone,  Eluga Mark . Priced at Rs. 21,990, it has a fingerprint scanner which we normally don’t see on a midrange phone that’s currently available in Nepal. The fingerprint scanner is located on the back of the device and works perfectly fine and unlocks the phone in less than a second.  When it comes to design, it has a plastic back like most of the previous generation phones from Panasonic. The back is removable, however, the battery is non-removable. Just can’t understand why smartphone brand does that… There is a dual SIM slot with first sim slot supporting 4G while the second sim support 3G. There is a microSD card slot for memory expansion for upto 32GB.  Panasonic Eluga Mark is a cheapest Android based smartphone to feature a fingerprint scanner. It is priced at Rs. 21,990.  So Up front, the screen is of 5.5 inches, but the resolution is only HD giving us the pixel density of around 267ppi. While using it for some time, I had no problems with the display. It looks bright, and the IPS panel has good color reproduction and viewing angles. The touch is also responsive. What we didn’t like at our first impression is the big bezels the display has and also, the screen is deprived of any kind of protection, which is a letdown considering the pricing.         Taking about the Software, Panasonic has kept the interface neat and tidy with a stock version of Lollipop 5.1. Although you can find some minor changes with the inclusion of this fit home UI that is intended to help users to use the phone with one hand, after all, it’s a pretty huge phone.  Under the hood, there are some interesting specs. The phone is powered by a QUALCOMM Snapdragon 615 System on a chip which is an Octacore 64bit processor. With 2GB of RAM onboard, the phone is quite fast and didn’t lag during our test. The more than capable Octacore processor and 2GB of RAM is more than enough for day to day task and has no issues while playing low end to mid end games. That being said, the phone does heat up exponentially when you play high graphics demanding games for more than 5 mins.  What I really liked about the phone though is its camera. The 13MP back camera will not disappoint you as it can capture really good photos with fairly good details during daylight and even under a low light condition, the phone doesn’t disappoint. However, the front camera isn’t that great considering the aggressive competition of selfie powered phones at this price range.  This phone has got a 2500mAh battery which is a decent performer, but don’t expect anything extraordinary from it. It will easily last you for a day under normal usage, but since the phone heats up a lot, the battery drains faster while playing games. Also, the phone lacks quick charging technology and fast wall charger, which means it takes roughly around 3 hours to get fully charged from 0% to 100%.  As for the verdict, I really liked the phone despite having some heating issues and front camera not being that good. However, it has a good vibrant 5.5-inch display, has a capable processor for day to day activity, has an excellent rear camera, and offers decent battery life. If your budget is around 20-22,000 and want a phone with a fingerprint sensor and if you are not a selfie maniac, then it should be an ideal phone for you.']",[]

Ltd  recently launched the  Huawei Y6 Pro \xa0in Nepal  as a successor of the  Huawei Y6 . Like the previous generation, the\xa0Huawei Y6 Pro is also a mid-range smartphone in terms of specs, but the phones best selling point is obviously its massive Li-Po 4000mAh non-removable battery with quick charging support. It is priced at  Rs. 22,499  and yet again Huawei has decided to launch the phone in Nepal with exorbitant pricing. FYI, this phone is priced at around $150 in China.  [Update: Huawei Y6 Pro is now available for Rs. 17,999]  Pricing aside, lets’s have a look at the phone itself. The design is nothing to write home about. It sports a plastic back which most of the midrange phone comes equipped with. However, the back comes with a textured body which in my opinion looks nice and classy. The frame is not metal which one would expect in this price range.        The back is removable, but like most of the Huawei phones these days you don’t have access to the battery. It comes with 2 SIM slots and a microSD card slot that can be expandable upto 128GB. Talking about the display, it has a 5 inch HD display which is the same LCD panel that was used in its previous version Y6. That big bezel doesn’t look attractive, however, there is an onscreen button which is a welcome edition. The LCD panel is good, produces accurate color, but I noticed the brightness is not that great considering the pricing.   Apart from that, Huawei has not mentioned what kind of protection the glass comes with. One would have liked to have a gorilla glass after paying over 20,000 bucks. The Software UI is Huawei’s in-house Emotion UI that’s running Android 5.1. If you haven’t used Huawei phones before, you will feel like using a completely different Operation System. There’s no App drawer, the notification bar looks different and so does the lock screen.  The biggest letdown of the Huawei Y6 pro is its processor. It houses a quad core 1Ghz Mediatek 64bit processor which isn’t a big performer. The phone will start to lag when you install over 50 apps. However, on a brighter side, the processor consumes less amount of energy resulting in a great battery life thanks to its huge 4000mAh battery. It’s one of the few phones that has over 6 hours of onscreen time and if you want a phone that lasts over 2 days under normal usage, you should get this one.  Having said that, the 13MP rear camera is just mediocre at best. Though it has capabilities to capture nice photos during daylight, low light photography is average for a phone with F2.0 aperture lens. The 5MP front camera, on the other hand, does a decent job during selfies, groupies, and video calling.  VERDICT:  I am kind of disappointed with the phone’s pricing rather than the overall specs. With competition so high these days with the introduction of  Redmi Note 2  that has got a full-HD display, Helio X10 Octacore processor, and really good 13MP camera and then there is  Gionee M5 Lite  that comes with 4000mAh battery, metal body, and 3GB RAM, it’s very difficult for us to recommend the Huawei Y6 Pro.']",[]

Also, the version that is launched in Nepal just comes with the Internal Storage of 8GB which is fairly low for multimedia needs and as a phone launched in 2016 it still runs on Android 5.1.1 lollipop. But what’s amazing about this phone is the 8MP Rear Camera capable of shooting full HD video and a 5MP Front Facing Camera. Despite being a budget phone its camera won’t let you down.

['Huawei launches P9 and P9 Plus with Dual Camera'],['Huawei'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['April 7, 2016']",2016-04-07 03:55:17+00:00,"['Image Source: The Verge                  With  all the hypes and numerous gimmicks , we have finally witnessed the all new  Huawei  P9 and surprisingly a P9 Plus as well. Huawei has been teasing for a month or so about the P9 and the rumours and leaks have already suggested some of the specs and looks of the phone including the dual camera. Now we have two variants of the P9, the P9 itself sports a 5.2inch 1080p display while the P9 Plus sports a 5.5inch Super AMOLED screen. The biggest addition to these new devices is the dual camera module made with the partnership with Leica which Huawei claims to be the best camera on a smartphone.  P9 Specifications in Details  The P9  sports a 5.2inch 1080p AMOLED display with unibody aluminum construction which looks like the last years Huawei’s flagship the P8. The phone is thin at just 6.95mm and weighs just 144grams. P9 also comes with a fingerprint sensor on the back like the  Mate 8  and it’s crazy fast which takes less than a second to unlock the device. Also, we have the dual camera module without any humps so the back side looks really clean. P9 also comes with USB Type C for charging and data transfer but Huawei hasn’t confirmed whether it supports fast charging or not for its huge 3000mAH battery. Also, the P9 is rocking the Huawei’s in-house chipset the Kirin 955 octa-core processor and comes with 3GB RAM and either 32/64/128GB internal storage.Huawei P9 comes with Android Marshmallow 6.0 with Emotion UI on top with not so many changes in the UI or features.  P9 Plus Specifications in Details  P9 Plus  on the other hand sports a large 5.5inch 1080p Super AMOLED screen which is pressure sensitive like the last years  Huawei Mate S . P9 Plus comes with 4GB of RAM. Also the P9 plus sports an IR Blaster and comes with a larger 3400mAh battery. Despite this, all the other specs are similar to that of P9.         Dual Camera  The big headline about the P9 is its dual camera sensor. Both the camera are 12MP. The first camera has an RGB sensor and the second camera has a monochrome sensor which only takes black and white photos. Both the camera simultaneously takes the photo and combines them to produce a greater quality image. Using monochrome sensor allows the camera to capture just the light, not the color, so it has higher details and sharpness while the RGB sensor takes the photo in color which filters the lights coming to its sensor resulting in loss of details so when both the photos are combined a better quality image is obtained. This is noticeable particularly in bright highlights and dark shadows where details are easily missed by single/small sensors. Also, the dual camera sensor on the P9 and P9 Plus allows us to select multiple focus points which give a greater depth of field with closer shots. But the P9 doesn’t comes with Optical Image Stabilization and hasn’t talked much about the Video Shooting capability of P9’s camera. And on the front, there’s an 8MP camera. All and all the camera on P9 is supposed to be crazy fast and take high-quality photos and seems like the dual camera will be a thing in all smartphones in coming years but as of now only the P9 and LG G5 have a dual camera.  Huawei claims that using two sensors lets the P9 capture 270 percent more light than an iPhone 6S, and 70 percent more light than a Galaxy S7.   Both the P9 and P9 plus will come in Rose Gold color as well with other color options like Ceramic White, Haze Gold,Titanium Grey, Mystic Silver and Prestige Gold. Huawei is splitting the specs of P9 based on different countries, like the European countries will get expandable storage but will have only 32GB variant while the China and other countries will have Dual Sim support along with Internal Storage up to 128GB. We have to see which variant of P9 will launch in Nepal.  Huawei will start shipping P9 later this month and is priced at $650 and the P9 Plus will start shipping in mid may with the price tag of $800. We hope to see these phones next month or so as Huawei Smartphones Nepal has always been launching the phone closer to international launches.

To brief in one sentence: It’s very much an iPhone 6s internals in an iPhone 5s body with little compromise and lesser price tag.

My Early Impressions on iPhone SE:\xa0  Although iPhone SE packs a lot of good specs from the iPhone 6s like the powerful processor, back camera, latest iOS, and touch ID, however, there are some decisions from Apple which I am not very fond of.\xa0Let’s start off with the design. The iPhone SE design is exactly the same as the 4-year-old iPhone 5s. I expected little more from Apple in its design. Although I am not a big fan of 4- inch display, but I understand there are lots of users who likes a small form factor in a smartphone. But, in this case, Apple cared to save a lot of time and money in Reseach and development in designing a new look.   Secondly — the iPhone SE’s 16GB base model is an insult. With no microSD slot, the 16GB version will soon run out of storage. Moreover, there are compromises in some areas like the front camera which are becoming more useful these days, No forced 3D touch which someone can live without, though, and the outdated version of Touch ID sensor.  Don’t get me wrong here, as much I like the concept behind the launch of iPhone SE — an affordable compact phone with serious power underneath. However, I expected much from Apple, the tech leader in new innovations and strategies.   For a price of Rs. 57,950, you can get a  Samsung Galaxy S6 ,  Xiaomi Mi5  or the  Huawei Nexus 6P . However, if you want a phone with smaller form factor with an awesome camera and performance, and can live with a low-resolution display and front snapper the iPhone SE might just be right for you.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/iPhone-SE-price-nepal.jpg']

Both of these phones, as claimed by Samsung, falls under the  Samsung’s mid-range phone category  which comes with really astounding specs and built although considering the mid-range tag given to it. But A series is all about its beautiful aesthetics. The Samsung Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7 2016 Launched are priced at  Rs.48,490  and  Rs.55,490  respectively in Nepal.  Samsung Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7 2016 Launched in Nepal  Samsung Galaxy A5 2016:  Samsung Galaxy A5 2016 is priced at Rs. 48,490 is Nepal  Galaxy A5 comes with some astounding set of specs like the 5.2-inch FullHD super AMOLED screen, unibody metal build and Gorilla Glass 4 panel on both front and back — which makes it no less than that of Samsung flagships. Moreover, its aesthetics is very similar to that of the Galaxy S6, so if you’re looking for a cheaper version of Galaxy S6 this can be the phone for you.  Galaxy A5 sports a fingerprint sensor which is similar to that seen in Note 5 and the Galaxy S6. Also, we have other useful Samsung features like double-tap on the home button to launch the camera app, Samsung theme store, dual window mode etc. Also, the A5 comes equipped with a really capable camera, the camera on the back is 13MP with features like Optical Image Stabilization and pro mode if you want to play more with the camera. The front camera comes with 5MP sensor. Both the front and back camera has f1.9 aperture.        Specifications:   5.2 inches(1080 x 1920 pixels) at 424ppi  Corning Gorilla Glass 4 at both Front and Back  Android 5.1.1 Lollipop  Exynos 7580 Chipset  Octa-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU  Mali-T720MP2 GPU  16 GB Internal Storage, expandable up to\xa0128GB  2GB RAM  13 MP Rear Camera with f/1.9 aperture and Optical Image Stabilization  5MP Front Facing Camera with f/1.9 aperture  Fingerprint Scanner  Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery   Samsung Galaxy A7 2016:  Samsung Galaxy A7 2016 is priced at Rs. 55,490 is Nepal  Samsung Galaxy A7 is just the blown up version of the A5 but comes with bigger battery and RAM to name a few. Galaxy A7 comes with 5.5-inch FullHD super AMOLED screen, unibody metal construction,  Gorilla Glass 4  on both back and front. Overall, it’s almost similar to the A5 if it wasn’t for the size, it has the same fingerprint sensor, same camera module, and the same chipset.  Specifications:   5.5 inches (1080 x 1920 pixels) at 401ppi  Corning Gorilla Glass 4 at both Front and Back  Android 5.1.1 Lollipop  Exynos 7580 Chipset  Octa-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU  Mali-T720MP2 GPU  16 GB Internal Storage, expandable up to\xa0128GB  3GB RAM  13 MP Rear Camera with f/1.9 aperture and Optical Image Stabilization  5MP Front Facing Camera with f/1.9 aperture  Fingerprint Scanner  Non-removable Li-Ion 3300 mAh battery   Verdict:  The first and the very reason you’ll buy the A5 and A7 is for its look, build quality and the screen it offers and despite that, for a normal consumer there might be a lot of compromises with this phone; for example its price. Despite Samsung claiming that the Samsung Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7 2016 Launched in Nepal will to be mid-range, the phone’s cost will be above average to what we Nepalese customers are used to. But taking into consideration of all the specs, it might be feasible to have that price tag, but there are still other better options like the  Nexus 5X ,  OnePlus Two  and even the  Galaxy S5  for what it offers. Also as a phone that is released on 2016, both of these phones run on 5.1.1 lollipop, this is where people cringe over Samsung phones. Although Samsung has promised the Marshmallow update, it is a long way till we get it.  And if you’re wondering what else you could be missing on such an expensive phone, let me remind you there’s no LED notification. So, you never know if you have a new notification and you have to unlock your phone every time to check for notifications. Also, the phone is running on last year’s mid-range chipset Exynos 7580 which is only a very decent performer but results in a great battery life. Overall, if you want an average performing phone with a great AMOLED screen, flagship build and a sturdy design this might be the phone for you.  The Samsung Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7 2016 Launched here in Nepal are priced at  Rs.48,490  and  Rs.55,490  respectively. The Galaxy A5, Galaxy A7 will be available in the Nepali Market starting this Week.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/A5-and-A7.png']
['7 Reasons to buy Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge in Nepal'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['March 21, 2016']",2016-03-21 02:15:34+00:00,"['Galaxy S7 edge has been crowned as the number one smartphone of 2016 or at least for the time being. S7 Edge manages a very precise balance between aesthetic and performance. It has now a lot of improvements compared to edge models of last year; especially the size. Both the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were  launched in Nepal last week , despite being a great phone many people might have their doubts about why they should buy this phone. Samsung has already announced that it is now available for customers to wanting to buy Samsung Galaxy S7 in Nepali Market.  Seven reasons to buy Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge  1. The Edge Display:  Believe it or not, the edge display on a phone is one of the most pleasing things you can see today. While using the device it gives you a kind of immersive experience where icons and other stuff just flows through the edges of the display giving a really natural vibe to it. It is also really helpful to launch to quick contacts, quick settings, and other important apps without bothering to turn on the actual display of the phone.         2. Super AMOLED Screen:  Galaxy S7 Edge now sports a rather bigger display of 5.5-inch\xa0(1440 x 2560) with the pixel density of 534ppi, which is way more than our eyes can tell. Samsung has a streak of making the best displays on their flagship phone and the AMOLED display on the S7 Edge is no different. The viewing angles are great, colors are really sharp, outdoor visibility is good as well, also the VR experience using this phone is really awesome.    3. Water Resistant:  S7 Edge is now IP68 dust and water resistance which makes it one of the sturdiest flagship phone. Not to mention its glass and metal body provides additional protection. We have seen the phone withstand underwater for a really long time without any issues. It’s a great addition if you’re used to handling your phone roughly. For people looking for water resistant high-end smartphones, it can be a good recommendation to buy Samsung Galaxy S7 or even the Edge Variant.   4. Camera  The camera of both the S7 and S7 edge has been titled as the best camera on any smartphone. It has one of the fastest and most accurate camera sensors and with f1.7 aperture S7 edge can capture good quality pictures even in low light. Also, the larger pixels of 12MP rear camera captures a lot of details. S7 Edge also has one of the fastest autofocus seen on any smartphone. It is also capable of shooting 4K videos with optical image stabilization. Double-tap on the home button to launch the camera app is a very neat feature which makes taking pictures instantly a joy. Talking about the Front Facing camera, the 5MP camera also has f1.7 aperture along with wide angle lens where you can fit a lot of objects or people to the canvas and does an excellent job of capturing high details like the rear camera.   5. Expandable Storage:  S7 Edge brings back the Micro SD support which is a huge deal as many of the users have complained about storage on the previous galaxy flagships. Now you have the support of expandable storage up to 200GB where you can store a lot of high-quality pictures and videos taken from the stunning camera. Also, since the internal storage has some room to breathe, you’ll see some slight improvement in the performance as well.   6. Battery Life and Wireless Fast Charging:  One of the best reason for me to Buy Samsung Galaxy S7 or the Edge Variant would be the Battery Life and its charging system. Battery life has always been an issue with a flagship phone as the phone has to handle powerful processors and background apps for fluid user experience. S7 Edge now comes with a bigger battery than before and also few added optimizations on TouchWiz which provides plenty of screens ON time for a normal user. And even if you manage to drain all of the 3600mAh battery with heavy usage, you have the option to fast charge your phone with either standard charger or a wireless charger with Quick Charge 2.0 which charges your phone from 0 to 60% at mere 30mins.   7. Lighter TouchWiz:  TouchWiz has been one of the most resource hogging UI of all time, there were always a lot of unnecessary apps and services running in the background which made the phone sluggish and battery life inefficient. TouchWiz now has a facelift where a lot of unnecessary services has been removed which has significantly improved the overall performance, multitasking and battery life of the phone. But we still have few helpful options like the Always ON Display, Multi Screen, SHealth, Theme Store etc. TouchWiz is now lighter in terms of both looks and weight making the device a pleasure to use.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/samsung-galaxy-s7-6.jpg']

Vernee Apollo seems like a very strong contender for early 2016 as it packs all the latest and greatest specs.

The current version of Mi4 has 16GB inbuilt storage and does not support microSD card for storage expansion.\xa0The phone is available for purchase from eCommerce website  Kaymu .  The Xiaomi Mi4 is a 2 years old flagship, however, it still comes with superior hardware specs. The phone sports a 5-inch Full HD IPS display based on one glass solution (OGS) and is protected by Gorilla Glass 3. It is powered by a 2.5 GHz Quadcore Snapdragon 801 Chipset with Adreno 330 GPU and has 3GB of DDR3 RAM.\xa0The phone has a 13MP Sony IMX214 BSI back camera with LED flash, 6-element lens, f/1.8 aperture, and 4K video recording.

['Moto X Style Review: That’s my Daily Driver'],"['Motorola', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['March 14, 2016']",2016-03-14 07:21:55+00:00,"['2015 has been the year of flagship smartphones on a cheaper price tag, and what I have learned from MWC it’s that the midrange phones are going to be even more interesting in 2016.\xa0Lenovo-owned Motorola is trying to do the same with its latest flagship Moto X Style. It features some astounding specs at a starting price of US$300. I have been using this phone for better part of 4 months as my daily driver, so without further ado let’s find out if the phone holds out to be one of the best midrange flagships in this review.  BUY THE MOTO X STYLE NOW FOR 25% OFF:   Moto X Pure Edition Unlocked Smartphone, 16GB Black (U.S. Warranty – XT1575)  BUILD:        First thing first, it’s in the design where the midrange phones have improved a lot over the years. Moto X Style, despite having a huge 5.7-inch display, feels right in the hand. It doesn’t feel heavy and uncomfortable to hold. It has a metallic frame which makes the phone feel premium. We have got a rubberized back that doesn’t feel cheap by any means. The best thing about Motorola is, with the help of Moto maker, you will be able to customize the phone and make truly yours. I bought it from eBay so I was not able to customize it, however if you want to customize the back and make it dashing, then you should buy the phone from Motorola.com   Let’s talk about its physical overview: On the right side, we have a volume and power buttons that are tactile and super responsive. There is nothing on the left side. On the top, we have got a 3.5mm headphone jack and an SIM card and microSD card tray. Down below is a micro USB port for charging and data syncing.        1  of 5                                                                    On the front, there is a 5.7-inch display, dual front firing speakers, a 5MP selfie camera with LED flash. There are 4 sensors for moto display which I will take about later in this video. The back is non-removable. There is a 21MP sony camera with LED flash. Below it is a Motorola dimple which is not just a gimmicky but works as a place to hold your finger.  DISPLAY:  The first and the second-gen Moto X along with the last years Nexus 6 all featured an AMOLED panel, but this time, Motorola has opted for an LCD display. I have no problem with the LCD panel. It’s a 5.7 inch Quad HD display with accurate color reproduction and viewing angles. But, AMOLED display would have made sense because of Moto display feature. With Moto display, you can just wave your hand and get the notifications if there is any. This is possible because of the 4 sensors located on the front. But with LCD display, the whole screen has to lighten up. With AMOLED display, it would have saved some battery because AMOLED display doesn’t have to produce black colors. Although the display is not as good as the Note 5, it is still a good display you can find in a smartphone.   SOFTWARE:   As far as the software in the Motorola phones goes, it’s basically the pure stock android with some useful apps like moto display, moto assist, moto voice, and moto actions. It’s running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow right now.   With moto voice, you can make your own phrase and use it to perform a different task.  With moto actions, you can twist your phone for quick camera capture, double karate chop to open torch or lift your phone to ear for the discrete reply.  With moto assist, the phone performs a certain task like silent your phone during meetings, read your SMS when you are driving etc.    For me, Software is the best part of any Motorola phones. They don’t have lots of bloat wares and have in build software features and they get updates regularly and faster than Samsung and LG flagships.  PERFORMANCE:   The Moto X has opted for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 808 rather than the flagship chipset 810. But I think it’s a wise move. The 808 is much better behaved than the toasty 810. We have seen the 808 chip in the LG G4 as well as recently launched Nexus 5x. The phone includes 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM, NFC for use with contactless payment services like Android Pay, a Quick Charge 2.0-compatible fast charging technology called Turbo Power, 866Mbps 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, and an LTE modem and transceiver setup. However, the phone is deprived of wireless charging and a fingerprint sensor.   The Snapdragon 808 combines four “little” 1.4GHz ARM Cortex A53 CPU cores with two “big” 1.8GHz Cortex A57 CPU cores, all of which can be used at once if the situation warrants. The big cores are generally used for high-performance tasks while the little ones are used for the heavy lifting. The performance is smooth and didn’t lag once. The multitasking is a breeze and playing high-end games at highest settings worked really well.\xa0 Although, it’s not as fast as the Exynos 7420 of recent Samsung phones, but both CPU and GPU are more than capable of handling whatever you throw at it.  CAMERA: The last two generations of the Moto X, and the Motorola-made Nexus 6, have had some of the worst performing camera sensors for a flagship phone. I’m glad that with the Moto X Style, Motorola has finally made camera performance a priority.  It sports a 21-megapixel rear-facing camera with a f/2.0 lens. It quickly snaps photos in plenty of light, though it’s a bit slower in lower light settings. The Moto X performed fine in with lots of details in good light condition, but outside at night and in darker rooms, it performed just average. The 4K video recording is great for a phone without Optical image stabilization. As far as the front 5MP is concerned, it’s good for selfie lovers with wide angle lens and astonishing picture quality. However, I am not sure about the flash on the front.  AUDIO: The front firing speakers make a lot of sense and I can’t understand why other smartphone doesn’t have it. It makes for a much better listening as well as while playing games. It’s loud and crisp and is as good as HTC’s boom sound.  BATTERY:  With a high-resolution screen and fast chips, the new Moto X’s battery life isn’t particularly great. It can give you one full day of moderate usage, but will not last long if you are on a heavy usage. However, the fast charging feature will help you a lot in this scenario. It can charge from 0 to 100% in as little as 1 hour and 10 mins and you are good to go. It has around 4 hours of screen time and 8 hours of video playback. I expected, with marshmallow update, the battery performance would improve slightly with android’s new doze mode, but it hasn’t for some reason.  VERDICT:  So, as for the verdict, Moto X Style represents a great value for the money. At $300, it is substantially cheaper than other phones in its category. It comes with Good specs and great build quality and with Moto Maker customization it gives the phone some distinctiveness that competitors don’t have. It has expandable storage upto 128GB which is a rare feature to find in a smartphone these days. It runs on nearly stock android and will get updates earlier than other high-end flagships.  However, on the downside, it lacks Fingerprint sensor, the chipset is not the fastest we have seen, it has mediocre low light camera performance and battery life is just okay. Despite this handful of drawbacks, I believe its one of the best value for flagship smartphone out there.

This attempt aims to stop the illegal trade of mobile phones especially buying and selling the mobile phones that have been stolen. Moreover, the network provider such as NTC and Ncell will have the ability to block calls and internet services if the phone is registered as “ Stolen “  Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Information and Communication Technology has collaborated to start a mobile phone tracking system. Mobile phones will be tracked through their IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number which is different for different mobile phones.  Nepal telecom is said to start this system from the upcoming Baisakh 1. Ncell and UTL are said to start this system immediately as they have the required equipment for the mobile phone tracking but since Nepal telecom doesn’t have the equipment it will start this system within 6 months.         This is actually a great initiative from the government since the lost mobile phone can now be recovered from this system and the illegal trade of mobile phones will be hopefully stopped. Customers will surely benefit from this system as they will get the genuine mobile phone since the legal trade of mobile phones will be encouraged by this system.  How to Track Your Lost or Stolen Android Phone  First and foremost thing after buying a smartphone is to write down the\xa0 IMEI number  of your phone. Every smartphone has a unique IMEI number (International Mobile Equipment Identity Number). A dual SIM phone will have 2 IMEI number. It will also be printed on the back of your device’s packaging. If you are unable to find the number, you just have to launch your phone dialer and dial the number  *#06# . This will give you the IMEI number of your phone. Store this number in a safe place so that it helps you in locating your phone when it is lost. Another way of finding an IMEI number is by logging into  google dashboard account.    If your phone gets lost, you can  file a Police complaint\xa0 by visiting the\xa0Regional Police Unit Office (Hanuman Dhoka, Teku for Kathmandu Valley users).\xa0You have to provide IMEI number of your phone while filing a police complaint upon which your phone will be registered as “ Stolen “. Your service provider (NTC/NCell/UTL) uses your IMEI number to track your phone. Also, make sure that you block the SIM card that was being used in the handset.

It’s a do or die situation for HTC since the competition in the smartphone business is unreal. However, recent rumors and leaked images provide us with a hint that it’s going to be riveting.  With LG G5 and Samsung Galaxy S7 already being launched at MWC, we expect HTC to launch the successor of HTC one M9, the HTC one M10 or HTC 10, as early as the first week of April. To begin with,  Evan Blass  reveals the phone images for the first time.  Apart from the leaked image, Onleaks revealed the prototype specs for the HTC 10 which goes as:         5.15-inch QHD AMOLED Display  Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 SoC  Adreno 530 graphic  4GB of LPDDR4 RAM  32GB internal storage with microSD expansion slot  12 MP Ultrapixel camera with laser-assisted autofocus  Front facing camera with Optical Image Stabilization  No Dual Front firing Speakers since there is a home button with Fingerprint sensor  USB Type-C port  Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with HTC sense 8.0 UI    In the past years, HTC’s camera has not been their greatest strength, but the Taiwan-based company says that the phone will have a very, very compelling camera experience.

So, girls, be ready for this geeky ride!\xa0To start things up, as a warm-up, do watch this video:         1. WE ALL ADMIT, GIRLS ADD BEAUTY!  While being geek and focused all the way to the gadget and tech en vironment, we guys tend to overlook the simple phenomenon that the world stands on “beauty”. Yes, If there were girl-geeks they would create and add “vibrant beauty” to the more or less\xa0 non-beautified\xa0 platform. With changes in the designs  2. BEAUTY WITH BRAINS IS NOT THAT BAD ANYWAY!  It won’t kill girls to know a little bit more about technology and gadgets. Since girls tend to have a desire for fashion and trend, it will be a perfect match since gadgets are trendy, changing &, in fact, a fashion statement these days! Since you already carry some sort of gadgets with you, knowing about them would make a perfect sense.  Photo Credits: Colors Mobile Nepal Instagram  3. YOU CAN FIX THINGS,\xa0 YOURSELF!  Remember the last time you asked somebody else, your boyfriend, brother or anybody to fix things and saw their sick, tired faces? Well, that will be gone with you knowing things all by yourself! You won’t have to call him to tell that your laptop needs formatting. You don’t have to ask him every time how to fix your smartphone. You don’t have to even waste your money calling on somebody to fix petty things for you, that will help you buy a new tee, right!

BECAUSE THERE ARE FEW:  Of Course, I agree to put this at last because, agree to disagree, there are not many girls into tech which makes me sad. Come on, girls, why not! Also, if you start right off you always have that initial advantage. And since many girls abroad have already begun taking interest in the tech, it’s a high-time that girls in Nepal start in this field!

However, there are few pros and cons you should know before considering buying it.  4\xa0REASONS TO BUY:   FINGER PRINT SENSOR: \xa0  Although fingerprint scanner has been common these days even in midrange phones, but the fingerprint sensor on the Huawei GR5 is something to talk about. It is one of the best fingerprint scanners you can find in a smartphone. It’s fast and super responsive and unlocks your phone in just 0.5 secs. Furthermore, the scanner here does tasks such as accepting calls, silence the alarm, show/clear notifications and taking photos.   FULL METAL BODY:  The Huawei GR5 sports a metal body, which is a rare feature on a midrange phone. The phone feels premium in the hands, although it is not light weight and compact.   DECENT 1080P DISPLAY:  A 5.5-inch 1080P display on the Huawei GR5 offers good color reproduction and a bright panel. The only thing I didn’t like about the display is it lacks gorilla glass protection and is prone to scratches.   GREAT BATTERY LIFE:  With a big 3000mAh battery and lots of battery saving feature, the battery life on the Huawei GR5 is a beast. It will last for a day under heavy usage, and will endure for almost two days under normal usage.    3 REASONS TO NOT BUY: \xa0   IFFY PERFORMANCE: \xa0On papers, the Qualcomm Octacore 616 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM might sound great, but in real world usage, it is just mediocre. Having said that, it is a good phone for\xa0everyday tasks. However, I noticed lags while playing games or even multitasking. It also tends to heat up quite frequently. The Emotion UI on the Huawei GR5 is laggy at times and consumes more RAM than a stock version. We hope to see Marshmallow update soon which might help the phone with better software optimization.  \xa0AVERAGE CAMERA:  The 13MP back camera of the shoots photos in 4:3 ratio\xa0with a resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels. The photos, even in good lighting conditions, were washed out with a fair amount of digital noise. Dynamic range is not that great too, with HDR mode not making a significant impact for a phone with 5 element lens and\xa0blue glass infrared filter.\xa0Even for video, the camera performance is mediocre.   INFLATED PRICING : The Huawei GR5 is priced at Rs.34,000 which is utterly absurd considering its identical twin Huawei Honor 5x is priced at $199 (approx Rs.21,500) in the US and \xa0INR 13,000 (approx Rs. 20,800) in India. I simply can’t understand why Huawei smartphones in Nepal are highly priced in Nepal. The only reason I can think of is they don’t have any competitors in the market. Had their been Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, Le Eco 1s, and Lenovo K4 note to compete, I would have been writing a different story.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Huawei-GR5-2.jpg']

So today we will point out the pros and cons of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 which will help u decide if the phone is right for you or not.  Pros of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3   Full Metal Body:   The redmi note is very well designed with full metal body. The metal gives the phone a sturdy and premium look. The looks of the phone is similar to its predecessor redmi note 2 but the material in note 3 is aluminum metal. It’s certainly great to see Xiaomi bringing full metal body design to its midrange device.          Fingerprint scanner:   Fingerprint scanner has become a must for most people. We can see many devices having it and Xiaomi offering this feature in redmi note 3 will certainly attract people towards it. The fingerprint scanner here is located at the back and is quick and responsive; the scanner unlocks the phone in 0.3 seconds.    Battery:   Redmi note 3 has a huge 4,000mah battery. So with such large battery, the battery life of the phone is great. Some tests suggest that the note 3 offers around 264 hours of talk time over the 3G network. Redmi note 3 will last you one day and a half with good usage.   Processor:   Xiaomi has opted for 64-bit MediaTek helio x10 processor clocked at 2gHz. There are two variants of this phone one with 2gb ram with 16gb of storage and another 3gb ram with 32gb of storage. The helio x10 is a great performer inside such an affordable phone and the chipset can handle all tasks on redmi note 3’s 1080p screen.   Camera:   Redmi note 3 features a13MP rear camera with dual tone flash and a 5MP front camera. The rear camera has a hybrid autofocus system that helps in faster and more accurate focus. The picture taken is of good quality although not comparable to the likes of flagships. Nonetheless, the picture and video quality is great for a midrange device.   Cons of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3   No microSD slots:   With only 16gb and 32gb of storage to choose from some people will be disappointed, as people wouldn’t be able to expand the storage with an external microSD card.   Average 1080P display with No scratch resistant screen:   The 1080 display here is an average unit. The contrast ratio, color accuracy as well as the sunlight legibility is average. Moreover, the screen is not scratch resistant as it doesn’t have gorilla glass or dragon trail glass. So if you are not careful with it, the screen can get scratch easily.   All in all, despite having some few cons, it is still one of the best phones to buy for $200 and we totally recommend you to go for it as it has a nice metal design, a big screen, fast CPU and a decent camera.

Despite packing some great features, the phone has some downsides to it too. So, here are the 5 pros and 2 cons of the Lenovo K4 Note.  PROS OF LENOVO K4 NOTE  1. Display:  The K4 Note has a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display with a 1080 x 1920 pixels resolution and 403ppi pixel density. Apart from being a full HD display, the K4 Note screen offers good brightness and contrast. The K4 Note display comes with Gorilla Glass 3 protection and is scratch resistant. The display is quite bright and is easily visible in the outdoors during the daytime. Since the phone is mid-ranged, having a 1080p screen sounds good for the price.         2. Audio:  The Lenovo K4 Note also comes equipped with two front-facing speakers alongside Dolby Atmos audio system. I believe due to the stereo speakers, the phone offers a significantly better and louder sound output. The front facing speakers are great when watching movies, playing games or even listening to some music. It’s nice to see Lenovo bring this feature to an affordable smartphone like the Vibe K4 Note.  3. Battery:  The Lenovo K4 Note boasts of a large non-removable 3300mAH battery. The battery should easily last you one full working day. It has around 5hrs to 7hrs of the screen on time. K4 note charges from 0 to 100% in about 2 hours 15 minutes. With a 1080p display and average processor, the k4 note provides good battery life.  4. Fingerprint scanner:  It’s nice to see Lenovo throwing in a fingerprint scanner into the mix which is fast becoming an industry standard. The scanner is quick and responsive. Apart from being a security feature in a phone, the scanner can also act as a shortcut for the home button.   5. Price:  The smartphone is bang for the buck and you will definitely enjoy the positive features of the smartphone. Only at around $199 you get a phone with good looks, metallic frame, front facing speakers and fingerprint scanner. The phone comes with good specs for a mid range phone. Overall, I think that getting those good features at such an affordable price is a good deal.  CONS OF LENOVO K4 NOTE:  1. Processor:  Lenovo has decided to go for the 64-bit MediaTek MT6753 octa-core processor clocked at 1.3GHz and it is combined with the GPU Mali –T720. The processor is coupled with 3GB RAM. While the 3GB RAM is very well enough for day-to-day usage and multitasking, but high-end games such as Asphalt 8, modern combat lags. So if you like playing games with good graphics this phone is not for you but if you don’t then the processor can easily handle simple tasks thrown at it.   2. Heating problem:  The phone may not heat up that frequently but you will definitely feel the phone getting warmer during playing games and multitasking. The phone feels slightly warm on the back with normal usage but it is not a major problem. Also, while using 3g the phone gets warmer.']",[]

Despite that, the growth of mobile phone user is increasing day by day. Mobile phones have become more advanced that almost every work that was only done on desktop or laptop is now done on them. It has become an integral part of many people’s life. The radiations of mobile phones are said to be strong enough to damage soft tissue but weak to alter the DNA.  Low count of sperm in men is a problem which is on a rise these days. Various scientific research suggests that men who put their mobile phones in their trouser’s pocket are likely to have lower sperm count than those who don’t. Experts are warning men to decrease the use of the phone as it is associated with “cooking sperm” and causing lower sperm count which will affect while a couple tries to conceive a baby.         Whereas there are no any published studies about the effects of mobile phone radiation on women’s reproductive health. The study by specialists suggests that men who keep their phone in their pocket are seriously affected in 47% cases compared to 11% in general population.  The risk of eye vision problem is also associated with the use of mobile phones. It is said that due to smaller displays in mobile phones you are squinting and likely straining your eyes while using them which decreases the vision. So it’s best to use them as little as possible or prefer larger displays for doing many tasks.   The brain activity is also likely affected due to mobile phones. A scientific study concluded that acute cell phone exposure affects the brain’s metabolic activity however the study didn’t say anything about possible carcinogenic effects of the mobile phone. The electromagnetic interference can also can mobile phones to interfere with the operation of pacemakers and some hearing aids while the interference is said to be reduced on 3G and newer systems.   The electromagnetic interference can also can mobile phones to interfere with the operation of pacemakers and some hearing aids while the interference is said to be reduced on 3G and newer systems. Since mobile phone cannot be completely avoided to be safe from all of its adverse effects, what we can do from our side is to lower the use of them and look for their alternatives.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Colors-K3-connectivity.jpg']

As for comparison, the Xiaomi Mi5 is half of the price of many flagship devices. Here are the five features that you should know about the Mi5:  1. Hardware Specs  The Xiaomi Mi5 sports a 5.15-inch Full HD display with curved 3D ceramic display, ultra-thin bezels, and low power consuming LED lights that is ultra bright with 600 nits of brightness, yet power efficient. The screen offers a technology called Sunlight Display that helps to adjust contrast for each pixel in real time for better screen clarity under harsh light.         In terms of hardware, the Xiaomi Mi5 is powered by the latest Snapdragon 820 CPU– the latest processor from the Qualcomm which is also powering other handsets such as  LG G5  and  Galaxy S7 , coupled with 3/4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. According to the company, the Snapdragon 820 CPU is twice as fast, and 50% more power efficient than last years Snapdragon 810 CPU. Also, the Adreno 530 GPU that’s embedded inside the SD 820 will offer 40% increase in graphics than the SD 810. For the first time, Xiaomi has also opted for UFS 2.0 storage option instead of traditional eMMC 5.0, resulting in 87% faster data transmission.   2. Camera  16 MP camera f2.0 might not sound much but what it packs is a 4 axis stabilization which makes sure that the photo/video you take will be blur free. Xiaomi has tried to demonstrate on a video about the capability of their new Mi 5’s camera by comparing with the rival  iPhone 6s and 6s plus camera .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izIY88iAMbc  3. Design & Built  The design of Mi 5 is elegant to look at. It’s 7.3mm thin which might not be the thinnest still the curved edges on the back should make it pretty easy to handle. it weighs at just 129g which is very impressive comparing with an iPhone 6s weighing 143g and iPhone 6s plus weighing at 192g and Samsung S7 weighing at 152g.   4.

['CAT S60 announced with thermal camera and strong build'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['February 25, 2016']",2016-02-25 16:10:17+00:00,"['CAT, a company that produces huge machines mainly\xa0for construction works and other heavy works, has developed a phone with a rigid and sturdy build, as expected from such a company, which has an integrated FLIR thermal camera. Running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the CAT S60 offers other feature like water resistant and the ability to withstand a few drops.  The built of the phone is purely rugged and bulky. The S60 has strengthened die cast metal frame and carbon fiber look-alike toughened plastic on the rear. According to the manufacturers, the handset can hold out against drops onto concrete from up to 1.8 meters. In addition to that, the phone is dust-proof and waterproof. The S60 can be used up to 5m of depth underwater for an hour with all of the switches closed for speakers and microphones. Without the switches closed, the phone can only withstand 2m of depth underwater.  FLIR Thermal Camera  Well, we have already seen add-on thermal camera modules for iPhones and Android but this is the first phone that has FLIR thermal camera built in. so, there are basically two rear cameras; one normal 13MP camera and the other very special thermal camera. The thermal camera records the heat data and with the help of the app, a simple tap on the screen gives the approximate temperature of the object.        Looking at the physique and features of the C60, it looks like it’s made to be used by a construction worker, plumber, electrician or someone who has to work under harsh environment. Normal users would like to stay away from its midrange processor and its bulky built. The physical aspect isn’t that appealing as well. But the dustproof and waterproof feature would certainly attract people who have to work around lakes, ponds, or places where there are too much of dust. The phone’s thermal camera could certainly be a plus point for an electrician to find the heat dissipation in circuits and other circuit elements. Also, people who work with fires like in factories, and people who constantly need to check the temperature of certain objects and machines can benefit from the thermal camera on this phone for easy measurement and convenience. The camera can see through smoke with the help of its thermal sensors, and this can be useful for a person who needs to deal with smoke in their work or for any case of that matter. And this can be used in search and rescue missions where bodies might be hidden by smoke. Again, the thermal camera would not be that much beneficial for normal users but they certainly can win the bragging rights among friends by showing off the awesome feature.  Other specs of the phone include:   4.7-inch 720p display with wet finger and glove support  Screen is shielded with 1mm gorilla glass 4  13MP main camera with dual-LED flash and 5MP front-facing camera  Snapdragon 617 octacore processor (1.5 GHz) coupled with Adreno 405  3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, expandable using microSD  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4G LTE connectivity  Large battery of 3,800mAh capacity   CAT S60  So, CAT S60 was announced at MWC 2016 and it will be made available later this year for $599 in the U.S. People might be overwhelmed with the pricing for the smartphone with such midrange specs but keep in mind, it features the ruggedness from CAT and a built in FLIR thermal camera.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hgkmsq2csijahsaeebem.jpg']

It is safe to say that CG has got a fair market share on mid-range smartphones with decent performing hardware at a reasonable price.  No doubt CG smartphones are one of the most good looking phones in its price category. They feel great on hand and, for the most part, doesn’t feel cheap. Now, CG has introduced yet another mid-range phone to their EON line up, CG EON Edge for Rs.11,999.  What’s inside CG EON Edge?  Don’t get fooled by the name. By no means, this phone has a curved edge display like the Samsung Galaxy Edge series. Instead, it is rocking a 5 inch 720p IPS display with the resolution of 720*1280. It is powered by 1.3GHz processor (Unspecified) backed up by 2GB of RAM. EON Edge comes with 16GB Internal storage with the option to expand via Micro SD card up to 32GB. As far as the camera is concerned it has 13MP Rear Camera with auto focus and 5MP Front-facing Camera. The device being launched in 2016 still runs on Android Lollipop 5.1 with no signs of future updates. Powering this device is a 2000mAh battery which should give a decent battery backup keeping account of the hardware configuration. The only turn off for this phone can be its single SIM capability as most of the mid-range phones come with the\xa0option of dual SIM.        To conclude, CG EON Edge doesn’t bring anything new to the table. It has the same hardware configuration like the Moto E, Gionee P5W, Huawei Honor Holly, Colors Elite E10 and almost all smartphones at its price range.

Availability and Price of\xa0Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge in Nepal  Even though Samsung has not announced the official price of the two new launches, it can be estimated that the S7 will cost around $750 in US and $100 more for the Edge variant. The possibility of the launch of the two smartphones is Nepal is high since we have authorized distributors of Samsung Mobiles. Even though the Galaxy S6 was not a huge success, Samsung Nepal will try to release the product as soon as possible. Looking at the trend, it can be estimated other retailers and emerging eCommerce website will bring it earlier than the official Launch from Samsung Nepal (IMS). The Price will be slightly higher than the original price. The price\xa0can be predicted to cost you NRs. 95,000.']",[]

The LG G5 sports a full metal body,\xa0but still manages to have a removable battery thanks to its modular design. The LG G5 is\xa0 priced at Rs. 85,000 \xa0in Nepal.  What’s Inside LG G5?  The LG G5 sports a 5.3-inch Quad HD IPS quantum display with 900 nits of brightness and is protected by gorilla glass 4 protection. Considering normal user checks a phone 150 times a day, LG has introduced an Always-On Display that lights up part of the screen at all times. According to LG, the battery consumption is significantly lower at 0.8% per hour.         The phone is powered by Qualcomm’s latest SoC, the Snapdragon 820, that the company promises is twice as faster and battery efficient as compared \xa0to Snapdragon 810. In terms of memory, the LG G5 has 4GB of LRDDR4 RAM and 32GB ROM that can be further upgraded with microSD card upto 2TB.   Talking about the back camera, LG has two cameras on the back–a regular 16-megapixel imager and a 135-degree wide angle 8-megapixel camera. Both these cameras can be used individually while the later is used for wide angle photos.   The LG G5 has 2800 mAh battery with quick charge 3.0 (charge from 0% to 80% in just 35 minute) and USB type C for charging and data syncing. What’s amazing about the battery, is it’s removable, despite featuring a full metal body. On the side of the phone, there is a small key that opens its lower part giving us access to the battery, a process much similar to loading a gun. You can also insert a\xa0modular device, named LG CAM+, which turns the camera of the phone into a digital camera. The LG CAM+ offers dedicated shutter button, zoom in/out button, and sports a 4000mAh battery.   Alongside G CAM+, LG also showcased another modular device called LG Hi-Fi Plus. It is a high-end external 32-bit DAC and amplifier, build in collaboration with Bang & Olufsen Play. The LG Hi-Fi Plus offers premium sound quality and is portable in nature.   The LG G5 runs on Android Marshmallow 6.0 with the latest version of its LG UX, which is deprived of the app drawer. LG G5 also offers HD audio codec and Dolby digital plus sound for superior audio from the built-in rear speaker. The LG G5 comes in 4 different colors: Silver, Gold, Pink, and Titan. While the pricing and availability have not been confirmed yet, we can take a guess it’s gonna be available at the start of March for a price around US$650.']",[]

Nokia, one of the leading research companies in 5G technology, demonstrated the 5G speed of 30 Gb/s. For starters, that’s thousand times faster than the current 4G connection. With such speed, Nokia forecasts that 5G will have some interesting capabilities in the future. Here are the 5 crazy things 5G will be able to do in the future:   Driverless car:  The major problem existing right now with the self-driving cars is that the current wireless technology has a higher rate of Latency (time taken by a packet of data to get from one designated point to another). If there is high latency, there will be a lag between the car’s sensor and the data centre sending data’s to the car.   Since 5G\xa0cellular technology uses the spectrum above 6GHz, it offers\xa0offer ‘virtually zero’ latency. This leads to self-driving cars being more reliable and the case for accidents and crash will be very rare.  Virtual Reality:  5G will provide a new era for online video gamers. When you put on a virtual reality machine on your head, you will be able to enjoy a virtual world by interacting with the games, different scenes, etc. However, with the help of 5G, you will be able to send remote commands in real time without noticeable latency, making Virtual Reality look like a real life experience.  Immersive UHD Multimedia Experience If you are a sports fan, you will definitely love this one. Just imagine watching your favorite team play in real-time on your TV. With 5G’s ridiculous fast speed, you will be able to watch real-time goals, tackles, passes from various angles, and get the most out of the game.\xa0Other interesting service scenarios include interactive 360° movies, online games, remote education, and live concerts.  Smart Homes With the capabilities of 5G system design, it will provide support for up to a million simultaneous connections enabling\xa0all your home appliances and devices to communicate with each other autonomously. Examples include a smart fire extinguisher that alerts your neighbouring home in case of emergency, a\xa0smart refrigerator that recommends a recipe to be cooked with ingredients that are already in your refrigerator and considering a number of calories your body needs, thanks to a smart watch that is constantly monitoring your energy level in your body.  Rise of the Robots  With 5G’s low latency and high speed, it will immensely allow wireless robots to perform complicated tasks that you have never heard of. The Internet of Things lets masts(towers) connect with thousands of sensors and machines with which Robots can be used in various applications like robotic surgical tools, surveillance drones, etc']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5G-nepal.jpg']

"['Samsung Galaxy S7 Price, Rumors roundup']",['Samsung'],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['February 17, 2016']",2016-02-17 04:46:13+00:00,"['Today, Samsung will unveil its Galaxy S7, the seventh phone of the galaxy S series line. Samsung will launch the phone at its ‘unpacked’ event today, February 21 st , at 11:45 p.m. local time. Like we have seen in the past with Galaxy S6, we know that the flagship will be launched alongside the S7 Edge that has a curved display.\xa0So here’s what has been buzzing around about the Samsung Galaxy S7:  Design| Samsung\xa0Galaxy S7  We would not expect any drastic changes in the design of the S7 as the S6 was a total redesign from the past galaxy s phones. Samsung has really taken the time to make the designs of their flagships more premium than ever, with metal and glass body.        From the recently leaked renders, we can see that the design of S7 and S7 Edge is not that far from S6, which isn’t a bad thing at all.\xa0Another leaked picture shows the back of the phone and again it doesn’t differ from the S6 series. The back looks more curved and it seems that there is no bump for the camera like in the S6 series.  I should say that the leaked images may be different from the official one. But it provides us with a small glimpse of what is to come from the S7 series.\xa0It looks like Samsung has taken the core design from the S6 and modified the design to look sleeker and more premium.  Specs| Samsung\xa0Galaxy S7  Every flagship from Samsung has the best screen, with the Super AMOLED display and, it won’t be different this time. Both the S7 and S7 Edge most probably will have quad HD resolution like in the S6. What we have also been hearing is that the S7 Edge will have a larger display with 5.5-inch while the regular S7 will be the same 5.1-inch.   Samsung has opted to go for the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. But there will be variation in chipset from phones bought in different regions. It is rumored that the Snapdragon 820 version will be available in U.S. market while other S7 phones in another region will use Samsung’s new Exynos 8 Octa chipsets. Whether its Snapdragon 820 version or the Exynos version, we think that both of them will be equally powerful and there won’t be much difference to compare.  Battery| Samsung\xa0Galaxy S7  The camera, performance, and design everything were great in the S6 except for the battery life; which was really poor. Even though wireless and fast charging was there, it didn’t make up for the battery being so weak.   This time, around Samsung will include a larger 3000mAh battery in the regular S7, which is a good improvement from the S6’s 2550mAh battery. And for the S7 Edge 3600mAh battery will be opted. Like in S6 both of the devices will offer wireless and fast charging.  Camera| Samsung\xa0Galaxy S7  Samsung is the manufacturer of the best cameras in smartphones – the galaxy S6, S6 Edge to the Note 5; all of them take amazing pictures. From low light shots to recording 4k videos, the Samsung phones prove their worth.  We definitely wouldn’t want the camera to change but it is said that Samsung will downgrade the resolution from 16 megapixels to 12 megapixels. But the aperture of the new S7 will be better than the previous and will allow the phone to take even greater looking pictures in low light situations. I don’t think the downgrade of resolution of the camera is concerning as we all know Samsung is best in the camera department.  MicroSD| Samsung\xa0Galaxy S7  We didn’t see micro SD slots in S6 series and Note 5, and many users had a lot to say about it. Finally, Samsung may have listened to their customers and we could see the return of SD card slot in the S7. Some rumors suggest that even if they do not have the separate slot for the SD card, the sim tray may also hold the microSD.  Water Resistant| Samsung\xa0Galaxy S7  The S7 and S7 Edge will offer an IP67 water-resistant design. So the users can use the phone in the rain and they wouldn’t have to worry about the phone if it falls into puddles.   Software UI  The Galaxy S7 has also been featured in a brief hands-on video, revealing the latest version of TouchWiz, layered on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow.   Pricing  It has been rumored that Samsung Galaxy S7 will cost\xa0€699 while theS7 Edge will be available at\xa0€799. Samsung will also be throwing a free Gear VR headset for early birds.  These are all the news and rumors we have heard about the Samsung Galaxy S7 series. Some of these rumors haven’t been made official yet. So, let’s see today if the rumors stand true or not and what Samsung will bring new to the table apart from the stuff we have already heard till now.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/addtext_com_MjMzMzA4MTI2ODE3.png']

The phone is priced at Rs. 80,000 here in Nepal for the 4GB RAM /64GB ROM variant. We played with the handset for some time, and here’s our initial impressions:   First Impression of Huawei Mate 8  Mate 8 has a strong design language with stunning construction, but still manages to feel light while carrying it. Also, we have this smooth metal body which is spitting premium at every touch. Up front, we have this massive 6 Inch 1080p display with the resolution of 368ppi. It seems less compared to the size of the screen, but the display up front looks really amazing. Also, the display is protected with corning gorilla glass 4.                   Despite having a massive form factor, the curved back helps the phone to sit comfortably in the hand. The phone is currently running on Android 6.0 marshmallow with Huawei’s Emotion UI 4.0 on top. The interface is similar to the previous generation’s Huawei phones, but the animations are a lot smoother and the icon design seems flatter this time. You won’t have a hard time coping with this phone if you have used Huawei or other phones with no app drawers in the past.  Talking about the performance, it is one area where you don’t have to compromise anything. Everything just flies off smoothly. This phone is rocking the Huawei’s own in-house chipset, Kirin 915 coupled with 4GB of RAM, which has the highest ANtutu benchmarks score compared to any other android devices today. And also on real life usage the phone doesn’t lags, app opening is fast and the animations are smooth.

Overall Mate 8 feels like a solid phone, Huawei always has worked great on its hardware but the software still feels like it needs a lot more attention.  The camera also looks pretty good, even at low light condition. We will talk about the camera in our full review. Overall, the phone looks solid and should compete against Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and iPhone 6s Plus.

['Colors Pearl Black K3 Full Review: A Good phone with disappointing camera'],"['Colors', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['February 5, 2016']",2016-02-05 07:41:39+00:00,"['Teletalk recently launched their flagship smartphone  Colors Pearl Black K3  for Rs.20,995. The phone comes with a stunning design with Asahi enhanced glass on both sides, a whopping 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but how well the phone performs in real world usage?  Disclaimer:  We’ve been using the phone for almost one month\xa0now, and in this article, we will sum up if the successor of  Pearl Black K2 \xa0 holds to be one of the phones to buy at the aforementioned price.  BOX\xa0CONTENTS   flip-cover  Jelly back cover  SIM ejector tool  Earphones  Wall Charger (5V/1A)  USB to MicroUSB cable  Screen protector  Some booklets, which includes list of all the authorized service center in Nepal, warranty card, and a user guide   DESIGN:  The design is one area where Colors Pearl Black K3 has hit its mark. Its 5-inch form factor has made the device compact and easier to use also being light at the same time. On my day to day usage, I find this phone conventionally comfortable to use. Talking about the overview of the phone, On the front, we have the 5inch 720p IPS panel accompanied by ear piece, an 8MP FF camera on top and capacitive backlit button on the bottom. On the back, we have the 13MP Camera with single tone LED flash and colors branding. On the bottom, there is micro USB port along with a single speaker and microphone. The left side holds sim card slot and on the right, there’s the volume and power button with tactile feedback.        1  of 5                                                                    The curved sides make the phone really easier to hold with the Asahi glass used on the a back doesn’t make this phone as slippery as I thought. However, it’s a fingerprint magnet if you are using a black variant. Overall it’s a really handy phone.        DISPLAY:  The Colors Pearl Black K3 comes with a 5-inch 720p display with a resolution of 294ppi and it’s not the best 720p display for this price range. Colors are on the warmer side even with some improvements in its inbuilt Mira vision app. The whites are actually not white here, you get yellowish tint when you compare with other 720p display like the Moto G 2014. For the most part, the display is okay, you don’t see any pixelation and also the outdoor visibility is quite good. But don’t expect anything that crispy from this display.   SOFTWARE UI:  Colors have now adopted the stock version of android which runs on Android 5.1 lollipop which is a really big improvement in terms of performance and usability aspect. But you do get some gesture controls, call blocking and junk cleaning apps inbuilt which is always good to have. You also get 4 themes to choose from, and apart from the default one, other are really funky and doesn’t fit to my liking.   CAMERA:  The camera UI is simple and has few options like panorama, face beauty and live photo. The 13MP Rear camera is pretty average for a device at this price point. I really wanted to like the camera but I have mixed feelings about it.  At daylight condition, some pictures came out really nice and likable with noticeable dynamic range and saturation while sometimes on the same lighting condition images turn out to be washed out and dark. This happened to me quite a lot so I had to retake a lot of photos to get the right one. And the 1080p video is also not that crisp like you would expect on a full HD resolution but it’s enough to get some normal videos.   Talking about the Front facing camera, it is quite good for taking selfies and group photos but struggles on low lighting conditions. To be honest, I really don’t expect a good camera from Colors anymore as it’s always the same average performing camera on every phone which you have to struggle with to get a good shot.  PERFORMANCE:  Performance is the Colors Pearl Black K3’s forte. This phone is as smooth as it gets. It has the same 1.3ghz Mediatek MT6735 chipset and Mali T720 GPU like on the E20, so there’s not much radical change on the benchmarks, however, the 3GB RAM takes this phone to a whole new level of real life usage.      Colors K3 Benchmark score   1  of 3                                                You get about 1.8 to1.5GB free RAM at any instance and App opening, app switching, playing games and animations work out flawlessly on this phone. Multitasking is no joke here, you can switch between as many apps you want running in the background and they will open right where you left off. (Compare with OnePlus One, app opening and multitasking.) Also, while gaming heat distribution is quite good and you can easily play high-end games without stutters or lag for the most part. Also, the speakers at the bottom won’t give you the best multimedia experience as it easily gets blocked while holding the phone and sound is not that good either.  BATTERY:  Its 2350mAh battery is pretty impressive, you can get a full day of battery on normal usage and the standby time is great as well. But on heavy usage you have to grab a charger to juice it up again. And its 1amp power outlet takes about 2 hours to completely charge it from 0 to 100%.  CONNECTIVITY:  Connectivity bothered me a lot on this phone. My Wi-Fi signal gets lost or disconnected often and I have to reconnect it time and again. Also, while making calls, the call clarity was not that good. I could barely hear the people on other ends. This is mostly because earpiece produces really faint sound. Even with a loudspeaker on, it is difficult to talk on this phone as call clarity is not that good.   VERDICT:  For my final verdict, the\xa0Colors Pearl Black K3 phone has a lot to love and equally a lot to hate as well. It feels good when a phone this cheap performs really well, has no lag, and handles pretty much anything you throw at it. You’ll also love how well this phone is built and how comfortable it is to carry and use, but the price comes into play when you use the godforsaken camera or make calls with this phone. So, for whom is this phone really for?  If you want a cheap phone where you’ll get enough power to play high-end games and get good battery life\xa0 and also if you want a light and compact phone with good design you should probably get this phone. Apart from that, I don’t think this is a good buy at this price point, particularly considering the camera performance. There are other great options like the Canvas 5, Lenovo K3 note.']",[]

It was an overwhelming experience to see all the pretty setups and stalls with people swarming around at every corner. But the Info Tech experience as a whole is getting dull every year. Nothing new is showcased, we see the usual tech stuff we see on the market, it’s just that everything is at one place. But what really drags people towards CAN Info-Tech is the cheap prices of tech stuff offered during the event.  This year the Info Tech is all crowded with ISP providers in the main hall, not to mention Subisu which is standing large and tall at the centre of the event. You could find all the major ISPs of Nepal like Subisu, Otel, Vianet, Classic Tech, WebSurfer and many more. There are many special offers provided by these ISPs during this event which is sort of like the festive offers. As loadshedding hits the country hard, there were a noticeable amount of\xa0solar powered stuff, generators and inverters that come in all kinds of shapes and sizes.  This year very few smartphone brands showed up for the event. Notable brands like Samsung, Colors, Gionee were absent on this event. The brand that did show up were Huawei, Sony, Micromax, Karbonn, DTC with nothing new to showcase. Apart from that, we saw few 4K Tv’s and headphones from Sony; few projectors, high-speed WiFi routers, printers, scanners and few laptops, mainly from Dell and Lenovo.        Few new names showed up during the event like Arun(Headphones & Powerbank), AEE(Action Camera & Drones), Netis\xa0(WiFi Amplifier and Routers), Pentax (Cameras) and many more. There are also few stalls with electrical scooters that are quite expensive but will do the job at this time of crisis.  And\xa0like expected\xa0there are a whole lot of stalls that provide computer and smartphone related accessories; USB Flash drives, portable HardDrives and power banks being the top selling products the event.  We really had our hopes high for the CAN event, we expected few drones, new notable hardware, IoT related stuff but could find none.

Recognizing that children and elderly citizens are more vulnerable, the team at Kaymu collected funds and made an attempt to bring a smile on their faces by helping them warm up this winter,” –Rajeev Amatya, the Managing Director at Kaymu.

Given the specs, we expect this phone to launch for around $110, with price in Nepal expected to be around Rs.13,999.   Huawei also recently launched a mid-range smartphone,  the Honor 5x , in China and US for $199 and features top of the line specs like 5.5-inch FullHD display, Octa-core Snapdragon 616 SoC, 3GB RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, 13/5MP camera setup, fingerprint sensor, metal build, and 3000mAh battery.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/honor-holly-2-plus.jpg']

"['WiFi 802.11 ad, 802.11 af, and 802.11 ah Expained!']","['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['January 16, 2016']",2016-01-16 10:04:48+00:00,"['We all have been familiar with the Wifi b/g/n/ac standards, \xa0but there are new Wifi standards in town that you should know about because it’s super awesome and defines how we use the internet in the future. So, before I explain about these new standards, I want you to read about the different\xa0Wi-Fi Standard  (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac)  that exists now.   Wi-Fi standard 802.11a and 802.11b, when first came in 1999, was an expensive technology.  Wi-Fi standard 802.11g arrived in 2003 was inexpensive and 5 times faster than the previous standards, and hence replaced 802.11a and 802.11b.  The number of users using Wireless Devices started to grow from 2003 because of its advantage over wired technology.  All these 3 standards use the 2.4GHz frequency band.  2.4GHz frequency band creates interference if there are overlapping networks in the same area (like a multi-story apartment building)  Wi-Fi 802.11n was announced in 2009 to eradicate this problem since it uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency band. The 5GHz band creates less interference.  Wi-Fi 802.11a/c\xa0is the latest evolution of Wi-Fi, which like the 802.11n, uses both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum.   WiFi 802.11 ad  The first new WiFi standard is 802.11 ad, which unlike other standards, uses a transmission frequency of 60GHz. This means it will have a super high speed of around 7Gb/s, however, it will have low coverage. It is only suitable for one room, and such frequency cannot penetrate the wall and the receiver should be in direct LOS (line of sight) with the router.         With a Gb/s speed, the advantage of such standard is\xa0blistering upload and download speeds meaning you can use it for transferring huge files, wireless storage, lag-free wireless docking, screen mirroring, and cordless VR glasses.  WiFi 802.11 ah  The Wifi 802.11ah is just the opposite of the WiFi 802.11 ad. Rather than focusing on the speed, it focuses on the transmission range. 802.11ah is transmitted at just 900 MHz, much similar to the GSM transmission frequency. Since the frequency is lower than that of the existing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi technologies, 802.11ah standard can transmit up to 1km. However, the speed is not that great and it decreases with respect to distance.   Although the speed ranges from 150Kb/s to 18Mb/s, such speed is ideal for low powering devices like  Internet of Things ,  Wireless Sensor Networks , etc.  WiFi 802.11 af  The Wifi 802.11 af, also known as Super Wifi, relies on unused television spectrum frequencies between 54 MHz and 790 MHz. Just like 802.11 ah, it can be used for low power, wide-area range, only better. It has more than 10kms of coverage making it\xa0 the longest range WiFi technology yet.\xa0The Wifi 802.af can be utilized in places where there are fewer buildings and less interference.  SUMMARY –  WiFi 802.11 ad Vs  WiFi 802.11  ah Vs  WiFi 802.11  af    802.11ad : for Gb/s speeds and high-performance networking.  802.11ah : for low data rate, long-range sensors, and controllers.  802.11af : for similar applications to 802.11ah. This network option relies on unused TV spectrums instead of 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands for transmission.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wifi-802.11.jpg']

Before installing the OS you need a USB 3.0 Flash Storage with 8GB (FAT32) or more with R/W speed of 20MB/s.          Download Remix OS  zip file (Legacy or EFI) depending on your system and unzip it.  Launch the Remix OS USB tool or any third party USB Boot Tool.  Browse and Select the Remix OS ISO file and Select OK.  Reboot your PC.  Enter into Boot Mode pressing F12 during startup or other function keys  Select “USB Storage Device” as boot option  Select either “Guest Mode” or “Resident Mode” to start Remix OS.   If you select the  Guest Mode , all of the activities and data wouldn’t be saved, it’s a fresh new start with every Guest Mode. And if you select  Resident Mode , all your activities and data will be saved for future use, for that you might need a USB flash drive with larger capacity.  Note that , the Remix OS is currently in Alpha, so there’s nothing much that you can do here. Right now it’s purely intended for developers to test and figure out some bugs before the final release. Also there is no Google Play Services on the official Remix OS package due to some licencing issues, but you can install it using a third party apk from the link below:  GAPPS FOR REMIX OS 2.0  In future updates, we’ll see complete Google Services in the official Remix OS package.

We know we are not believers of such apps because for some it works but for mostly it doesn’t. This app is a different one, a unique one in fact, with a different and entertaining concept to help us stay off our phones.         This app called “Forest: Stay focused” developed by forestapp.cc is entirely different and amusing from other apps with the same purpose. This app revolves around a tree and a forest. If you want to stay off your phone, you open the app and plant a little tree that grows to become a fully-grown in about 30 minutes. The tricky part is letting it grow. So while it grows you should stay off your phone. If you try to launch a game, even take a phone call, press the give up button, or even minimize or close the app, the tree dies which you don’t want. This little tree is what makes it worthwhile because you care for this small tree. Many people feel guilty and sad to bring down the tree that they themselves planted in the first place, they would want to see their tree grow and grow fruits or flowers or whatever they expect.   I know, staying off their phones for many people is impossible and I know the app is implausible but kudos to the developers of Forest for the fine concept of the app. Well, I don’t know if this app would help anyone to be more productive or not, that depends on the person using it but like the title says it’s a unique app and the concept is really cool.

Apart from that, the LG V10 features 5MP Dual Front Cameras with two separate lenses to capture standard 80-degree selfies or perfect wide angle selfies of 120 degrees, without the need to pan the smartphone which increases the likelihood of camera shake. For the wide angle shot, the V10 employs a sophisticated software algorithm to combine images from the two separate lenses which are just far enough apart to provide two different points of view.   As far as the design goes, the V10’s frame is composed of SAE grade 316L stainless steel, with “resilient but soft Dura Skin” on the back and bottom of the phone.

It has a fully circular screen like the Moto 360, it’s attractive as well as premium, and comes with an improved battery life.\xa0The Huawei Watch is part of the third generation of Android Wear devices and is one of the most expensive Android Wear watches at Rs. 75,000.  Design and Build Quality:  The best thing about the Huawei watch is its design. Its light weight and premium. The screen is protected by a\xa0Sapphire crystal glass and the device is water and dust proof. \xa0The circular display for me looks more appealing than the square display of the Apple watch.         Display:  The Huawei watch features a 1.4 inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels netting a pixel density of 286ppi. The screen is vivid, bright, and sharp thanks to the AMOLED display.   Hardware Specs:  The Huawei Watch features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC with quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 processor, coupled with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. It sports a PPG Heart rate sensor, 6-axis motion sensor (gyro + accelerometer), and barometer. For connectivity, it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 BLE.  Software and Performance:  The Huawei Watch runs on v1.3 of Android Wear, although Google has already announced v1.4 platform for wearables. It is compatible with smartphones, running Android 4.3 or iOS 8.2 and up. Using the watch is super simple. The watch face shows the time and there are more than 40 themes to choose from. You can change the theme by long pressing the screen.   Swiping to the left takes you to the app drawer where you can view all your apps in alphabetical order. Swiping to the left one more time takes you to your list of contacts and swiping\xa0a third one takes you to Google voice search with which you can take voice commands to your smartwatch.   With Google Fit integration, the device lets you keep track of your steps.\xa0Daily tracking app lets you monitor number of steps, calories burnt, and the number of times you stood up from your chair.  Battery:  The Huawei watch boasts a 300mAh Li-Ion battery, and provides 1.5 days of uptime. It also supports fast charging which lets you charge the battery from 0 to 80% in just 45 minutes.  Verdict:  I really like the Huawei watch: Its comfortable, premium, and has good battery life. But, for some reason, Huawei has launched this device in Nepal for an exorbitant price of\xa0Rs.75,000. The Huawei watch is priced at $350 in the US, and paying more than twice for a smartwatch which has fewer practical use and will be obsolete in a year doesn’t make any sense.

['Choosing a Ringtone: Not that easy!'],['Apps'],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['December 26, 2015']",2015-12-25 19:39:29+00:00,"['We all know that a Ringtone is a musts for every phone. Whether it is a feature phone or a smart phone, we all need and use ringtones. But are we choosing a ringtone\xa0in a correct way?  In this article lets try to phase out some of the common problems in choosing a ringtone\xa0and their probable solutions.  COMMON PROBLEMS:   Ringtone is  not so loud .  Ringtone is  very loud .  Ringtone is\xa0 not ringing .  Ringtone is  ringing at unnecessary places .  Problems related to Ringtone sounds and others.   So, now since we’ve broken down the problems, here are the solutions that cover all the aforesaid problems.        CHOOSING A RINGTONE:  Choosing a ringtone can be tough. Some people might like it loud and clear, some like it thumpy and love a glow of melody in their ringtones. But are we\xa0actually choosing a perfect ringtone? Let’s see.  A ringtone actually describes you as a person,\xa0yes it does.\xa0Just like a song you listen describes your preferences so does a ringtone you assign assigns your persona. If you own an iPhone, you might have noticed that their primary ringtone is\xa0subtle, classy and at the same time clear. That was made in a way that describes that person holding that phone. Also, i’m a big fan of the ringtones by other mobile manufacturers and if you notice all of their\xa0default\xa0ringtones indeed are something.  If you are a businessman, you would not like your phone\xa0to ring”Oppa Gangnam Style” every time someone calls you. Of course that’s a turn off. or Your phone should be in silent in your classroom (if the college/school allows you to have a phone).  So, here are a few Do’s and Don’ts before choosing a ringtone:  DO’S:   Always choose a ringtone that is clear and subtle. Like MIDI music, there should be beats of music.  Use a ringtone that has music instead of vocals. If you are using a song as you ringtone, clip to the part where there’s melody and use it.  Make sure the notification sounds for your messages are clear too.  Mix up your ringtones with Vibration, so that you won’t miss a thing.  Ringtones with an adequate bass is good since it would be subtle at the same time clear.  People with hearing problem should preferably put their\xa0phone to vibrate mode rather than pumping up the ringtone volume.  Use profile management apps, to change your profile to silent or Vibrate or Loud in various locations.   DON’TS:   Try to avoid using “a song vocal” (in particular)\xa0\xa0as your ringtone since you are sure to miss a call most of the times.  It is normal to get bored after sticking with a same ringtone. But changing it too often can make you forget your current ringtone. (True story)  Do not pump the Volume of your ringtone to the highest level. There are people around you and you have to respect their privacy.  Do not put your phone into ringing mode when you’re in a meeting, seminar, conference, theaters or anywhere where there’s a gathering and people have something to listen to rather than your phone playing with a Bollywood number\xa0“Baby Doll mein sone di”.  Lastly,\xa0Do not use offensive things as your ringtone. (I don’t think one needs a reason for that!)   There’s nothing wrong though in choosing a ringtone of the song you love the most. But make sure it can at least serve its primary purpose of letting you know of an incoming call or text.  Check out  Zedge.net , There are tons of great Ringtones, or choose it from you default ringtones.  Have something to add to the story?

But what is it? Is this an issue that can detriment us? Will it affect Nepalese audience? Let’s find out here.  Net Neutrality is a general principle that says The Internet should be treated equally by Internet service providers and Governments. This means No matter which website or apps you use via internet, it should be treated equally. Your IPSs should provide the same bandwidth to whichever website you are browsing whether it is YouTube or Facebook.         Net Neutrality in Context of Nepal  Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)  charges you the same amount of cash whether you use a refrigerator or a microwave Oven. Net neutrality targets to do something similar with your Internet wires. Parties against Net Neutrality – basically  Internet Service Providers  (ISPs) thinks that they should differ bandwidth according to the services. They believe they should charge more for high-bandwidth services like Netflix, Skype, online games etc. They could even block\xa0internet service or deliberately slowed them down.  Moreover, Telecom service providers like NTC or NCELL can charge extra when you are making a VoIP calls from Viber or Whatsapp. For e.g., All Internet/data packs or plans shall only be valid for internet browsing and will exclude VoIP (Both incoming/ Outgoing). VoIP over data connectivity would be charged at standard data rates of Rs.1 per 1MB.\xa0This is a dangerous practice which could have a far-reaching impact on consumers.

Because, Nepal Police has brought a fake detector in Nepal for the first time. Also, a digital forensic lab has been brought in use for it.  With the dramatic increase in fraud activities in social media nowadays, Nepal Police is compelled to bring this technology in Nepal where it can detect a person with a fake identity and the police will be able to punish them accordingly. Around 30 incidences happen every year through internet due to fake identities, but every time the suspect used to get released easily due to lack of proper equipment to identify their fault. But now, with this new technology, police will be able to punish the fraud properly.         The forensic kit was provided to Nepal Police by Central Investigation Bureau around two weeks ago, where the skill personals tested the device and were trained. The kit is made with American technology which can make surveillance easy, from social media to email gateway. As the technology is recognized worldwide, the result provided by it will be accepted in national as well as international courts.  As every crime uses technology nowadays, this new technology will be effective to minimize every kind of crime that happen in the country. The technical things that the suspect use, for example, mobile phones, laptops/computers, pen drives or any digital items are scanned (everything) through the forensic kit and any clue related to the crime will be identified through it.  Police have hoped that this new technology will help to find out frauds easily and quickly, as it replaces the old lengthy technique where the suspects used to get interviewed. As the crimes nowadays use digital technology, so it was crucial for police to investigate digitally. Nepal Police had actually already introduced some digital technology before such as finger print scanning and polygraph testing. Now with this new device, it will be even easier to reduce crimes in the country.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nepal-police-forensic-lab.jpg']

If you had gone to any governmental offices in recent days, you might have noticed website addresses written on notice boards. This is because you can also use services online rather than troubling yourself to visit there unnecessarily. Similarly, there are many other sectors where the government is stepping in a digital way. Some of them are: using MRP (Machine Readable Passport) instead of hand written passport, using digital panels on the side of the roads for sharing traffic rules and regulations, information on weather, and so on. Also, Sajha Bus has introduced smart card system in one of their buses (which is in a trial period now). Similar to the above mentioned, the government is also bringing a new form of smart card – a smart driver’s license card in Nepal.  The government is changing the hand written license card into digital smart card from Mangsir 15, 2072 which will be effective at first only in Kathmandu. After 2 weeks of trial, the system will be used all over the country. Though the government had planned this system to bring into operation from Shrawan month, the planned failed due to the devastating earthquake that occurred in Baisakh and delayed to Mangsir. Government actually brought this system by taking loan of 15 crore rupees from Asian Development Bank.  What is smart license card?  It is the same license card that we normally use but in digital form. That is, the card will have a chip similar to that used in our SIM card, and the whole card looks like an ATM card. It also works like ATM card too, where the chip stores all the information required. The information includes your whole details, from your name to your address, the expiry date, the vehicle you are using, its number, the information of your bluebook, etc. Now you don’t have to worry about carrying your bluebook and license and worry about them to get damaged in rain.        smart driving license  The only thing you need to make this card is to go to Department of Transport Management and fill your information, and take pictures similar to adding your name in voter’s list. You can also use online service to fill your information, but you need to be there for taking picture and provide digital signature (your own signature which will be scanned through laser).  How does the card work?  You will be provided with the smart card, which you should be carrying all the time with you while driving. The traffic police and the transport management officials will carry the smart card reader machine with them, and you can be asked any time to provide them your card if they have any doubts on you or if you happen to be in any checking. There will be no any excuse if you have done anything wrong because all the information will be displayed in the reader machine as soon as the card is inserted.  smart driving license in Nepal to be introduced in Nepal in December  This smart card system is hoped to control frauds and provide much smoother system in license handling. This will decrease your unnecessary visit to transport management office and wait for those irritating queues.

So many things happen to be discovered day by day. Even a person can be unaware of the gadgets that his neighbor is using for months.  Technology has made life so easy that you don’t have to worry about simple things. Yes, there are some complications but again it brings a solution for them. For example, smartphones were introduced and made life so much easy and luxurious. But it can’t solve the problem of battery life. Then power banks were introduced which ended your worry of searching electricity to charge your phone. But still, as the power banks being bulky and heavy to handle, batteries have now started to come in human wearables.         Nifty, a UK-based company has introduced a belt which can charge your smartphone. Yes, a belt that charges a smartphone. Actually not an only smartphone, but every phone that can be charged through USB. The company named the belt as ‘Xoo Belt’ and the design is done by collaborating with a fashion company Casley Hayford.  \xa0  The belt is a solution for everyday problem of people – the battery of mobile phone. It is designed in such a way that it doesn’t look like a battery hanging around your waist. Rather it looks stylish and comfortable to wear, same as a normal belt and also easy to charge phones. There are two types of battery attached to the belt, one is a simple battery fitted inside the 3D-printed buckle and another one is inside the strap. The battery inside the strap is a new breed of Lithium Ceramic Polymer battery and is so flexible that it can easily be bent in any direction as the leather of the strap. Another specialty of this battery is that it can be cut in any length and still works, which is a good news for skinny people. Being water-resistant and ultra-safe to use, this belt is expected to hit the world market. The total capacity of battery is 2100mAh, which is enough to full charge a smartphone.  https://youtu.be/v3X4hvo4wjY  The charging method is so cool that you can charge the belt in the same manner you charge your phone every day – just plug the USB into your computer or any phone charger and that’s it. The full charge can be done in just 3 hours. Charging your phone from it is even cooler. It comes with a USB cable inside it attached along with the belt with a magnet, your work is just to pull down the cable whenever you need and connect your phone and your phone starts to charge. Move the cable around your waist as your comfort and put the phone inside the pocket. Put the cable back to its position after you finish charging. In a nutshell, this belt has made our life so easy that you don’t have to worry about remembering any additional chargers, the only thing you need to remember is to charge the belt after it discharges and yes, don’t forget to wear it as you leave your home.  You will get a little worry when it comes to the price. It comes with different color and design where price ranges from $149 to $199 and is currently not available in Nepal. But, it is just a matter of time and patience when a Chinese company makes a prototype of it and introduces in Nepal at really cheap price.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/belt-charge.jpg']

It’s a great feature to have in a smartphone, yet manufacturers keep on avoiding it. There are few reasons why companies do it. Here are some of them:    To earn more money\xa0  Most often what smartphone manufacturers\xa0do is they launch several versions of the product. One comes with a lower storage\xa0while the other comes with a higher storage. Customer will have to pay $50 to $200 extra if they wish to buy a higher storage. They don’t include a microSD card slot, so we will left with no choice other than to pay an extra to get the higher version. This was primarily the strategy of Apple’s iPhone, which was followed by other manufacturers like Samsung and Xiaomi.    Poor Performance of MicroSD cards   According to Xiaomi’s VP Hugo Barra, MicroSD cards are vulnerable to failure and in a most cases malfunction in various conditions. Some of the issues caused by microSD cards reported by Android smartphones users are app crashing and loss of data. Also, Considering that there are lots of low-quality microSD cards available in the market that can lead to poor performance. If you are a tech savvy, we suggest you invest on Class 10 microSD cards.    Cloud Storage as a solution   When your internal storage run out, the only solution is to backup your photos and videos on Cloud. By removing the microSD card feature, it will be a lot easier for cloud storage provider (some of which are smartphone manufacturer) to market their product to consumers. Although most of us here in Nepal don’t pay for the cloud storage because of egregious internet speed, there are substantial customers in the west who pay a monthly fee to enroll for a cloud service.

All of the apps are free and downloadable from Play store. Also these apps are in randomized order so you decide which one you like the most.    BuMP Music Player :    Has support for Spotify which let’s you play downloaded music from Spotify premium.  There are plenty of music players out there. But Bump has taken a more simpler approach as a music player. It is just like Facebook messenger’s floating bubble which you can drag around and place it somewhere comfortable to reach. And if you want to close it just drag and drop the bubble.  There are no any extra features here, just that it is a music player and it plays music, that’s why the size of this app is just below 5MB. It has a pretty neat and simple UI with tabs like tracks, albums and artists. What’s even great is that it even has support for Spotify which let’s you play downloaded music from Spotify premium.           Flud Torrent Client :    Flud is one of the most well designed and feature rich  torrent client  out there. There’s just no match for it. Features you had to pay on other torrent apps, well it’s free here. There are no in app purchases, except for upgrading to pro which will just remove the ads.  It offers power management options like shutting down app when download completes  This app is that it offers power management options like shutting down app when download completes, download or upload torrent only while phone is charging, and putting battery limit upto only which torrent will be downloaded. Except these there are many other features there which you should try. If you are a torrent freak, this is probably the best app for you.     Tuffs :    Tuffs is an pretty handy app that let’s you keep apps on your notification drawer. You can put some of your most used apps there and get quick access to it. You can also access it form the lock screen. \xa0And it has couple of themes to suite the theme of your notification drawer. Not only that but you can pick custom colors to personalize it even more. But I highly recommend to turn off these background themes as they lower the quality of the icons. You can keep up to 8 apps.  It’s a really handy app to get quick access to your frequently used apps.     Flynx :    Flynx is a minimal browser that takes the form of floating bubble. So if you come across any link you don’t have to leave that app to visit the link, you can simply open it in the same app window. It usually displays sites on lite version of the web which makes loading of content faster. also it allows you to view in desktop mode making this app no less than any other full fledge browser. You can also save the webpages for later which is a great handy feature. \xa0It is just like the link bubble app but I find it more stable and faster to use.     Stitch and share :    Stitch and share is a handy app that helps you to attach multiple screenshots. All you have to do is match the last message of first screenshot with the first message of second screenshot and so on. You can stitch as much screenshots as you want and make a single image out of it.    Feel free to comment your best top 5 Android apps.

Are these Chinese manufacturers taking less profit or the big guns making more?\xa0Read on to find out\xa0why Chinese smartphones are so incredibly inexpensive.  1. Chinese manufacturers have lower Labor Cost  Almost all the smartphones are made in China because the country has one of the lowest labor cost, but Chinese smartphone brands are\xa0benefited even more because their manufacturing plant is located in local areas and they have to pay even less wage to local people. Companies like Samsung and Apple have to pay more for transportation costs, and hiring staffs from abroad nations. The  total cost for assembling an iPhone  is more than Xiaomi, despite requiring the same amount of time to do so.          2. Big Guns spend a fortune on R&D; Chinese company emulate them  Apple  and  Samsung  spend a lot of money on their R&D projects to embark innovation. For eg. Apple spent millions of dollars on the revolutionary fingerprint sensor. Samsung spent millions of dollars on their latest 14nm  Exynos processor .  That’s not the case with Chinese smartphones. They don’t come with cutting edge technology, yet is powerful and well-built. For eg. The Meizu Pro 5 features the same Exynos 7420 chipset as the one used on high-end Note 5, and the other specs are fairly similar to that of Note 5, however, the Pro 5 costs $440 and the Note 5 costs $850.  3. Most of the Chinese Smartphones are sold Online  This is\xa0 a common strategy for Chinese smartphones. They only sell their products via E-commerce websites. This will help keep the price of smartphone low because when you sell online you save a lot of money on distribution and opening a retail outlets\xa0(physical stores) comes with a running costs.   4.   Zero Marketing Policy  Companies like Samsung and HTC spend millions on Advertisement, hoarding boards, and online ads.   In contrast, Chinese phones provide value for money products for which no marketing is required. Consumers are not stupid. When you compare  OnePlus X  with  Samsung Galaxy J5  (Both smartphones that cost little under $250), Consumer will definitely go with the One Plus X no matter how much marketing is done by Samsung. In 2013  Samsung spent $14 billion on Marketing and promotion  This marketing factor is one of the reason why the product have higher margin leading to higher cost.  5. Income from Theme store  Most of the Chinese smartphones runs on skinned version of UI. With such UI’s, there are a lots of themes to choose from–some are free and some are paid. Xiaomi, for instance, earns over $8 million in monthly revenue from apps, games, and theme customization installed on MIUI.

We often overlook other aspects of the SD cards, which could play a bigger role during a day to day performance. With so many SD cards in the market, it’s important to understand which SD memory card works best with your device. Here are the top six markings of the SD cards you should know before you buy one:   1. Storage: This is the most common thing about SD cards. This indicates the total storage of the SD card. It can range from 1GB to upto 512 GB. More the storage, more you be able to store photos and videos.        2. Write Protect Logo:  The logo represents if the button on the left side is plugged in downwards or upwards.   If the button is plugged upwards, you can erase and write all your files and folders.  If the button is plugged downwards, erasing or writing the data is impossible.   3. Read Speed  It represents the maximum read speed that the SD card can spit out. It is based on the manufacturer’s internal testing. Usually, the write Speed of the SD card is typically lower than the read speed. The circle marking in this\xa0photo shows the read speed of the SD card. It says 95MB/s, but usually, it is much lower in real time usage.   4.\xa0Formats  There are currently three SD factors:      Secure Digital Standard Capacity (SDSC or SD):  FAT 12/16 file system  max storage- 2GB    Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC or MicroSD):  FAT32 file system  max storage- 32GB    Secure Digital Extreme Capacity (SDXC)  exFAT\xa0file system  max storage- 2TB      5.\xa0Speed Class  Speed class denotes the minimum write speed of the SD card. There are currently 4 Speed Classes that is defined by the SD Association\xa0–Class 2, Class 4, Class 6, and Class 10.  As the name suggests, Class 2 means minimum write is speed is 2MB/s, Class 4 means 4MB/s and so on. Usually, Class 2 SD card is used for video recording, Class 4 and Class 6 SD card is used for Full HD video recording and Class 10 SD card is used for HD and Full HD video still consecutive recording.

['Understanding Wi-Fi Standard (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac)'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['November 3, 2015']",2015-11-03 13:42:57+00:00,"['Over two decades ago, the wireless transmission wasn’t popular as it’s now in 2015. Back then, there were only two Wireless standards-  802.11a  and \xa0802.11b\xa0 operating at\xa0 2.4 GHz  frequency. People were more dependent on wired networks. But people soon started to realize what Wireless Platform\xa0brings in terms of easiness and portability. The popularity of Wi-Fi begin to grow in 2003 and soon wireless devices with  802.11g  standard\xa0were announced\xa0which\xa0was inexpensive unlike 802.11a and 802.11b standards and was indeed super fast at 54Mbps.  \xa0  With so many users opting for wireless devices in mid-2000’s, there start to emerge issues regarding signal losses with these wireless standards.        THE\xa0 RE ASON?? Apart from Wi-Fi, other devices like Bluetooth & Microwave are also based on the same frequency band. The trend of\xa0using Bluetooth in peripherals like headphones, mouse, speakers\xa0etc. has been common nowadays. Moreover, there are routers in almost every house or perhaps every floor in corporate buildings. Hence, these scenario causes traffic of Frequencies\xa0leading to Interference (Noise) between\xa0signals. Due to this interference and noise created by collision of 2.4 GHz signal, customer face slow internet issues.  WHAT’S THE REMEDY?  To eradicate this problem, in 2009, came the  802.11n  wireless standard that operated in either the 2.4GHz or 5 GHz spectra (DUAL BAND). The primary benefit of 5 GHz band is the reduced Interference. Microwaves and Bluetooth don’t operate in that frequency, so there’s less interference. Furthermore, in 5GHz frequency, the signal generated only travels smaller distance (unlike 2.4 GHz where signal travels more distance). If you remember basic physics that you learned in high school, given the same power, the higher the frequency, the shorter the distance a signal can travel i.e.  D= C/F Where,\xa0 D = distance traveled by a signal  F = frequency of the signal  C = speed of light Hence, 5GHz signal travels smaller distance than that of 2.4GHz signal which will lead to less interference. In simple words, your home Wi-Fi that operates in 5 GHz spectrum won’t interfere with your neighbor’s Wi-Fi.  So,\xa0if you are connecting lots of devices, or if there are overlapping networks in the same area (like a multi-story apartment building) then an 802.11n routers are the better choice. However, the \xa0802.11n routers are more expensive than the 2.4 GHz 802.11 a/b/g routers, so you should go with the 2.4GHz ones unless the interference is a real issue with your network.  802.11n standard also has a 2.4GHz spectrum because at the time of it’s release there were laptops, phones, etc. who only had 802.11a/b/g wireless standard.\xa0The 802.11n was a revolution in Wireless technology. Not only the interference problem was solved, but also, the signal strength was stronger and less power was required to get your signal above the noise floor, which resulted in enhanced battery life(for laptops and smartphones) in addition to better network performance. Almost every Wireless device have 802.11n nowadays.  In early 2014,  802.11ac  was announced. As of now, 802.11ac is the latest evolution of Wi-Fi, which like the 802.11n, uses both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum. The fastest current 802.11n Wi-Fi connections max out at around 150Mbps with one antenna, 300Mbps with two and 450Mbps with three antennas. 802.11ac connections are roughly three times faster. Latest routers\xa0and smartphones have 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac.  SUMMARY:     Wi-Fi standard 802.11a and 802.11b, when first came in 1999, was expensive.   Wi-Fi standard 802.11g arrived in 2003 which was inexpensive.   Users started to use Wireless Devices since 2003. The number of wireless users grew in number   All these 3 standard uses 2.4GHz frequency band.   2.4GHz frequency band creates interference if there are overlapping networks in the same area (like a multi-story apartment building)   Wi-Fi 802.11n was announced in 2009 to eradicate this problem since this standard uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency band. The 5GHz band creates less interference.

"['What is Firmware, Bootloader, Rooting, Kernel and Custom ROM in Android?']","['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['November 2, 2015']",2015-11-02 04:37:46+00:00,"['Android is an open source platform built on top of Linux. Being an open source, if you have a peek knowledge about android programming, you can change a whole lot in this platform. The best thing about android is obviously all the customization it allows. But if you’re an android enthusiast or more precisely an android fanboy, you can’t just live with the customizations manufacturers allow on their device. That’s why you move a step further to unlock the bootloader, root your device, add some MOD’s, change the kernel or change the whole ROM itself for a\xa0 whole new experience.  For most of users, they might be familiar with the unlocking bootloader, rooting or changing kernels, but they might have no idea what these terms really are or what functions they possess. Here’s a brief description about each of these terms related to Android.  Firmware:         Firmware basically refers to the Operating System you’re using on your android like the windows you run on your PC.\xa0 A stock firmware is a software that comes pre-loaded when you buy a new smartphone. Firmware is flashed on the ROM rather than phone’s storage, like in the PC so that an event of crash or malfunction won’t wipe out the system. You may have also noticed software update section on your smartphone which basically means updating your phone’s firmware to solve some bugs or to add some new features.  Bootloader:  Bootloader of Stock Android  The bootloader in android is what BIOS is in Windows. It is the first that runs on your smartphone when you turn it ON and runs the instructions to boot an operating system, it’s kernels, and checks the disk partitions for errors or missing links. Bootloaders are usually locked and encrypted so that the system files are not hindered or modified to make sure the phone functions smoothly. So what is unlocking the bootloader?  Unlocking the bootloader is basically decrypting it to gain the root access. And what is root access? we’ll get to that later. When you unlock the bootloader, you can load some specific files into the system memory or ROM, so you can have that extra added features or access on your firmware.\xa0 It’s usually for loading root files and Xposed files during startup so that you have the privilege of root access and Xposed Modules.  Rooting:   Rooting means getting access or permissions to your system settings. It’s like “running a program as administrator” in Windows. A root user in the terms of LINUX is called a Super User or SU, which you might be familiar with. By rooting your device, you have all the access to the system which you can modify or tweak according to your need. You can vary almost every aspect of the OS by rooting your device. But you need to have a good knowledge of what you’re doing or you might mess up the whole system. By rooting your device, you can install custom Kernels which can improve the battery life and performance of your device. Also, by simply installing root apps you can do a lot with your phone. Xposed framework is one the easiest and stable add-on for android out there to tweak its various aspects, with its different modules you can add a lot of functionality to your device making your device more functional and easy to use. The major cause for rooting, for most of the users, is to get rid of the boat  Xposed framework is one the easiest and stable add-on for android out there to tweak its various aspects, with its different modules you can add a lot of functionality to your device making your device more functional and easy to use. The major cause for rooting, for most of the users, is to get rid of the bloatware. Bloatware is the apps that come pre-loaded from the manufacturer on your new device, which, most of them, you might not need or use and takes a lot of memory out of the device. So getting rid of them will normally speed up the performance of the phone. But the backside of rooting is that it’ll void your warranty and if you’re not following proper guidelines, you might mess up the device and brick it.  Kernel:   The kernel is a\xa0bridge or an\xa0interface layer between software and the hardware. It is integrated with the “boot.img” file you find in the system. When software needs to do anything with the hardware, it sends a request to the kernel through which it reaches the hardware. Kernel decides when things will happen, like when you adjust the brightness slider, how much brightness will change or when you select a certain app, OS sends a request to the kernel to open the app, and when kernel grants it, then only the app will load and open. Every touch of your finger on the screen and the way system responds to it, depends on the kernel. So when you change a kernel, you completely change how the software of the device responds or works along with the hardware. With a new kernel, you can have added features like Double Tap to Unlock, off-screen gestures, under-clock or overclock the device and many more.  Custom ROM:   Custom ROM is replacing your stock firmware with a new or modified version of Android. With custom ROM, you get a complete UI overhaul, meaning if your device is Samsung and you’re using Touch Wiz, by installing a custom ROM you can have the UI of the HTC devices i.e. HTC Sense or like the Nexus Devices (stock android). These ROMs are just some modifications done over the original android source and made compatible with the device. Also, with custom ROM, you can upgrade your android version even if your manufacturer doesn’t provide you a firmware update. Also, custom ROM gives you a lot of handy functionality and features. Also changing your ROM sometimes can change your Kernel for better optimization with the ROM. And the size of these ROM’s is usually very low, helping to improve the overall performance of the phone. This is the beauty of Android, you won’t get this level of customization option in any other mobile platforms.  \xa0  These are the basic things or terminology you have to know as an android user as it might come really handy. There’s always a risk when you try to alter your stock firmware so you’ve to strictly follow the guidelines mentioned in the online forums and tutorials. But there’s always a way to recover your android device but make sure to backup the whole system before you try anything.

But it’s not the display that will make you drool, it has an almighty 24MP rear camera that uses technology similar to Nokia’s PureView also a dedicated camera button. Gionee Elife E8\xa0sports metal edges with plastic finish which keeps everything intact making it thin at just 9.6mm.   Gionee Elife E8 is marked as a premium phone with a fine metal finish round the edges, an amazing display, stunning camera, fingerprint sensor and a big battery. But considering the price of the phone, one might find it disappointing that the phone uses MediaTek’s Helio X10 chipset instead of Snapdragon’s 800 Series (808 or 810). ON GeekBench 3 (Multicore), Helio X10 outperforms SD 810, but on real life usage SD 810 surpasses Helio X10 with flying colors.         Talking about Gionee Elife E8’s 24MP (5696 x 4272pixels) camera, its laser auto-focus can grab its target in between 0.08 and 0.2 seconds which makes taking photos really snappy and blur free. It also boasts six element lens covered with sapphire glass. Gionee claims Elife E8 can take pictures at upto 120MP resolution. It also offers lossless zoom. What’s incredible about Gionee Elife E8 is that, it comes with a dedicated shutter button which is rare in smartphone these days. Gionee Elife E8’s camera also comes with Optical Image Stabilization which makes its videos steady and improves the night shots. And it supports 4K (2160p) recording at 30fps.

['Colors Xfactor Elite E10 Review: The budget Android Lollipop Smartphone'],"['Colors', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['October 19, 2015']",2015-10-19 04:38:13+00:00,"['Colors   recently\xa0launched the Colors Xfactor Elite E10 , a phone that costs a little under Rs. 13,000 and runs Android Lollipop out-of-the-box. It also has a Quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM. Should this be the smartphone any first-time buyer should consider? Let’s find out.  DESIGN:  Like any other pocket-friendly smartphone, the  Colors Xfactor Elite E10  comes with a plastic build quality. The gold trim running around the edges is actually made out of plastic, but Colors has given it a metallic coating to add some gleam. It has a glossy back panel and despite made completely out of plastic, the phone feels premium in the hands. It weighs 148 gms and is comfortable to hold and work with one hand.                      Let’s talk about its physical overview: On the front, there is A 5-inch screen and above it there is an earpiece, front camera, and ambient light sensor. Just below the screen, there is a row of touch-sensitive capacitive buttons for navigation, which is backlit. On the right-hand side, there is a power button and on the left are volume keys. We can find the micro USB port and headphone jack on top. There is a single speaker grill on the bottom. On the back side, we can see an 8MP shooter with dual tone LED flash. The back panel is removable giving it access to the battery, two SIM cards and microSD slot that is upgradable up to 32GB.        The screen is deprived of  Gorilla Glass  protection and we recommend you to get a screen protector to save the display from scratches. Also, inside the box content, you get a free flip cover that provides the phone with a little bit of protection too.  DISPLAY:   Colors Xfactor Elite E10 Benchmark Scores 350 and 1047 in single core and Multi-core Score resp.  The  Colors  Elite E10 comes with a 5 inch 720P IPS display. The screen is bright and produces accurate colors. However, it suffers when exposed to direct sunlight and has average viewing angles like other  budget-oriented smartphones . The touch is very responsive and supports up to 5 fingers.  SOFTWARE:  What we really like about this phone is it runs on Stock version of Android 5.1 Lollipop. It’s the closest that you get to Nexus experience. The chances of this phone getting the Marshmallow update is also very high.                   Colors have added some Gesture Control with which you can launch certain apps like Camera, Contacts, etc with ease. There is also double tap in feature that wakes up the phone with the double tap.  With flip cover, you get this neat looking watch face. You can get to quick settings if you swipe it. Where you’ll find options like message, settings, music etc. This is a pretty neat feature that we find really useful. You can even change it to digital mode, where you’ll also find the battery percentage, date and time.  PERFORMANCE:   The Colors Elite E10 has a quad core 1.3Ghz Cortex A7 32bit processor manufactured by spectrum. Since it’s a quadcore processor with 2GB RAM and runs a stock version of Android, multitasking is a breeze. However, this spectrum processor has a low performing cortex A7 cores which means it suffers a lot while running mid-end to high-end games. Having said that, the phone handles most of the casual games like temple run and subway surfers.  CAMERA :  The camera is one area where the phone disappoints. The 8MP primary camera once again points to the fact that Megapixel is not the only factor that matters. The camera is average at best with capabilities to take mediocre photos in daylight and grainy indoor photos.\xa0The front 2MP camera is also pretty average. You can take some casual selfies, but it’s nowhere near being a selfie camera.  The Colors Xfactor Elite E10 packed with 8MP Camera and an LED Flash  However, Colors have told us that they will be rolling out a software patch next week to fix the camera issue. We will let you know \xa0how much extent this update will fix the camera.  BATTERY:  Battery life of Elite E10 is also pretty average. The smartphone delivers one full day of battery life with light usage. Even with mediocre usage, you can eke out 5-6 hours of juice on one charge.  Colors Xfactor Elite E10, Removable back and SIM Slot and Additional Storage slot  The phone is deprived of quick charging and it takes approximately 2.5 hours for the rather small 2,000mAh battery of the smartphone to charge from 0 to 100% even with the bundled charger.  VERDICT:   As for the verdict, the Colors Xfactor Elite E10 is a decent smartphone for the price. It has a very good screen, runs stock android 5.1 lollipop, and has acceptable performance. However, camera performance and average battery life mean it is nowhere being a perfect budget phone.']",[]

['IBM reveals breakthrough in carbon nanotubes'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['October 5, 2015']",2015-10-05 09:32:41+00:00,"['All the existing system on a chip are made up of Silicon Transistors, but IBM\xa0has revealed a breakthrough in creating transistors that use\xa0carbon nanotubes. These nanotubes a re reported smaller in size (10nm), faster, efficient, and more powerful. \xa0  At this point,\xa014nm chips (used on Samsung’s latest phones Galaxy S6 and Note 5) seems to be the final node for Silicon FinFETs. Beyond 14nm, as we move down to 10nm, a new material will be required.\xa0Carbon nanotube transistor\xa0is the solution. It features a\xa0 new class of semiconductor materials that consist of single atomic sheets of carbon rolled up into a tube resulting in a superior electrical properties with electrons moving more quickly than\xa0in silicon-based devices.\xa0 It can operate at ten nanometers and\xa0have higher electron mobility than Silicon, allowing for lower voltages, and thus reducing power consumption, tunneling, and leakage.  Replacing the traditional silicon devices with the Carbon nanotube transistor will also result in high performance computers and smartphones, enabling larger Data to be processed faster, increasing the power and battery life of mobile devices and the IoTs (Internet of Things), and creating cloud data centers to deliver services more efficiently and economically.        CARBON COMPUTING: A Q&A WITH AN IBM RESEARCH’S SHU-JEN HAN  1. How are silicon and carbon similar when it comes to transistors?   Let’s start with carbon because it has so many different allotropes, from carbon nanotubes, graphene to diamonds. But diamonds, for example, are electrical insulators, not semiconductors – which are what we need for a transistor. Graphene is a two-dimensional sheet of pure carbon (yes, one-atom-thick) that can conduct current well, but it does not have a bandgap, therefore, transistors made with graphene cannot be switched off. Carbon nanotubes are a rolled-up form of graphene, which are somewhat similar to Silicon since they both have band gap and can be used as the center piece of the transistor – the channel.  2. Why are carbon nanotubes not in use like silicon?  Silicon has offered many advantages as a transistor material for the last half century. One biggest perhaps was that it forms a great gate dielectric – SiO2. For carbonnanotubes, many material issues have to be solved to obtain similar high-quality carbon nanotube wafers for device fabrication. We can’t switch to an entirely new material over night, but silicon is reaching its scaling limits.  3. How have you and your team solved this issue of contact resistance?  Carbon nanotubes conduct electricity much faster than silicon, and perhaps more importantly, they use less power than silicon. Plus, at just slightly over one nanometer in body thickness, they’re significantly thinner than today’s silicon, providing good electrostatic control. The challenge has, until now, been how to form high quality contacts between metal electrodes and carbon nanotubes.  In any transistor, two things scale: the channel and its two contacts. It’s at the contacts where carbon nanotube resistance, like silicon, has hindered performance. Especially when channel continues to shrink and channel resistance becomes less and less important. Essentially, current just cannot flow into the channel effectively when you hit atomic dimensions.  Dr. Qing Cao and my other teammates at [the IBM Watson Research Center] developed a way, at the atomic level, to weld – or bond – the metal molybdenum to the carbon nanotubes’ ends, forming carbide. Previously, we could only place a metal directly on top of the entire nanotube. The resistance was too great to use the transistor once we reached about 20 nm. But welding the metal at the nanotubes’ ends, or end-bonded contacts, is a unique feature for carbon nanotubes due to its 1-D structure, and reduced the resistance down to 9 nm contacts. Key to the breakthrough was shrinking the size of the contacts without increasing electrical resistance, which impedes performance. Until now, decreasing the size of device contacts caused a commensurate drop in performance.  4. \xa0What is necessary to scale this technology? And what is your next step in this work?  We must scale our carbon nanotube transistor onto a wafer. The challenge is twofold: it includes how to orient and place these 1 dimensional structures from the solution onto the wafer as well as how to purify them (initial solution has about 1/3 metallic tubes which are not useful for transistors and need be removed).  We’ve developed a way for carbon nanotubes to self-assemble and bind to specialized molecules on a wafer. The next step is to push the density of these placed nanotubes (to 10 nm apart) and reproducibility across an entire wafer.  5. What future nanotechnology are you looking forward to?  I can see the potential of our carbon nanotube chips to replace silicon for conventional computing uses. Better transistors can offer higher speed while consume less power. Plus, carbon nanotubes are flexible and transparent. They could be used in futuristic “more than Moore” applications, such as flexible and stretchable electronics or sensors embedded in wearables that actually attach to skin – and are not just bracelets, watches, or eyewear.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nanotubes.jpg']

['NTC Vs Ncell: Which carrier is the best?'],['Telecom'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['October 4, 2015']",2015-10-04 08:42:42+00:00,"['The two telecommunication giants of Nepal,  Ncell  and  NTC  are the only mobile communication carriers in Nepal. Either you hate it or love it. There are only two of them.  Although carriers’ have improved and plans have become more useful, it’s still a frustration trying to figure out which network offers the best deal for you. So we’re here to help you through this frustration. Let’s begin with the introduction of these carriers.  Comparison for\xa0NTC vs Ncell  NTC:  Nepal telecom is a state-owned company with 85% of government share. It is the sole provider of fixed line, ISDN and leased-line services in Nepal. It has about 60 million GSM cellular phones and about 1.5million CDMA users.  Ncell: Ncell is a privately owned GSM mobile operator in Nepal the company is now owned in 80% by Swedish/Finnish company “TeliaSonera Holdings.” Ncell is the largest telecom service provider (GSM), having 43% market share. It has crossed more than 80 lakhs customer. Clearly it has broken the monopoly of NTC in the telecommunication game.        Services: The real battle between these carriers is in the terms of their services and data/call charges.  Call/SMS Charges:  NTC  has had the same call charges for many years now with no additional services included.  Inside Nepal SMS: Rs. 1.00 per SMS International SMS: Rs. 5.00 per SMS  Please Visit the  NTC tariff page  for latest Tariff  Ncell  has come up with two tariff plans as per the necessity of the users: 1.\xa0 Sajilo Tariff: With its motto “One rate across the nation!” It provides the basic telecommunication facility with basic call/data charges. Wherever you call within Ncell or to other networks within Nepal, you call at one rate. It has been a popular tariff plan with its “My5” service.  2. Ramro Tariff: Ramro tariff lets you talk to your friends and family at a cheaper rate with its services like“3Ramro Number”.  Please Visit the  Ncell\xa0tariff page  for latest Tariff  Mobile Data Service:  Both NTC and Ncell rely on\xa0HSPA+ 3G services, and both have yet to launch 4G services. Although NTC data prices are comparatively lower, but Ncell provides a wider range of data package schemes with which you can get access to the various services in a better price.      NTC  Ncell    Re. 1.00 per MB (24 hrs)  Re. 1.50 per MB (24 hrs)      More on Ncell: Ncell has been really creative, innovative\xa0when it comes to providing luring services to its customers whereas nothing has really changed when it comes to NTC. Whether its marketing campaign or its online presence Ncell has got it all balanced. Ncell is also more accessible as we find Ncell Centers around every corner. Services like “Missed call notification”, “Ncell Sapati”,”Power Recharge”, “SMS & Data Packs” and occasional offers to its users has been highly appreciated. This has helped Ncell to build a strong customer base and also profit. No wonder it pays the highest income-tax. As a private company, it also has been donating a lot for the social causes, this has created a positive outlook towards the company. Seeing this, the future of Ncell looks promising.  Verdict: Both the carriers have their own pros and cons. While Ncell hasn’t been able to extend its services to every nook and cranny of Nepal, NTC has already accomplished that for now. Though there have been many complaints regarding the services of NTC there has not been much change to its services and quality where on the other hand Ncell is doing everything in its reach to provide the best services to its customers with its good online presence and amazing offers time and again. Ncell has continued expanding coverage, enhancing quality and bringing new, efficient and easy-to-use services to the people. Though the services of NTC is somehow good inside the valley, but it’s not the same story outside. We cannot ignore the flexibility of services provided by Ncell. People have already realized that the government services of are no use and NTC is no exception. So for the time being, the best carrier for Nepalese would be Ncell, looking over its quality services and customer satisfaction index.

But is it really worth the price we’re paying for? \xa0With the recent teardown of the new iPhone 6S. It is estimated that the cost of solely making an iPhone 6s is just around $234 without counting manufacturing and distribution costs. Note that the cost of unlocked 64GB iPhone6s is $749 which is completely insane with the profit of around ss$515 in every single phone. Apple sells millions of iPhone every year, no wonder it is the most profitable business in the history of mankind.         Here are the list and price of items used in iPhone 6s.   $8 to $11 for assembly and testing  $20 for 64GB flash memory  $22 for sensors like NFC, fingerprint etc  $25 for the new A9 processor  $33 for the case of phone  $73 for screen, camera, and battery \xa0  $127 for semiconductor pieces    \xa0 Despite all the new changes and improvement in the new iPhone 6s, it costs little over $28 more than the iPhone 6 to make one.

Even with the overall improvements made in the new iPhone and more sophisticated components used, Apple is able to cut down the increased costs. This implies to all the Apple products, their profit margin is just too damn high.  But to sum it all up, the user experience that Apple provides is simply irreplaceable. No wonder millions of people are loyal to Apple and use only their products.

['HDD VS SSD- Which one is right for you?'],"['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['September 20, 2015']",2015-09-19 19:33:59+00:00,"['People now days tend to buy notebooks rather than Desktop tower PCs. So while they do so there is a choice to either choose an HDD or an SSD Drive. There’s no straight-forward answer to the question which one to buy; each buyer has different needs and it is their choice to evaluate the decision based on those needs, your preferences, and of course budget. So, let’s talk about what are the differences between SSD and HDD, and which one you need:  HDD drives use a rotating disk. An HDD uses magnetism to store data on a rotating platter. A read/write head floats above the spinning platter reading and writing data. The faster the platter spins, the faster an HDD can perform. Typical laptop drives today spin at either 5400 RPM (Revolutions per Minute) or 7200RPM, though some server-based platters spin at up to 15,000 RPM.  SSD drives use flash memory technology (NAND-based flash memory) that makes the drive 50% lighter than the conventional HDD drives or vibration resistant and much more reliable.\xa0 Today Most of the SSD come in the form of memory card or USB stick.\xa0Firstly, SSD forms were introduced in many notebooks and tablets in the form of PCI express or SSX. However, many manufacturers have been developing SSD for the direct replacement of traditional Hard disk. Both SSD and HDD are the same size (2.5 inches) and connect the same SATA interface.        Why SSD VS HDD was done and what was the result?  Boot Test:  SSD-based notebook boots double the time faster than the HDD-based notebook or even shutdown time.  Opening a 25 MB file:  SSD-based notebook opens the file 3 times more faster. The reason besides this is the use of flash drives by SSD Hard drives. Like the conventional hard drive which searches any file with the help of its read/write head the technology is totally different in the case of SSD, it instead relies on an embedded processor called a controller to perform a bunch of operations related to reading and writing data.  Durability Test: (Vibration Resistant Test):  Since HDD drives have a magnetic disk attached to it has less capability to resist the vibration shock. The HDD-based notebooks fail to respond approximately at around 350 Hz whereas the SSD fails after the average of 5 times more.   An HDD might be the right choice if:  -You need lots of storage capacity, up to 4TB (though SSDs are constantly narrowing this gap). -Don’t want to spend much money. -Don’t care too much about how fast computer boots up or opens programs.  An SSD is the right choice if:  -You are willing to pay for faster performance. -Don’t mind limited storage capacity or can work around that (Again, SSDs are working on this “con”).  HDDs are still the popular choice for the majority of average consumers, usually choosing the HDD as the storage option in their new computer simply due to the much cheaper cost. However, more and more consumers desire top computing performance and are opting for an SSD inside their new setup or as an upgrade to their current one. As such, SSDs are well on their way to becoming the mainstream, standard storage mechanism, especially for laptops given the advantages they present for a mobile device. That said,\xa0there will always be a market for both HDDs and SSDs. The advent of\xa0mSATA SSD devices\xa0and\xa0hybrid drives that include both SSD\xa0and HDD\xa0features\xa0is another option for consumers seeking a bit of the best of both worlds, but that’s a topic for another day!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ssd-vs-hdd-image.jpg']

Put your hearings aside and take a look at Canon’s new camera technology. Canon has recently announced that it has developed a new imaging sensor format which is capable of capturing 125 times Full HD and around 30 times the 4k resolution. That counts around 250 megapixel.  The sensor is so powerful that it can capture image which is extremely far from us. When the engineers of Canon tested the sensor, they were able to capture the image where they could read the letter of an airplane flying about 18 kilometers away.         A normal Canon DSLR camera has a sensor of APS-C format, while other professional camera have full-frame sensor. This new technology uses APS-H sensor format which is bigger than APS-C format but still smaller than the full-frame sensor. That means it can still fit in DSLR camera. Canon has claimed that the 250 megapixel will consist of world’s highest number of pixels i.e. 19580*12600 pixels. It has said that it is currently developing this technology for surveillance and crime prevention tools. We hope to see it in DSLR cameras as well in the future.']",[]

['Huawei P8 Lite Review'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['September 1, 2015']",2015-09-01 14:56:07+00:00,"['Recently, Huawei launched the budget friendly P8 Lite in Nepal for Rs.28,999. As the name suggests, Huawei P8 Lite is a mid-range version of the flagship P8. The P8 Lite has some astounding specs But how does the phone perform in the real world? Let us find out in this review.   Design  Huawei P8 Lite features the same design language as the company’s flagship. However, the P8 Lite swaps out the premium metal outfit of the flagship in favor of plastic one, which is what you get these days in a midrange devices. Having said that, the plastic body on this phone doesn’t feel cheap like other plastic body phones from Samsung and Micromax. The plastic material on the back of this device has a nice hairline finish that shields the back from scratches and the display is also protected by a corning gorilla glass 3.         In terms of ergonomics, the device feels very light obviously because of all the plastic that is being used. At first impression, it might feel uncomfortable to hold in your hand, but you will get used to as the time passes. The left side of the phone is clean, while the right side houses a volume button, power button, a hybrid slot that can be either be used as a SIM card slot or a microSD expansion slot.  The second slot is for 4G SIM. The buttons are laid out conveniently and it\xa0is easily reachable with one hand. The buttons are also quite responsive. Over the top, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack and a noise canceling microphone.  On the bottom, there is a micro USB port, a single speaker, and a microphone. On the front of the display is a 5 MP front-facing camera and a notification LED, with the Huawei branding in a rather weird position below the screen.  My opinion of the P8 Lite’s design and build quality is inspiring. It is easily one of the best-looking smartphones in its price range.  Display:   P8 Lite offers a 5 inch 720P IPS display resulting in a decent pixel density of 294PPI. The screen is protected by a corning gorilla glass 3 which will help the display from minor scratches and drops. Despite the ever growing presence of 1080P displays in midrange smartphones, the 720P display on the P8 Lite still manages to produce enough detail and sharpness.   However, There are 2 notable weaknesses with the display of P8 lite: Firstly, the screen radiates a cold color temperature that inclines to have inaccurate color reproduction. Secondly, the display is quite dim, and normally you have to keep\xa0the brightness at 100% to use it comfortably. Despite inaccurate color reproduction and dimness, the display touch sensitivity is good overall.  \xa0 Software UI:  I have never thought that I would say this: The Software UI on the P8 Lite is freaking awesome. It runs on Android Lollipop 5.0 with Emotion UI 3.1 layered on top of it. The UI has taken some inspiration from iOS 8. Obviously, there is no app drawer and you need to manage all your apps on the home screen, but the UI offers so much. I have always complained about the system UI on Huawei smartphones, but the new Emotion UI completely changes the perspective on how you use your android phone.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Lock Screen (EMUI 3.1)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Home Screen (EMUI 3.1)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Notifications and Settings (EMUI 3.1)  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Lollipop, Multitasking, and Themes   \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0Dialer and Music   \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Simple UI and Power Saving Features   \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Display Color Edit, Motion Control and One hand UI   Performance:   Under the hood, P8 Lite packs Huawei’s in-house octa-core Kirin 620 processor, clocked at 1.5 GHz, and is backed by MALI400 MP4 GPU and 2 GB of RAM. Users might be skeptical with the unfamiliarity of this processor as users like is to have a Qualcomm chipset on their phone. But to be candid, the Kirin 620 processor has proven to be quite an able performer. There is hardly any noticeable lag. The overall experience is fluid, and the UI was fast and responsive.    As far as heating is concerned, the phone heats up exponentially when you are using mobile data and while playing high-end games. The Cortex A53 64 bit cores coupled with MALI 400MP4 GPU is able to cope with most of the high-end games, although at medium settings.  Camera :  The P8 Lite features a 13 MP rear camera with a f/2.2 aperture with BSI, and an LED flash. I have mixed feelings regarding the camera. On the positive note, it can capture quality outdoor photos with accurate color reproduction and details. However, the phone suffers a lot during low light condition. Even with the help of flash, the picture is not aspiring as during the daylight.  The camera app looks very similar to the one seen on iOS 8. It’s simple and hence effective. It has different modes like HDR, All-Focus Mode, and a beauty mode.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0EMUI 3.1 Camera Interface   The front-facing 5 MP camera is rather disappointing. There are so many phones these days with really good front snapper for eg. The Samsung Galaxy J7 features a wide angle lens with LED flash, but that’s not the case with the P8 lite front snapper. The 5MP camera on the P8 lite is just mediocre and there is no wide angle lens too.  MULTIMEDIA:   The audio on the P8 Lite is really astonishing. Audio output through its mono speaker reaches a whopping 79 dB and is louder than other mid-range phones.  BATTERY:  P8 features a 2200mAh non-removable battery and in real world usage, you should be able to a full day on mediocre usage.\xa0 On papers, 2200 mAh battery might not look promising, but surprisingly the battery life is great thanks to a lower resolution 720P screen and less powerful Cortex A53 CPUs.  Verdict:   Overall, I really liked this phone. Apart from the display which is a bit dim in my opinion and not so good selfie camera, all the other aspects like design, build, performance and battery life are top notch. If you are looking for a smartphone at around Rs. 26,000-Rs.27,000 price bracket then you should consider this phone.

['OPINION: The real issue while buying smartphones from Hotdeals Nepal'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['August 24, 2015']",2015-08-24 03:30:20+00:00,"['When I\xa0first heard about  Hotdealsnepal , I was elated by the objectives that the company possessed which is to sell gadgets that officially never launches in Nepal. It was a great news for tech enthusiasts who were looking to buy smartphones of sheer quality at an affordable price.  I was looking for a mid-range smartphone for my mom and luckily there was hotdealsnepal.com selling Xiaomi redmi 2 which we all know is a fantastic value for money smartphone. I browsed through their website and tried to place an order. I was bemused by the order form since there were no payment portals like eSewa or SCT moco. So, I called them to know about the payment process.  After a numerous try, I was able to contact them via phone. They said there is a cash on delivery option for the payment and will take 1 week for the delivery. So, I was left with no option other than to wait for 1 week and on the 8th day I was eagerly waiting for their phone call. 10 days passed and still no feedback from them. I asked one of my friend who once ordered a One Plus One and he had the exact same scenario. Moreover, after you buy the handset from them, there will be no after sales service. If by any chance, if your smartphone gets damaged, you will have to pay a hefty amount to get it repaired.        We are also hearing complaints from the customers that the product they receive is not seal packed. There are numerous complaints from the customers, but the one that annoys me a lot is the time taken by the company to deliver the product once the order is placed. If you are looking to buy a smartphone, you cannot wait for 10-15 days. Even if you are patience enough to wait for that long, hotdealsnepal should provide constant updates during the\xa0interval to assure the customer\xa0that their product is arriving. Otherwise, the customer will end up buying a product from offline stores.  One of our followers bought Xiaomi Mi3 from HOTDEALS Nepal and received a damaged piece. After returning the product for replacement a month ago, he hasn’t received it yet. Moreover, there has been no response from them.   Having said that, I really hope Hotdeals Nepal will rectify these mistakes in the future if they dream of becoming Nepal’s biggest and possibly best online retail shop.']",[]

With all this competition going on in the smartphone market, every manufacturer is stepping up its game trying to come up with something innovative. Today Huawei launched the  Honor 7i  which is a uniquely designed phoned with a rotating camera and a fingerprint sensor on the side. Well rotating camera is not a new concept; we’ve seen this on  Oppo N3  and the less known  iBall Andi Avonte 5 .   But what’s unique about its rotating camera module is that its lens are protected with sapphire so you won’t have to worry about any scratches, under that sapphire protection you’ll find 13MP camera sensor(4208 x 3120 pixels) with f/2.0 aperture. Also the dual LED is embedded on the rotating module which makes it a great phone for selfies as well. Did you know Huawei trademarked the word  “Groufie” ? Well with the 7i’s 28mm wide angel lens you’re all set for some memorable groufie.         This phone is not a flagship by any means. Apart from the camera; other specs are pretty decent. It bears a  Snapdragon 616 Chipset , Adreno 405 GPU and 2/3 GB of RAM based on the internal storage.   Huawei Device Nepal  has launched almost every phone Huawei has to offer, not to mention it’s killer flagship the Huawei P8 just a month back.

['Huawei P8 Review ~ Price in Nepal'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['August 20, 2015']",2015-08-20 15:53:12+00:00,"['Huawei seems to be pushing itself on making more premium phones these days as competition is getting tough on the high-end market. This year Huawei has raised the bar even higher with the launch of the new P8 smartphone. The P-series targets the higher-end market through more robust and premium build quality, but can it compete with the likes of galaxy S6 and other high-end phones? Let’s find out on our review.   PRICING  Huawei P8 is priced at Rs.60,000, but you can easily get it for around Rs.58,000 in markets. This is indeed the cheapest Flagship smartphone compared to other high end phones that are currently available in Nepal. The Samsung Galaxy S6 is priced at Rs.77,900 while the iPhone 6 is priced at Rs.82,199.        Contact and Location Details of Service Centre of Huawei Smartphone in Nepal  BUILD & DESIGN  The first impression you’ll have of this phone is when you hold it in your hands. Picking up this phone will give you that premium feel right enough to assure where you’re pouring all that money into. \xa0the phone is really light. It weighs around just 144g and it’s also one of the thinnest phones you’ll find right now with a thickness of just 6.4 mm which makes it thinner than the iPhone 6 and the Samsung galaxy s6.   Despite being a 5.2inch device, it is easily manageable with one hand;\xa0 big thanks to it’s thin side bezels. Besides the slim bezels, the slightly curved, chamfered edges add more beauty to this phone. Having curved edges and well polished back, this phone is quite slippery to hold. I really had a hard time getting a grip on this phone, a curved back might have helped here. The flat design of this phone makes it look different than other flagships. Huawei could have done a little bit more on the design aspect. But still no doubt the P8 looks absolutely amazing.  On top, we’ve got 8MP Front Facing Camera, led notification, speaker grill and also the sensors. On the left, we’ve got this clean chamfered edges and on the top we’ve got the standard headphone jack and a noise canceling microphone.   On the right, we’ve got the volume rockers and power button made out of metal which are really tactile and responsive. these buttons are well placed, so you won’t have any difficulty reaching it. Also, you have the trays for micro sd card and nano sim. And it’s a dual sim phone, and you don’t see much of the flagships with dual sims. On the bottom, we have the dual speakers like any other flagships today and the micro USB port. On the back, we’ve got the 13MP camera with the world’s first 4-colour RGBW imaging sensor which cuts noise in low light conditions by 78% while providing 32% higher brightness and contrast levels.  DISPLAY  P8 holds a 5.2-inch IPS-NEO Full HD 1080 x 1920 display with the pixel density of 424 ppi. The screen is also protected with corning gorilla glass 3.   Unlike other flagships P8 lacks the QHD screen or super AMOLED screen, but the IPS-NEO technology delivers brighter, sharper and more vivid images, as well as being more energy efficient.  UI/Software  The phone runs on Android Lollipop 5.0 on top of Huawei’s own Emotion UI 3.1, which will get an update to 5.0.2. Like phones from other Chinese manufacturers, you get no app drawer, everything is on the home screen. It might take a little bit of time to get used to it, managing apps in folders really help you move through the UI efficiently. We’ve also got the semi-transparent notification drawer with some shortcuts and the notification sections on the left which is quite managed with the timeline.   \xa0The UI doesn’t have a lot of tweaks like the MIUI but still it has got a bunch of little handy features. Like swiping down anywhere on the home screen gives you a search bar where you can search for apps, contacts, and messages. You can double tap from our knuckle to take a screenshot or just draw a circle from the knuckle in a clockwise direction to take a screen shot of the desired area. You also get a built-in network speed indicator. Also, you get the option to manage color temperature.   You also get a built-in system optimizer app from which you can clean the junk files or cache files, change the devices power plan\xa0(like performance, smart, ultra), you can also check which are the power intensive app on your phone and modify its permissions to save battery. You can also check the battery consumption level of each app including the system apps. You get a call and SMS blocker as well.   You can also change the theme of this device which affects your icons, fonts, wallpapers, and animations. There are seven themes to choose from and apart from that you can’t add any more themes, but you get the option to mix different aspects of each themes. You also get to choose the simple UI if you want a simpler experience with the handset and for better battery life. You get a bunch of tools you can have fun with like the magnification app and the mirror app. Like google now, Huawei has its own voice assistance named Amy, which can be triggered by using the hot word “okay emy”, you can also change the hot word to your liking. Also, you can customize the navigation bar to some extent like swapping the position of navigation buttons.   For those of you who find this phone huge and difficult to use, you can just swipe on the navigation bar on either left or right to trigger the one-handed mode. This is a really neat feature which was well thought of. Also, you get a lot\xa0of features if you explore into the settings menu.  PERFORMANCE  Under the hood, the Huawei P8 rocks its own HiSilicon Kirin 930 chipset that\xa0comprises of 4\xa0Cortex-A53 processors\xa0clocked at 2.0 GHz and another 4\xa0at 1.5 GHz.\xa0It has 3GB of RAM and Mali-T628 MP4 for high-end gaming and multitasking. Talking about multitasking, it’s a breeze to multitask on this device. You can open a bunch of apps and navigate around them without any stutter or lag.   One area where the phone suffers is while playing high-end games. The Mali-T628 MP4 GPU on the P8 is less powerful than other high-end GPUs like Adreno 450 (Oneplus 2) and Mali-T760MP8 (Samsung Galaxy S6 / Note5). Playing high-end games at high settings works fine, but the problem is it tends to get hot after a while. Overall, it has an admirable performance compared to other flagships, but Huawei still needs to improve in this area to be more competitive.  CAMERA  It’s on the camera that Huawei has undoubtedly focused most of its attention on the P8.\xa0 Camera interface resembles a lot to the iPhone’s camera UI, but Huawei has put some of its own unique touches to it. Huawei has worked a lot on the P8s camera and it has significantly one of the best cameras out there. The 13MP rear camera sensor can’t match the Galaxy S6 or One M9 for resolution, but Huawei claims the camera comes with the world’s first 4-colour RGBW imaging sensor which cuts noise in low light conditions by 78% while providing 32% higher brightness and contrast levels. You get really sharp and vivid images with its camera. It also holds the best in class OIS (optical image stabilization) and a DSLR quality ISP (image signal processor).   What does this all mean? A number of things actually, including enhanced low-light performance, brighter, more natural colors and a better auto mode which can adjust the settings accordingly to give you the best shot. You get numerous amount of camera options which you can play with. The best one is probably the light painting and the super night mode. Light painting gives you the long exposure shots of car trails or lines of light. You can really get creative with this camera. Also, in low light, it performs pretty well. Images get a bit noisy but still it’s better than images from other flagships.  Despite all the hype on Huawei’s camera, we still think there are more things that it could have offered but let don’t let that put you off it’s still a great snapper and you get pretty excellent shots with it. \xa0 Check out the Camera Samples of Huawei P8.  BATTERY  This phone packs a Non-removable Li-Po 2680 mAh battery which can last you for two days on moderate usage and a full day on heavy usage. While gaming or other heavy tasks, you get 4 hours of screen on time.  Huawei has put a lot of effort on the P8 as far as power management is concerned. With Ultra Power Saving mode and different power saving features, you will be able to\xa0improve your battery performance considerably. The only cons in the battery department is\xa0a\xa0lack of turbocharging so you’ll have to wait for about 2.5 to 3 hours to juice up completely.  CONNECTIVITY  Huawei is a rare flagship device to come with Dual SIM support, however, the second slot should either\xa0be used as\xa0MicroSD or Nano SIM. The P8 is also equipped with Cat. 6 LTE with download speed exceeding 300mbps.  In terms of Wi-Fi, the phone supports\xa0Dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, however, there is no Wi-Fi ac. Call quality is excellent on Huawei P8 thanks to its Dual Antenna technology that makes the call reception class above its competitors. Other connectivity includes\xa0Bluetooth 4.1,\xa0GPS/GLONASS, FM radio, and NFC.  VERDICT  Huawei has significantly improved on its flagship segment. The P8 has a lot to offer including a great build, great design, awesome camera performance and a decent battery life. There are merely few things you can complain about this device which includes casual heating issue while playing games thanks to its iffy chipset as well as lack of Quad HD display which could be a major setback for users looking to buy a smartphone at this price range.     PROS  CONS    -Great Build and Design  -Performance still below the level of GS6    -Great Display despite being 1080P  -Emotion UI lags sometimes    \xa0-Feature Pack Camera  \xa0-No Wireless Charging, Quick Charging, and WiFi ac']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Huawei-p8-camera.jpg']

The use of Internet services, television, applications and security solutions, wireless solutions, printing solutions, power solutions have become ubiquitous as far as tech revolution in concerned. But, displaying stalls in the name of the business policy and aiming to sell more creating offers are just not why people should go there for. The event should be more prioritized in information exchange and programs for technology development in Nepal.\xa0Personally different events such the CAN infotech, Soft Tech should be named as a conference rather than a fair.        More than 150,000 people are expected to visit the CAN Softech-2015. The entrance fee for the event is Rs. 50 for general public and Rs. 25 for students. CAN also has offered the students bringing letters from concerned colleges and schools will be offered special discounts in the spot itself.  Finally I have some points that I want Computer Association of Nepal to listen and take action in make order to improve its status like the biggest info tech events like  Mobile World Congress   MWC  or  Consumer Electronics Show CES.   Construction of the stalls  should finish before the event starts which can decrease accidental hazards and does not show the event’s Prestige.  Removal of huge speakers in the stalls and try to  make a learning environment .  Prefer to make the info tech a  place to learn and not a business trade fair . Providing knowledge to people aware people automatically help in an increase in business.  A  talk stage program  which explains all the new release or new technology launched in the event. Scheduling the talk show which can make it more effective.  A  stall map  placed in various places so that people don’t need to search for the respective stalls.

Note series from Samsung have always been bigger with some serious specs underneath, and the new Note 5 follows the same trend: It offers a huge 5.7 inch QuadHD SuperAMOLED display,\xa0a 14nm octa core Exynos 7420 system on a chip, and 4GB of RAM which is indeed Samsung ‘s first phone to have so. It also sports a new revamped 16-megapixel rear camera with Optical image stabilization, a 5-megapixel front snapper, and a storage option of 32 or 64GB.   In terms of design, Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is inspired from the Galaxy S6. The phablet features a metal frame sandwiched between two pieces of toughened gorilla glass. It comes with a slight curve on the back that makes it a bit more comfortable to hold and use the device with one hand.   However, gone are the 2 aspects because of the revamped design: No MicroSD card slot and No Removable Battery. Moreover, the device is thinner than last year’s Note 4 making it relentless to pack a smaller battery inside(3000mAh). However, Samsung claims that the battery life will be better than that of Note 4 thanks to the advancement in AMOLED technology and more power efficient Exynos chipset that’s powering the phone.  Things we liked:   Thinner, lighter, and more\xa0premium  Powerful Processor with 4GB of RAM  One of the finest Camera Smartphone  New S-pen Stylus   Things we didn’t Like:   UI looks more cartoonish  No microSD card option  No Removable battery   There has been no official announcement regarding the price tag. The pre-order should begin here in Nepal starting next week and should be available for purchase before the end of this month. So, what do you think about the Samsung’s new product?

And both these apps go beautifully hand in hand. It is currently in beta version for testing so there might be some glitches here and there.   The UI(User Interface) of the launcher looks really light and it’s smooth to use. Some user might find it difficult to use the vertical app drawer but there’s a search bar up top which makes it easier to search for apps.        You get 3 home screens and apart from that you can’t really add or remove any other home screens. The middle screen is where you’ll find the frequently used apps, on the left you get quick contacts and on the right; notes and reminder. Also if you swipe from the bottom you get another set of quick apps along with the recent contact list. You’ll also find the launcher settings there.  Since the app is in Beta, you can just change the wallpaper under the launcher settings. And you get a lot of great wallpapers which goes pretty well with this launcher.

In India, the company sold cardboard for Rs.99 on Amazon so that its fans can experience the event in 360. For those while doesn’t have cardboard can also enjoy the event live stream for the app that onePlus and released on the play store for its launch event.  Specs:  Companies typically like to keep every detail under wraps until the big unveil, but OnePlus is not your typical company.

OnePlus 2 is going to be a beast. The company teases for its next flagship phone and we know that the new OnePlus 2 will have  Snapdragon 810 processor (v2.1).  This new processor is the updated version of the processor of the same name but with upgrades. The heating problem which was seen on 810 has been fixed and the new chip supports  4k live streaming.  Also, the company teased that the phone will have 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM. The mobile will be first to use USB C type as seen first on the new MacBook.

There are still a few odds and ends, like storage, and it’s unclear how big the device’s screen will be (along with resolution). Rumors suggest fans can expect a 5.5-inch display with \xa0FullHD resolution, along with similar storage options to last year’s model, which offered 16GB and 64GB.

It took over 15 minutes for the ambulance to arrive and by then there was absolutely no chance of saving him. If a defibrillator was available within two minutes, the chances of survival would be up to 80%.

We saw the rise of Meizu with the launch of M1 Note and the M2 Note which are just mid-range phones, but when it launched the MX 4, everything changed as it was the most affordable flagship phone. And now, Meizu has revealed it’s flagship for 2015, the Meizu MX 5.   Meizu MX 5  is a beast when you look at the specs and a beauty when you perceive it’s beautiful unibody metal design. What’s really amazing about this phone is the specs it beholds, the Helio X10 64bit chipset, an octa core CPU which competes with the Snapdragon 808 CPU. And comes with 3GB RAM which is pretty standard for the flagship phone nowadays. It also offers refresh rate up to 120 GHZ so you won’t get any glitch on your display.\xa0 This phone comes with a fingerprint sensor as well. The fingerprint sensor assists in a variety of OS security functions such as unlocking the device or accessing private folders or galleries on your phone.         The device measures just 7.6mm and weighs in at 149g which is pretty thin and light for a phone with 5.5’ inch display. Talking about the display it has a 1080p display with AMOLED screen with 401ppi. So it’s a pretty bright and sharp display. It also comes with the protection of Corning Gorilla Glass 3.   Another great thing about this phone is its camera. It packs a 20MP rear camera with a Sony IMX220 sensor and dual-tone LED flash with laser autofocus. So it’s one of the best-equipped smartphone camera out there. Also, it has 5MP front camera. Meizu has also introduced the new mCharge technology, which can charge the new MX5 from 0 to 25% in just 10 minutes.

['Karbonn Mach 2 Review'],"['Karbonn', 'Reviews']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['July 1, 2015']",2015-07-01 04:42:46+00:00,"['Karbonn smartphones seemed to be out of the limelight for quite a some time. With the likes of Xiaomi, Meizu and Micromax in the market selling phones of premium quality at an affordable price, can Karbonn make a comeback with its Mach 2 smartphone (priced at Rs.18,153)? Let’s find out on our review.  Built Quality:  We must admit Karbonn Mach 2 is a very good looking phone. In fact, it is a lot identical to the iPhone 5s if you look it from the side view. The phone we got was black all the way through and it feels really premium on hand. On the front, we’ve got the 8MP front Camera, and the capacitive touch buttons on the bottom but they are not backlit which can be a turnoff for some users. On the right side of the        On the right side of the phone, we have the volume rockers and the power button which are really solid and tactile. On the top, we have the standard headphone jack and the micro USB port. There’s nothing on the left side. And on the bottom we have dual speakers which sound pretty okay, you can’t complain much about a budget phone. On the back, there’s the 8MP rear camera with dual flash and the Karbonn branding.  The back of the phone is also protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 like in the front. We can clearly see how much effort Karbonn has put on the build of this phone and without a doubt this is the best looking Karbonn phone till date.    Display:     Talking about the display of this phone, it’s a 720p HD display and it produces really sharp and vibrant colors. Viewing angles are great and you get a pretty good outdoor visibility. There’s nothing so special about this screen, it just looks nice. And one think I have to mention about the display is that it’s really really smooth, but we’ve been facing some touch issues during our use. It seems like a minor bug which could be solved by a software update. And yes! This phone would be getting a software update to the Android lollipop.  Performance:  Talking about the performance of this phone, it sports a 1.4GHz Mediatek Octacore MT6592 CPU and 1GB of RAM. Which in our experience performed really well. Multitasking was okay in this device. You could do your everyday regular stuff easily with this device. Also, you can play high-end games in medium settings and other casual games with a breeze. And like you may have already guessed this phone has some heating issues as it uses a Mediatek chipset. Device tends to get hot near the camera section while playing games, so you might have to leave the device to take some air once in a while if you play heavy games otherwise there won’t be any heating issues.   Camera:  So this phone comes with a dual 8Mp camera on back and front. It might look good on the specs sheet, but this is where we were really disappointed with this phone. It takes really decent and saturated photos from the back camera, images tend to get grainy if the lighting conditions are just slightly off. And the front camera is even more disappointing, you get pretty grainy and dark pictures like the rear camera. But in good light it takes really good pictures though the images produced seemed a bit washed off. By far, we this is the worst 8MP shooter we have seen.  Battery:  And the battery is yet another thing that bothers us about this phone. It packs just 1900mAH of battery and it’s terrible. Manufacturers are sacrificing battery in almost every device nowadays for the sake of design and thinness of the phone. And as you might have notice it’s a sleek phone and battery has been terribly compromised here. With normal usage, you might hardly get a day of usage and if you check your phone regularly you might have to grab a charger few times a day.  Connectivity:  Talking about the connectivity of this phone, it comes with dual micro Sim with 3G support. The phone also comes with Wi-Fi, Hotspot, and GPS. All the connectivity works perfectly fine on this phone, and you will not have any problems with that. Also we made some calls through this phone and it worked just fine, signals were good, call quality was nice.  Verdict:     And once again this is the best looking phone Karbonn has designed till date. You’ll just love holding this device and looking at it. Apart from the design aspect we don’t see anything special going around with this phone. We really appreciate the design, but the camera of this phone is bad, not to mention its average performance, they could have got a snapdragon 400 or 410 chipset which is a standard for the device at this price point, also the audio is just fine for dual speakers. Everything is just mediocre, except the design and built quality. If you’re looking for a really good looking phone with the best protection you could get, this is the phone for you in a budget, that won’t hurt your pocket. To summarize, here are the pros and cons of the smartphone.  PROS   Best Looking phone at this price  Good Display   CONS   Mediocre camera  Touch issues  Below average Battery life']",[]

Hopefully, this will be true because everyone wants to see MotoG finally having 2GB of RAM.

['3 New Flagship Smartphones Coming to Nepal soon'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['June 28, 2015']",2015-06-28 02:42:44+00:00,"['We have already seen flagship phones from Samsung i.e. the  Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge \xa0launched in Nepal, but apart from that other smartphone brands are yet to unveil their flagship phones of 2015. Things are finally getting back to normal after the devastating earthquake of April 25 and now we expect new phones to be announced in Nepal soon. Here we round up 3 of the best new phones\xa0that are soon to be announced in Nepal. So, Let’s start:  1. LG G4   LG ‘s previous flagships G2 and G3 did well in the Nepali market, and we expect the same with the G4. LG has emphasized more on its Camera specification in the G4 more and touts its performance as a professional-grade DSLR. The phone comes with 16 megapixel 1/2.6-inch CMOS sensor with F1.8 aperture lens. The phone now sports an improved optical image stabilization system with 3 axes. In addition, the G4 comes with laser AF for better focus and a new color spectrum sensor that reads RGB color and Infrared in order to recognize objects in a scene and their color. The raw data is then processed to optimize white balance and color processing. At the front, LG has opted for an 8MP sensor combined with an F2.0 aperture.   In terms of Display, LG G4 has a new IPS Quantum Quad HD display, which is quite similar, yet better than G3. There is a slightly unusual processor inside the LG G4- the hexacore Snapdragon 808 processor with 4 Cortex A53 Cores and 2 Cortex A57. Obviously, this processor is less powerful than the latest Octa Core Snapdragon 810 seen in the HTC one M9 or the Exynos 7420 of the Samsung Galaxy S6, but LG says the hexacore processor is destined to save more power and will give better battery life. The phone boasts a 3000 mAh battery which can be removed as well. The body of the G4 is slightly curved, nothing like the G flex 2, but the curved design means it’s easier to grab in the hands. The G4 runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop operating system with the new human-centric UX 4.0.         2. Huawei P8 and P8 max  Huawei unveiled two of its new flagship smartphones, the P8 and the P8 Max at its global launch event in London on April 16. Both these phones are already available in most markets. Lately, Ascend Series from Huawei has not been able to compete with other flagship but the Huawei P8 is a flagship smartphone worthy of some attention.  Talking about the Huawei P8, hardware-wise, it offers a frameless 5.2-inch full HD display and a 4-colour (RGBW) 13-megapixel camera with OIS and dual flash along with an 8MP selfie camera. Under the hood is an octa-core chipset using Kirin 930 64-bit processor along with 3GB of RAM. P8 carries a huge 2,680 mAh battery on a very thin body.  The phone is just 6.4-millimetres thick and weighs just 144 grams. The P8 runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box, with Huawei’s EMUI 3.1 on top.\xa0 The handset will be offered in Champagne Silver, Gold, Grey, and Black. The standard version of the P8 is due to go on sale in more than 30 countries priced at €499 (16GB storage), or there’s a ‘premium’ version (64GB storage) that will cost €599.  The larger version of the P8 is the p8 max phablet, which rocks an incredible 6.8-inch full HD display and a huge 4,360mAh battery. It also has 3GB of RAM like the p8. While the screen might sound pretty huge but the P8max is only 6.8mm thick and weighs in at 228 grams.  The P8 Max also runs on Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box, with Huawei’s EMUI 3.1 on top.\xa0 The handset will be offered in Champagne Silver, Gold, Grey, and Black. The standard version (32GB) of P8 Max will cost €549\xa0while the premium (64GB) will cost €649.  3. Gionee Elife E8  Gionee, the Chinese mobile phone manufacturer, is set to announce Elife E8 in Nepal. It is company’s flagship phone of 2015 and offers new high-end specs which we all have been waiting to see since the launch of Elife E7 back in 2013.  The major attraction about the Elife E8 is its 23.7 MP rear camera, which is able to produce photographs up to 120 megapixels in resolution. And it will also be the first Android smartphone to offer lossless zoom. The camera app launches in just 0.8 seconds and using a phase-detection autofocus system, Gionee claims the Elife E8 focuses in 0.08s to 0.2s. The camera sensor is also equipped with optical image stabilization, which corrects shakes up to 1.5 degrees in angle.

['Hands On: Karbonn Mach 2'],['Karbonn'],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['June 26, 2015']",2015-06-26 11:08:21+00:00,"['Indian smartphone brand Karbonn recently announced a mid-range phone  Titanium Mach 2  in Nepal for Rs.18,153. Karbonn has certainly made a huge effort to improve the design of their latest phone Mach 2 as it features a very sleek and sexy looking build. The smartphone measures 6.3mm in thickness and comes with Gorilla Glass 3 on both sides. In addition to being slim, it’s very light weighing only 112g.  The phone comes with 2 micro-SIM card slots and a memory card slot that is expandable up to 32GB.  At first impression, I was stunned by the design and looks of the smartphone, especially considering the price tag of mere Rs. 18,153 (Note: You should get it under Rs.16,500 in retail stores).\xa0Needless to say this, but Karbonn Mach 2 is perhaps the best looking phone the company has ever launched.  The power button along with volume buttons is located on the left side.  The smartphone has a 5-inch HD IPS display, which is vivid and sharp. The display shows you Karbonn’s heavily customized User Interface. We played some few videos on the device and they looked okay. However, it’ll be fair to comment more on the display once we put it to the test in our detailed review.         The Karbonn Titanium Mach 2 features an octa core processor, albeit it’s a MediaTek processor (MT6592 Octacore @1.4GHz) which might be a turn-off to many tech enthusiasts. We didn’t have any performance issues during our hands-on time. The UI was fast and snappy and the processor was able to handle most of the multi-tasking. The phone comes with 8GB of expandable memory and 1GB of RAM. We will analyze the performance in detail as soon we get a review unit.  The Karbonn Titanium Mach 2 has 8MP rear and front camera. On paper, the camera specifications seem to be decent, but when I clicked some photos, I instantly realised the drawback of this phone. The back camera is mediocre, but can capture good photos in daylight and HDR mode., but the front camera is the worst I have seen in a while. Although it is equipped with an 8MP sensor, the front snapper lacks all the elements that should be present in a front-facing selfie cam.   One area I am little worried about is its battery life. The phone packs a 1900 mAh battery and has to power a 720P display and Octacore processor. During my hands-on time, I felt like the battery was draining faster than it normally should.  EARLY VERDICT:\xa0  I really liked the design and build of the phone, but at the same time I was concerned with the overall hardware specs the phone comes with. It features MediaTek CPU coupled with a mediocre camera\xa0and a small battery capacity. Here are the pros and cons of the phone:      PROS  CONS    -Spectacular design  -Poor Front camera    -Good Screen  -Mediocre Battery Life      So, what do you think about the new Karbonn Mach 2?

If it wasn’t for the SEO titles and meta keywords, the headline of the Honor 4x launch story in Nepal should be something like Huawei Device Nepal launches the most overpriced smartphone of the year. The price tag of NPR. 26,999 doesn’t make any sense, especially when you consider the fact that it is priced at INR. 9,999 (~NPR.16,000) in India. (update: Honor 4x price now in Nepal: Rs. 22,999)  Huawei Honor 4x Pricing Strategy  Huawei has exacerbated their pricing strategy in Nepal for a while now. Last month, they launched  Gplay mini  for NPR. 19,999 which is identical to Honor 4C priced in India at INR.7,999. No matter what way you look at it, newly launched phones from Huawei here in Nepal can’t justify its price.  Huawei Honor 4x, Lets Talk About It  It boasts a 5.5 inch (1280 x 720 pixels) HD IPS display, is powered by 1.2 GHz Huawei Kirin 620 64-bit A53 Octa-core processor and runs on Android 4.4 (Kitkat) with Emotion UI 3.0. In terms of memory, the phone has 2GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable memory. It has a 13-megapixel rear camera with LED flash and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. It has dual SIM support and 4G connectivity and packs a 3000 mAh battery.        BUILD:  The  Huawei Honor 4x  sports a plastic body with a textile finish on the back. It weighs 165gms and measures 152.9mm × 77.2mm × 8.65mm in dimension. Honor 4x lies in a phablet category because of its 5.5-inch display. It’s a big phone and performing with one hand is next to impossible.  DISPLAY:  Honor 4x comes with a big 5.5-inch display. The IPS panel is bright, produces accurate color and has decent viewing angle. It’s perfect for watching movies and playing games. The display lacks a gorilla glass protection, so its highly recommended to have a scratch protection cover.  Honor 4x screen quality is better and brighter than Huawei Gplay mini–the phone that was launched a couple of months ago for NPR. 19,999. However, both these phones are a fingerprint and smudge magnet.  CAMERA:  Like the Gplay mini, Honor 4x comes with 13/5MP cameras. The 13MP rear camera\xa0has a minimal interface and looks quite similar to the one seen in iPhone 6/6 Plus.\xa0The image quality of the 13MP rear camera of Honor 4x is just mediocre, lacking sharpness and color accuracy. The 5MP front camera, on the other hand, is good for selfies and video chatting.  PERFORMANCE:  Honor 4x is equipped with Huawei’s in-house Kirin 620 chipset with an Octa-core 1.2Ghz Cortex A53 64 bit processor supplemented by 2GB of DDR3 RAM. The Kirin 620 Chipset is somewhat similar to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 615 chipset seen on Micromax Yureka Yu, HTC desire 820 and Xiaomi Mi4i. Under normal usage like browsing, chatting,etc., the phone is deprived\xa0of any lags. The phone runs smoothly while multi-tasking or switching between apps. We will be able to tell you more about its performance(gaming and benchmark) once we review this phone.  BATTERY:  Honor 4x is equipped with 3000 mAh battery, slightly bigger than most other mid-range Huawei\xa0smartphones. The 3000 mAh battery should provide enough life to last for a day of moderate usage.  CONNECTIVITY:  Honor 4x has two micro\xa0SIM card slots and supports 4G LTE connectivity. The phone also comes with WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS.  Early Verdict:  Had the price of this phone been somewhere near NPR. 20,000, It would have made sense. But, at NPR. 26,999, it’s too much what Huawei are asking for. At this price range, you can get Xiaomi Mi4i, or Asus Zenfone 2 which are equipped with a FullHD screen, superior hardware specs, and better camera performance.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Honor-4X-1.jpg']

It comes with a traditional 8MP rear camera with LED flash and 1080P video recording.         The screen isn’t the best we have seen on a midrange phone. It only features a qHD display (not QHD).

Under similar pricing, you could get the Colors Elite E15 and Huawei Y6 that comes with HD display.\xa0However, the 5MP front camera of this phone is a well-padded benefit.

From our fathers to grandfathers everyone knew Nokia and used one of its handsets. It was one of the most important brands in the world till it failed to catch up with the latest trends in the smartphone industry and before it was too late Nokia went bankrupt and was sold to Microsoft. From a glorious past to a shameful end, we must admit it was hard to go down like this. The name it had built and the reputation it has earned went all in ruins. And now in 2016 Nokia is planning to come back hoping to make a place in the smartphone market again which it has completely lost not so long ago.   Nokia chief executive Rajeev Suri confirmed that Nokia will return to designing and licensing its own phones. The CEO said, “Microsoft makes mobile phones. We would simply design them and then make the brand name available to license.” Nokia did the same licensing of its name for the\xa0Nokia N1 Android tablet which was a mild success. Microsoft has restricted Nokia from selling phones under its brand name until the third quarter of 2016. And on the 4 th  quarter of 2016 we’re sure to see a launch of Nokia device or devices. These devices are likely to be mid-range and would follow the Nokia’s build concept with some minor improvements. But we’re still unsure if the devices will be running on android or windows. Nokia could be working on an OS of its own like the Symbian. Rumors stat that Nokia has been working on not only phones but also tablets and virtual reality. We may soon observe the rise of Nokia once more, for that we’ll just have to wait and watch.         So this is a big news in the smartphones market, as one of the oldest tech giant is returning back to the game and with pretty serious motive and improvements. We’re sure that Nokia won’t let us down with it’s come back with the latest line-up of Nokia products. People haven’t lost faith in Nokia yet so there’s still a pretty good chance that Nokia will survive in the smartphone market.  [fbcomments]']",[]

Actually, it’s not!  A security flaw in the SwiftKey keyboards pre-installed on Samsung smartphones is leaving at least 600 million devices vulnerable to hackers including the new Samsung Galaxy S6. The exploit was recently demonstrated at the Black Hat security conference in London by Ryan Welton, a researcher with security firm NowSecure.\xa0NowSecure, found that the pre-installed SwiftKey app can be tricked to download language pack updates over a unencrypted connection in plain text. Thus in the presence of language packs, malicious code can be injected to take control of the smartphone.  The flaw allows a hacker to remotely: 1) Access sensors and resources like GPS, camera and microphone. 2) Secretly install a malicious app(s) without the user knowing. 3) Tamper with how other apps work or how the phone works. 4) Eavesdrop on incoming/outgoing messages or voice calls. 5) Give an attempt to access sensitive personal data like pictures and text messages.        And the scary thing is hackers can exploit the vulnerability even when the SwiftKeykeyboard is not used as the default keyboard.   There are millions of Samsung devices with SwiftKey keyboard, still vulnerable via this loophole. The list of affected devices includes Galaxy S6, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S4 Mini, however, NowSecure cautions that this is not an all-inclusive list of impacted devices.   There is no way one can uninstall SwiftKey from the Samsung’s Galaxy range of devices since the app has been whitelisted and deemed to be native. The keyboard which cannot be disabled or uninstalled allows hackers easy access to users’ devices. However,\xa0you can always remove a system app simply by rooting your device. If you don’t want to root your device wait till there is a patch released for the Samsung phones. If you own a Samsung device and are concerned about this bug, NowSecure advises that you do not use insecure Wi-Fi networks and do not update your language packages in the mean time.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/samsung-galaxy-s6.jpg']

Not only from the tech point of view but also from the point of humanity. We can see the Microsoft’s sane intentions with the start of Project Premonition. Project Premonition, a system that aims to detect infectious disease outbreaks before they become widespread, with the goal of preventing major health disasters. Microsoft researchers are working with academic partners across multiple disciplines to develop the system, which collects and analyzes mosquitoes to look for early signs that potentially harmful diseases are spreading.   For the Project Premonition in action, drones play an important role. Drones that can fly the mosquito traps into and out of remote areas in a semi-autonomous way, rather than having to be constantly directed from the ground. Microsoft researchers are developing ways to make the drones more autonomous. It may sound like the stuff of blockbuster movies, but Project Premonition aims to be fact, not fiction.         Project Premonition\xa0seeks to detect pathogens in animals before these pathogens make people sick. It does this by treating a\xa0mosquito as a device\xa0that can find animals and sample their blood. Project Premonition uses drones and new robotic mosquito traps to capture many more mosquitoes from the environment than previously possible and then analyzes their body contents for pathogens. Pathogens are detected by\xa0gene sequencing\xa0collected mosquitoes and computationally searching for known and unknown pathogens in the sequenced genetic material.   Usually, health officials only find out about an outbreak once people are already getting sick. This means things like vaccines and health clinics may not be up and running for as long as a couple of months after a disease has begun spreading. Project Premonition could eventually allow health officials to get a jump start on preventing outbreaks of a disease like dengue fever or avian flu before it occurs, whether or not it is a disease spread by mosquitoes, researchers said.\xa0The ability to predict an epidemic would be huge and could save a lot of lives. But this project is far from over, it could possibly take few years before it’s complete. It is a huge step in the field of medical sciences and robotics. Looking at this project one can only predict what we can behold in the future.   Source:  via']",[]

The facial recognition is dead on, too: In our testing, there were no random mismatched faces and share suggestions in Moments.You can toggle specific photos from the generated gallery, as well, so if you want to sync some of them and keep the others from a friend’s clutches, you can.         \xa0  The app’s default setting is to create a private album that can be used for sharing the discovered image or images simply with those pictured in them. The idea is that the privately shared album grows organically as both people continue to share new photos through it. Moments arranges the photos on your phone into groups, all based on when they were taken—like at a wedding, or a weekend getaway. “Facebook’s facial recognition tech can identify which of your friends are in the photos, and you can privately send those photos to specific friends in the shot.”  Although the app is exclusively available for USA only at the time, Facebook is planning for global launch of this app very soon.

"['Understanding RAM, ROM, and Flash Memory']","['Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By GadgetByte -  '],"['June 16, 2015']",2015-06-15 22:15:48+00:00,"['We easily get confused between ROM, RAM, and Flash Memory. \xa0Here is a short explanation what are they.  ROM (Read Only Memory)  This type of memory is non-volatile which means if there is no power source the content is not lost. We can compare this to a human brain. A human brain may contain many contents, but when sleeping we don’t have access to the information stored in the brain.\xa0Computers and smartphones contain\xa0a small amount of ROM that stores firmware and critical programs that boot\xa0the device.        In smartphones, ROM is also referred as an internal memory. All your default apps and firmware are installed in the ROM. If your smartphone has 8GB of internal memory, you will only be able to use around 5GB since the remaining 3GB is being occupied by your firmware and default apps.  ROM (Read Only Memory)  ROMs are used in flashing/installing a new version of firmware. For eg. you often hear about flashing a new ROM; it means you are flashing a new version of the firmware onto your smartphone. If your smartphone is currently running Kitkat, you can flash your ROM and install a new version of the Android version i.e Lollipop (if there is an official firmware for the desired smartphone).  If there is no official firmware for your smartphone, you can still install the latest firmware thanks to the different independent organizations that develops custom ROMs. A custom ROM might have performance tweaks, new features such as overclocking and so on.  Read more.  RAM (Random Access Memory)  Unlike ROM, RAM does both reading and writing. It is much faster than the ROM. It is volatile which means it will lose all its data when the power source is removed. You can think ROM as a speed reader, they can do the given task very quickly but it will forget everything when the power source is cut.  RAM plays an important role when it comes to the performance of your smartphone and computer.\xa0The more RAM you have, the more programs you can fit in memory. Hence, more RAM is good for multitasking. Since there are so many apps running in the background, and we want to switch between apps as fast as possible, you want your smartphone and PC to have as much RAM as possible.  RAM (Read Only Memory)  Normally, an average user should have 1GB of RAM on their smartphone, and 2GB of RAM on their PC. But, if you are tech savvy as I am and often get involved in high-end applications, intense gaming, and multimedia work, then i recommend you to have at least 2GB of RAM on your smartphone and 8GB of RAM on your PC.  But, again RAM is not only the factor that decides the performance of your device. Processors play an equal role in determining the performance of your device.  Flash Memory:  Flash Memory are the USB stick that people carry. It is used transfer files from one end to another. It has both RAM and ROM inside it. It can read the content very quickly, but processing is slow. So we can’t expect it to replace standard computer memory.  Flash Drive [fbcomments]']",[]

['What to expect from the next OnePlus Two smartphone'],['OnePlus'],['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['June 14, 2015']",2015-06-14 12:06:39+00:00,"['Lately, we have been hearing lots of rumors about the successor of OnePlus One, the OnePlus Two, that is creating a lot of buzz in the technology market. Questions have been raised if it will be as good as the OnePlus one and will the price be considerably affordable.  Read here:\xa0 OnePlus Two Smartphone Price in Nepal  Well, wait no further, looking at the latest leaks and rumors we have got some ideas how OnePlus Two will be like and what will it pack in its specs. Reports out of China suggests the OnePlus Two will be priced at 2,000 Yuan ($322), which is slightly more than the OnePlus One’s original launch price of $300. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau told followers on the Weibo social network the OnePlus Two will use the  Qualcomm Snapdragon 810  processor.         The prospect of using a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset may be filled with consternation for some users because of its poor thermal performance in other flagship phones like the HTC One M9, but\xa0OnePlus Two is said to feature ‘improved’ Qualcomm 810 chip’  “We worked very closely with Qualcomm’s engineers to integrate an improved version of the chipset (v2.1) in the OnePlus 2, and fine-tuned both hardware and software. The 2 will be ‘cooler than ever’.”  The octa core processor was accompanied by 4GB of RAM, and the device used Android 5.1 as its operating system and it is definitely that it’ll come with the latest version of Oxygen OS running. Also, some official sources have listed that OnePlus Two will sport 5.5 inch screen with the resolution at 2560 x 1440 pixels which is a QHD display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. It will be available in different variants based on the storage capacities like the OnePlus One. Rumours also states it will be equipped with 16MP Rear Camera with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), and 5 MP Front Camera. It will definitely have a larger battery for the QHD screen of about 3300mAh.  The OnePlus Two is also expected to come with a laser focus fingerprint identification system embedded in the home button.\xa0OnePlus says the fingerprint scanner will give you the ability to store up to five fingerprint profiles, making it\xa0much easier to access your smartphone no matter which finger you’d like to use.  On the OnePlus 2, one quick tap takes you right to your homescreen. With the ability to store up to five fingerprint profiles, it’s fast, it’s safe, and it’s secure. Your smartphone is your most personal device, and its security should be personal, too.  In the meantime, OnePlus said it’s focused on creating the OnePlus Two so that sufficient numbers of the device will be available ahead of the projected 2015 launch. It is expected to launch in late July. Unfortunately, OnePlus said that it will probably use the invite system for its next smartphone too, before moving on to limited pre-orders again. “It will probably be invite-only for a short period of time, after which pre-orders are rolled out” OnePlus stated.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/OP_s02_c014-scaled.jpg']

Ltd., the authorized distributor of Karbonn smartphones in Nepal, has officially announced a new smartphone named  Titanium Mach One  for NRP. 13,649. It is available in different smartphone retail stores all across Nepal.  Karbonn Mach One is a midrange Android-based smartphone that comes with a 4.7 inch HD IPS touch-screen with a resolution of 1280×720 pixels resulting in a respectable pixel density of 312 ppi. The screen is protected by a Gorilla Glass 3 and is scratch proof to some extent.  Karbonn Mach One  Under the hood, the phone is powered by a\xa0quad-core processor manufactured by Mediatek. The processor has 4 Cortex A7 cores, all running at a frequency of 1.3GHz. We should expect decent multitasking performance with these 4 cores, but since the processor is manufactured by Mediatek and is build on cortex A7 architecture, you should expect lags and occasional stuttering while playing graphically intensifying games. The phone has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of inbuilt storage. The phone memory can be further expanded thanks to a microSD card slot up to 32GB.        For photography, it comes with an 8MP camera with LED flash and BSI II Sensor. The camera is mediocre, lacking in both details and color reproduction. The secondary camera, however, can capture really good photos since it is equipped with a 5MP sensor.  The Karbonn Titanium Mach One still runs an outdated Android version in KitKat 4.4, but soon will be getting Lollipop update. The phone packs an 1800mAh battery.

Although the maximum retail price of the phone is Rs.13,469, you should get it for around Rs.12,000 in Nepal. What I really liked about this phone is its build quality. As far as the performance of this phone is concerned, it can handle normal tasks quite well and should not bother you a lot if you are not into hardcore gaming. The battery life is good, but not excellent. The rear camera is pretty average like most of the sub-15K phones, however, the 5MP snapper up front also has a flash and performs well. To sum it up–it’s a good buy.      PROS  CONS    -Good Build quality  -Screen not bright    -Excellent Front camera  -Mediocre Back camera']",[]

I have been using this handset for almost 2 months, and many of you have been asking me on whether\xa0Huawei\xa0G play mini stands out to be the best phone to buy for NRs.20,000. Well, let’s find out in this article.  Huawei Gplay mini looks identical to Honor 4c  More About Huawei G Play Mini  At a first glance at the specs, you will notice that the\xa0Huawei G play mini specs look identical to Honor 4c— the phone that was\xa0launched in India for INR 8,999 (NRs.14,400). So, you might want to know why are we paying more for the phone with almost same specs? Huawei Device Nepal says that Huawei Honor 4c and Huawei G play mini are different phones with Huawei G play mini sporting a superior design better suited for gaming. But, after some research and comparison, it turns out Gplay mini and Honor 4c has almost similar design.\xa0 So, why is the Honor 4c cheaper? The main reason is that there is too much competition going on in Indian smartphone market with the likes of Xiaomi Redmi 2 and Micromax Yuphoria\xa0providing decent phones under INR 10K. But, unfortunately, that’s not the case here in Nepal.  Moving on… I actually bought Gplay mini for Rs.18,500 and also got a free screen guard and an egregious flip cover\xa0that will only make your phone look ugly. The box content comprises of a wall charger, data cable, and a chintzy earphone.        DESIGN & BUILD: 6/10 Like any other sub-20K phones, G play mini made up of plastic. Talking about\xa0ergonomics of this phone, the phone feels heavy and is extremely difficult to use with one hand as the phone comes with bigger bezels. The phone weighs\xa0162 gms, which is abnormal for a 5-inch phone. Last year’s Huawei Honor 3c has a 5-inch display and weighs 140gms. Comparing it with other 5-inch devices, it feels bulky and heavy.       Smartphone with 5-inch Display  Weight  Height  Width  Thickness    Huawei Gplay Mini  163 gms  144mm  71.9mm  8.8mm    Huawei Honor 3c  140 gms  139mm  71.4mm  \xa0 \xa0 9.2mm    Samsung Galaxy E5  125 gms  141mm  70.2mm  \xa0 \xa0 7.2mm      \xa0DISPLAY: 7/10  The Huawei G play Mini features a 5-inch (1280 x 720) pixel display with 294ppi (320dpi). High-definition displays are common these days in a mid-range segment, but what really matters is the quality of the screen, brightness, color reproduction and touch sensitivity.  As far as Huawei G play mini is concerned, the quality of the screen is really good with decent viewing angles thanks to the IPS technology. The display panel manages to produce vibrant and accurate colors, but there are two minor glitches that I saw in the display. First of all, the screen is not bright enough. Under normal usage, it’s okay but when you keep Honor 3c and Gplay mini side by side, Huawei Honor 3c screen is brighter and better compared to Gplay mini.   Another thing that might annoy you is how fingerprint magnet the screen is; it easily attracts smudge marks and you will find yourself cleaning the display quite often. Moreover, the display lacks Corning  Gorilla Glass protection  and is therefore prone to scratches.  SOFTWARE UI: 7/10  The Huawei G play mini is running the Huawei Emotion 3.0 UI on top of Android 4.4.2 KitKat. The Emotion UI is\xa0not stock, but the 3.0 version is much better than any of its previous version. However, there are still improvements to be done from Huawei in its Software UI.    PERFORMANCE: 8/10  The Huawei G play mini is equipped with Huawei’s in-house Kirin 620 chipset with an Octa core 1.2Ghz Cortex A53 64 bit processor supplemented by 2GB of DDR3 RAM.  The Kirin 620 Chipset is somewhat similar to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 615 chipset seen on Micromax Yureka Yu, HTC desire 820 and Xiaomi Mi4i. Under normal usage like browsing, chatting,etc., the phone is deprived\xa0of any lags. The phone runs smoothly while multi-tasking or switching between apps.   I installed some heavy games like FIFA15, MC5, etc and it runs smoothly without any lags. It tends to heat after continuous usage, but that won’t bother you too much. Even flagship phones like Samsung Galaxy S6 and HTC one M9 heats up while playing that kind of graphics demanding games.  Overall, the performance of the G play mini is its biggest asset. If you want a phone with the best performance in this price range, G play mini would be a worthy choice.   MEMORY: 7/10  The Huawei G play mini comes with 8GB inbuilt storage out of which only 3.5GB is available to users. This big chunk of memory is taken by the Operating System. However, you can expand the memory via a microSD card slot up to 32GB. You can move most of the apps to SD card, but some apps can only be installed to the internal storage.  CAMERA  The Huawei G play mini is capable of capturing some nice shots as it’s been equipped with a 13MP rear facing camera – and decent feature for such a low-cost device. Up front, a 5MP camera can capture excellent selfies.   The \xa0 13 MP back camera can capture good photos during\xa0daylight. Macro shots are amazing with lots of details, vividness, and accurate color reproduction. Low or artificial light shot\xa0is not impressive but doesn’t\xa0disappoint\xa0at all. Check out the photos sample here:  LINK \xa0  BATTERY: 7/10  The non-removable 2550 mAh battery on the Huawei G play mini is more than enough for one day of moderate usage. You can watch Youtube Videos continuously for 4 hrs. Upon continuous browsing and chatting, it should give you 5 hrs of backup.   CONNECTIVITY: 8/10  The phone supports Dual GSM 3G SIM (HSPA). Other connectivity\xa0includes WiFi 802.11b/g/n, WiFi Direct support, WiFi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.0, and GPS/GLONASS. However, the phone doesn’t support USB OTG\xa0and neither has 4G LTE bands.   VERDICT:  Overall, the Huawei G play mini is among the good mid-range smartphones available in Nepal. At Rs. 19,999 it’s bit costly compared to the Honor 4c even though the smartphone has almost the same specs. If you are looking for a Dual SIM smartphone with a really good performance around Rs. 20,000, the G play mini is a good choice. To summarize, here are the pros and cons of the smartphone.      PROS  CONS    -Value for Money  -Bulky and Heavy    -Decent Performance  -Still Runs Kitkat 4.4.2    -Good Camera  -Screen isn’t the brightest      Thanks for the tip  Pujan  Find the  Latest Huawei Smartphone’s\xa0Specification and also the price in Nepal.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_9968.jpg']

Not only size of the screen matters, but factors like resolution, Pixel density, AMO-LED Vs IPS-LCD technology, number of multi-touch and Gorilla Glass protection also plays a massive role.                  Gorilla Glass simply refers to the registered trademark name of a specialized glass\xa0developed and manufactured by Corning. It’s light weight, slimness, and strength make it one of the widely used glasses in smartphones.  Corning had introduced “muscle glass” with several experiments conducted from 1950s. The glass marketed as “Chemor” was used in automotive, aviation and pharmaceutical industries. Steve Jobs wanted a strong glass to be used in his phone instead of plastic as plastic glasses were prone to cracks. At that time, Corning was not set up for mass production but Jobs placed an order for a ton of Gorilla Glass motivating Corning to take the risk. For this purpose, those experiments were rejuvenated which gave birth the use of gorilla glass in I phone which was released in 2007.         Gorilla Glass 2 is 20 percent thinner than the original Gorilla Glass. Gorilla Glass 3 is up to three times more scratch-resistant than the previous version, with enhanced ability to resist deep scratches. It’s design had first use of atomic-scale modeling. After Gorilla Glass 3, Corning indicated that areas for future improvements would be reducing reflectivity and susceptibility to fingerprint smudges, and changing the surface treatments and the way it is finished.   Gorilla glass 4 is of same thickness and scratch resistance properties than its prior version. But this time Corning focused on accident related impact damages that shatter the phone screen which is a real issue to be dealt by the phone user instead of the minor scratches.It is twice as stronger than its counter competitors. It says to survive 80% of 3.3 feet flat drop which is the emulation of real life surfaces keeping the phone intact. Today Corning states that over three billion mobile devices used Gorilla Glass.

Batteries have a finite life-cycle and you can’t extend their life indefinitely. Upon careless usage, smartphone battery gets bloated (swollen). Many users often experience this after a year or so.  A swollen battery \xa0is of no use, as it discharges way quicker than a normal battery and moreover can cause damage to other components of the smartphone. So, here are some tips to avoid smartphone batteries from getting bloated:  1. Don’t overheat your smartphone continuously Overheating your smartphone can cause damage to your lithium ion battery. Overheating usually occurs when you play heavy graphics intensifying games for too long or using your smartphone continuously for 2-3 hours. To avoid overheating, don’t use your smartphone continuously. Give the phone some rest (5-10 mins) before using it again.         2. Never use your phone while charging Using a phone while it is charging means the phone is continuously being charged and discharged stopping the battery from\xa0entering a full charging cycle, damaging the battery.   The ideal charging temperature of a battery is between 20-30 degree Celsius, but when you are using the phone and charging it, the temperature of the battery rises up to 50-60 degree Celsius and will damage the battery.  3. Don’t let the battery percentage go down to Zero It’s a good practice to charge your phone when it gets to around 10%. This process lengthens your battery life.   4. Charge the battery with its own charger  Most smartphones including Android, Windows and Blackberry use the same Micro USB chargers. But it is important to check the charger specification before you charge the battery of the smartphone. Some smartphone are not compatible with 2 Ampere quick charger and can damage the battery. So, it is highly recommended that you charge your phone with the charger you received while buying.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/battery.jpg']

Ltd., the authorized distributor of Karbonn smartphones in Nepal, has officially announced a new smartphone named Titanium Mach Two for NRP. 18,153. It is available in different offline smartphone stores all across Nepal.  Karbonn Mach Two is a midrange Android-based smartphone that comes with a 5 inch HD IPS touch screen with a resolution of 1280×720 pixels resulting in a respectable pixel density of 294ppi. The screen is protected by a Gorilla Glass 3 and is scratch proof to some extent.         Under the hood, the phone is powered by an Octa core processor manufactured by Mediatek. The processor has 8 Cortex A7 cores, all running at a frequency of 1.4GHz. We should expect decent multitasking performance with these 8 cores, but since the processor is manufactured by Mediatek and is build on cortex A7 architecture, you should expect lags and occasional stuttering while playing graphically intensifying games. The phone has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of inbuilt storage. The phone memory can be further expanded thanks to a microSD card slot.  For photography, it comes with an 8MP camera with LED flash and BSI II Sensor. The camera is mediocre, lacking in both details and color reproduction. The secondary camera, however, can capture really good photos since it is equipped with an 8MP sensor.  The Karbonn Titanium Mach 2 still runs an outdated Android version in KitKat 4.4. Karbonn is particularly not famous for providing the end users with latest updates, so this phone might not get Lollipop 5.0. The phone packs a 1900mAh battery.  The best thing about the Mach 2 is it’s design. It is by far the best looking smartphone in this price range and is perhaps the best looking phone Karbonn has ever managed. It’s light and super thin and sturdier in the hands.  [fbcomments]']",[]

['Colors K20 Droid Review: Budget Android Phone with Big Battery'],"['Colors', 'Reviews']",['By Yankee Maharjan -  '],"['May 14, 2015']",2015-05-14 12:29:59+00:00,"['Colors Pearl Black K20 Droid will provide 15 days of Standby time.                   Colors has recently launched a new handset under the Pearl black flagship. This all new handset is known for its extremely long lasting battery backup. We are talking about all new Colors K20 Droid which is a budget smartphone and is launched at the price of just Rs. 17,494. The USP of this handset is its large battery backup and one can even use it as a power bank to charge other phones. Apart from that, it sports a 5-inch high-definition screen, Octa-core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of inbuilt storage, 8MP rear camera and 2MP front camera. But the question is does it offer a good user experience in day to day use? We try to find out in our review…  Looks and Built quality:  The phone, like any other budget phones, is completely made out of hard plastic. The back might be glossy but it doesn’t attracts much fingerprints, well not in this white variant.\xa0The phone is by no means\xa0slippery, and thus you get a very firm hold of this phone. The back panel is removable giving you access to memory card slots and 2 SIMs. Unfortunately, the battery is not accessible.  There’s nothing much going on in the design aspect.\xa0\xa0It feels very solid on hand, but since the phone boasts a huge battery it might feel heavy and thicker than other handsets. The\xa0external navigation buttons\xa0are not backlit, so you might find it difficult to use. Volume Buttons and the power key are soft and responsive unlike other phones with hard buttons. The gold and white chrome finish gives the phone a premium look. Overall, the phone doesn’t look ugly.        Display:  It houses a 5 inch HD IPS display with a resolution of 1280*720 which means it’s a 720p display with a pixel density 294 ppi. The color that the panel produces are really sharp and bright. It’s a pretty decent display but if you look close enough you’re going to see the pixels. The outdoor visibility is fairly okay.  The phone supports 1080p video playback and the Videos look quite good and detailed.\xa0 The speaker on the back is pretty loud and clear to some extent, but there are some distortions when you play it at higher volume\xa0and it can be solved if you manage the inbuilt equalizer. The screen lacks Gorilla Glass protection and is prone to scratches. So, it is highly recommended that you insert a screen guard.  Software  Colors K20 Droid runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat and the user interface is very close to the stock version of the OS. Colors has not given a specific timeframe for the rollout of Lollipop and looking at the history from Colors, we might not get Lollipop update in this phone.  The UI is stock, albeit with all the funky icons. The notification bar is similar to stock version of Kitkat. \xa0The phone has a minor bug while trying to drag the quick notification toggle with 2 fingers. Hopefully, an update will fix this issue in the future.  Performance:  Colors K20 Droid is powered by a 1.4 GHz MediaTek MT6592 Octa-core processor and 1GB RAM. We were satisfied with the performance of the phone while navigating across the menu, launching apps, browsing the web and clicking photos. The phone comes with 8GB internal storage out of which 6.12GB is available to the user. Storing multimedia content is not an issue since the phone supports microSD cards up to 32GB capacity.  The processor that is being used in this phone is a MediaTek MT6592 which has 8 cortex A7 cores, so the phone has decent multi-tasking experience thanks to its 8 cores. However, the Cortex A7 low-performing cores and Mali400MP4 GPU doesn’t perform well while playing graphics demanding games.  In synthetic benchmarks, the phone scored 11010 in Quadrant and 47.9 in Nenamark 2, 1929 (multi-core)/232 (single-core) in Geekbench 3, and 1321 in Vellamo tests.  Camera:  Colors K20 Droid\xa0sports a 8MP rear camera with LED flash and a 2MP front-facing camera. The camera is not one of the strong point of the phone. The camera is capable of taking decent phones in day light\xa0with good color reproduction. However, in low light, the picture quality is below-par.  Front camera does a decent job while taking occasional selfies and video calling, but it is by no means a selfie smartphone. The front camera lacks wide angle lens and better sensor and thus can only caputre mediocre photos. Check out the photo samples  here .  Battery:  This phone is a powerhouse when it comes to the battery. It will last a complete two days with moderate usage. And if you’re a heavy user it will last 8-10 hours easily. The phone has a power saving mode under the battery options which keeps your CPU under-clocked for better battery life. If this is your primary device, you can use it as a power bank too.  Verdict  Overall, Colors K20 Droid is a good option in a sub -20K price segment. If you want to buy a smartphone with good battery life, then it’s an excellent choice. But, if you play high-end games and want a better camera phone, Colors K20 Droid might disappoint you.   If you’re looking for alternatives, the Gionee Marathon M3 is another smartphone that offers similar hardware and an even bigger battery. However, it is priced higher, at Rs 20,000.       PROS  CONS    -Excellent battery life  Mediocre Camera    -Good Screen Quality  -Heating issues    -Good performance  Funky UI']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Colors-k-20-Smartphone.jpg']

If you are looking for a mid-range\xa0smartphone that won’t cost you ample amount of money, then Galaxy E5 would be a commendable nominee. The phone comes with a superb screen, excellent build quality, decent performance and amazing battery life. It is also worth noting the availability of the service across the country. So without further ado, here are our\xa05 reasons to buy the Samsung Galaxy E5   Superb screen : The best thing about this phone is its screen. The 5 inch SUPER AMOLED screen is bright, vivid and reasonably sharp with a high definition resolution resulting in a pixel density of 294 pixels per inch (PPI). \xa0For a smartphone with a 5in screen, the Galaxy E5 is surprisingly small and manageable, making it quite easy to use with one hand. There is also a gorilla Glass protection on the front. The touch response is also very good as it supports 10\xa0multi touch\xa0points.  Excellent\xa0Battery life : The battery life of this smartphone is one of the best in the price segment. The battery capacity is not much bigger at 2,400mAh, but since the phone is not equipped with a bigger resolution screen and a power hungry processor, you can expect to get much more than a day’s solid use out of it.   Decent Performance : With trimmed down Touchwiz UI, the Qualcomm’s 64 bit Snapdragon 410 SoC and 1.5GB of RAM offer good performance. It’s pretty smooth at opening apps and you won’t notice any obvious slowdown or stuttering, even with a handful of apps running at once.  Remarkable\xa0Front Camera : The 5-megapixel front camera with ‘Wide Selfie’ function is the highlight of this phone. It can capture excellent selfies and is ideal for self-portrait and video calling.  Good cellular call quality : One of the most important feature users often overlook is the Call quality. The cellular call quality of Galaxy E5 is really good\xa0and performs as good as other flagship smartphones from Samsung. The inbuilt mic can record quality sound too.    Galaxy combines a sleek new design with decent specifications to make a persuasive mid-range smartphone that looks much better than its competitors.        Samsung Galaxy E5 Specification:   5 inch  Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with 720p resolution  2GHz Quad-core  snapdragon 410 chipset with Adreno 306 GPU with 1.5GB of RAM  16GB internal  storage and supports microSD card upto  64GB  8MP  autofocus primary camera with LED flash  5MP  front-facing camera  2G, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Dual SIM, USB tethering and WiFi Hotspot  2400 mAh  Non-removable battery']",[]

Within a short period we noticed changes in the technology of gadgets we used. from old film camera to DSLR, an old CRT Television to a smart LED TV.  1. Old CRT Televison:  The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is also known as the  Braun tube . The CRT televison we first noticed was the tuner tevelsion that would we were able to tune like a radio to find out TV channels. The first TV channel in nepal was Nepal TV with slogan\xa0 Communication for Development (विकासको लागी संचार) in 1985.\xa0From 1975 to 2001, the number of televisions per 1,000 people increased from 0 to 8, which has surely increased now after 13 years time.         2. Tunner Radio  It can be hard to say\xa0when exactly people first started listening to the radio in Nepal. But evidence suggests that people used to listen to radio before the first radio station was even established in Nepal. The first radio station was established in 1950 which was ‘Radio Nepal’.  The radio became popular in elite circles in Nepal too. However, without the ruler’s assent, nobody was allowed to have a radio set.\xa0In July 1946, Prime Minister Padma Shamser Rana declared that people could have personal radios.\xa0Until 1995 Radio Nepal was the only radio station to broadcast in Nepal.   3. Camera  Here we \xa0are talking about the camera that used 35 mm Film. An image shot is 36×24\xa0mm in the most common “full-frame” format. A roll of film which had around 30 to 35 frames to shoot according to the which company film you buy\xa0were all a one time shot. The negatives were then presented to the a studio for the real image to come out.  [metaslider id=7618] 4. Hand Game Console  The increasing trend of\xa0\xa0handheld consoles such as the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita has diminished the use of old fashioned hand held consoles which we usally call Brick Game. I remember being the best in my circle of friends. The Brick game console developed to be a 99 in 1 or even 999 in 1 game console. Even though we can play the brick game in our smartphones its not that fun to play as it used to be before.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img_66061-scaled.jpg']

We had some time to play with this phone and here are our early\xa0impressions:  Design         There is nothing much going on in terms of design. The phone is made up of plastic, but feels more premium thanks to it’s textile pattern on the back. Talking about\xa0ergonomics of this phone, the phone is on a heavier side and it’s difficult to use with one hand as the phone comes with bigger bezels.  Display   The Huawei Gplay mini comes with a 5 inch 720P screen.\xa0The IPS display, even though it’s a 720p resolution,\xa0has\xa0decent\xa0viewing angles and decent colour reproduction. However, the screen is not bright enough and lacks gorilla glass protection.  Interface  The Huawei Gplay mini is running the Huawei Emotion 3.0 UI on top of Android 4.4.2 KitKat. The Emotion UI is\xa0not stock, but the 3.0 version is much better than any of its previous version. However, there are still improvements to be done from Huawei in its Software UI.  Processor and Memory  The Huawei Gplay mini is equipped with Huawei’s in-house Kirin 620 chipset with an Octa core 1.2Ghz Cortex A53 64 bit processor supplemented by 2GB of DDR3 RAM and 8GB in-built storage. The phone storage can be further expanded via a microSD card slot up to 32GB.   The Kirin 620 Chipset is somewhat similar to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 615 chipset seen on Micromax Yureka Yu, HTC desire 820 and Vivo X5 max. We can expect similar performance in Gplay mini with the Kirin 620. The phone during my hands on time\xa0was deprived\xa0of any lags even while multi-tasking or switching between apps. We will know more about the phone’s performance once we review the phone.  Camera   The Huawei Gplay mini is capable of capturing some nice shots as it’s been equipped with a 13MP rear facing camera – and decent feature for such a low-cost device. Up front, a 5MP camera can capture excellent selfies.  The phone has\xa02550 mAh battery, slightly bigger than most other mid-range Huawei\xa0smartphones.Although the back is removable, but you cannot remove the battery.\xa0It has two micro\xa0SIM card slots (Both 3G) and a microSD card slot.

Custom UI’s like Samsung Touchwiz, HTC Sense, Huawei Emotion UI or Xiaomi MIUI usually consumes a lot of RAM than the Stock UI. For eg. Samsung Touch wiz UI on my Galaxy S4 consumes around 1GB of RAM, and that effects the overall phone’s performance. Moreover, there are lots of Samsung’s in-house apps that cannot be uninstalled. By Rooting your phone, you can uninstall these Bloatware apps and free up your RAM, which of course isn’t possible without Rooting.        2. Overclocking  When you root your Android, you gain some control over the hardware components, making overclocking and under Volting possible. It’s not uncommon to overclock a 1GHz Android CPU up to 1.6GHz, of course with a greater tendency toward instability. Several root-only apps available in the Android Market handle both overclocking and undervolting, such as SetCPU and Voltage Control.  3.\xa0Custom ROM’s  There are hundreds of custom ROM’s out there on market that changes the entire look and feel of your phone. I recently installed a custom ROM called “ Cataclysm ” on Nexus 5, which looks insanely good. Another custom ROM that you can try is \xa0Cyanogenmod. \xa0 It is the most popular ROM that exists for the Android OS.\xa0It has tons of\xa0customization options, and is extremely stable.  4. Moving Apps to SD card\xa0  When you install an app on your phone, it is stored on the phone’s memory. “Rooting” allows you to move installed applications to your SD card, thus freeing up system memory for additional files or apps. This feature can be very useful for smartphones that are low on internal storage.  5. Apps for Rooted Phones Only:  There are majority of useful apps that are exclusive to Rooted phones only. Here are the top 30 Rooted Apps you should know of:  LINK  Disadvantages of Rooting:  1. Rooting immediately voids your phone’s warranty 2. Rooting involves the risk of “bricking” your phone 3. Rooting and installing a unstable ROM can effect the performance of the phone.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/original-Copy.jpg']

The official unveiling will take place on 16th of April, 2015 and only 32GB version will be sold. The Samsung Galaxy S6 price in Nepal will be approx. Rs.77,900, and the Edge variant will cost Rs.94,900. But the\xa0variant 128GB Galaxy S6 price has not been revealed yet.  The Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are the flagship device that comes with Android 5.0.2 Lollipop operating system out of the box. To be cut and clear it is the rival to the apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus running on iOS 8.\xa0The South Korean manufacturer has manage use of more premium materials (glass and metal) in Galaxy S6 compared to  Galaxy S5  which is plastic built.         Display  The new\xa0Samsung\xa0Galaxy S6 models\xa0feature a\xa0 5.1-inch 2K AMOLED\xa0display  (2560 x 1440 pixels) . The pixel density goes up to 572ppi, much more higher than the\xa0326ppi as\xa0in the iPhone 6.\xa0The device display also features a coating of Corning’s  Gorilla Glass 4   ensuring your device remains scratch-less.  Processor  Samsung, this time has parted ways with Qualcomm’s processor tech for its latest flagship and is instead using it’s own Exynos silicon. The Samsung Galaxy S6 has been designed with\xa0Exynos 7 Octa-core processor which contain two quad-core processor clocked at 2.1 GHz and 1.5GHz respectively, coupled with 3GB RAM.\xa0Samsung\xa0has also planed some Qualcomm Snapdragon variants of the Galaxy S6.  RAM  The Samsung Galaxy S6 has the super-fast LPDDR4 3GB RAM. 3GB can run the device without too many lags and along with the new Exynos chip it could deal better with the TouchWiz.  Camera  The Galaxy S6 features a 16-megapixel rear camera with an aperture of ƒ/1.9. The secondary camera’s resolution is 5-megapixel that comes with an aperture of ƒ/1.9, which makes it an ideal device to take low-light selfies.\xa0The additional imaging options of the handset include optical image stabilization, auto HDR, 4K video capture, dual video capture and IR white balance detection.  No Removable\xa0battery  A change that most users may not like can be Samsung’s\xa0decision to fit in a non-removable battery.The Samsung Galaxy S6 removed the replaceable battery found in the Galaxy S5 and almost all Samsung smartphones, but now allows you to charge the smartphone wirelessly. It supports WPC and PMA wireless charging using Samsung’s own charging pad.  On using a traditional microUSB cable, According to Samsung ,50 percent battery can be charged in a half hour. It comes with a 2,550mAh battery.  No Expandable storage  Another change that most users may not like is the exclusion of additional storage.The company’s minimum storage capacity model has been\xa0upgraded from 16GB to 32GB. Samsung has also pulled out support for microSD card slot\xa0which had been a feature that set Samsung phones\xa0apart from the iPhone. Personally I don’t think this is costumer friendly approach.  Samsung\xa0S6 Edge and Samsung Galaxy S6 \xa0Price in Nepal  Samsung has announced that they will be dropping the price of the Galaxy S6/S6 Edge all over the world due to poor sales expectations.

['Aluminum Battery that charges your smartphone in 1 min'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['April 10, 2015']",2015-04-10 13:18:12+00:00,"['Stanford University scientists have developed the first high-performance aluminum battery that’s fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive. They say it can charge a smartphone in 1 mins and is a safer substitute to many commercial batteries in use today.  “We have developed a rechargeable aluminum battery that may replace existing storage devices, such as alkaline batteries, which are bad for the environment, and lithium-ion batteries, which occasionally burst into flames,”\xa0Stanford professor of chemistry Hongjie\xa0Dai told\xa0 CNBC . “Our new battery won’t catch fire, even if you drill through it.”  “Our new battery will not catch fire, even if you drill through it.”  HOW IT WORKS  This rechargeable aluminium battery with high-rate capability uses an  Aluminium   metal  as a negative charged anode and a three-dimensional  Graphitic-foam  as a positive charged \xa0 cathode. The battery operates through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminium at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite, using a non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near  2\xa0volts , a specific capacity of about 70\xa0mA\xa0h\xa0g –1  and a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98 per cent. The cathode was found to enable fast anion diffusion and intercalation, affording  charging times of around one minute  with a current density of ~4,000\xa0mA\xa0g –1  (equivalent to ~3,000\xa0W\xa0kg –1 ), and to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without capacity decay.  In a video demonstration (below), scientists were able to show how their prototype aluminum batteries are used to charge a smartphone “ within a minute. “   WHY DIDN’T MANUFACTURER\xa0USE ALUMINIUM BATTERIES FROM THE BEGINNING?  Aluminum has long been a striking material for batteries, mainly because of its low cost, low flammability and high-charge storage capacity. For decades, researchers have tried unsuccessfully to develop a commercially viable aluminum-ion battery\xa0because\xa0aluminum batteries lasted just 100 charge cycles while the Stanford aluminium-ion battery can withstand more\xa0than 7,500 charge cycles without any loss of capacity.        But with Stanford aluminium-ion battery, there is still one barrier the researchers are facing: Scientist\xa0are unable to produce sufficient voltage after repeated cycles of charging and discharging. This means the battery does not offer as much voltage as existing solutions – coming in a about half the voltage of lithium ion packs. If the scientist can find a way to add up the extra voltage, then it’s going to make a big break through in smartphone history.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6997580445_d9aabbc2ed_o-620x372.jpeg']

['What have we lost in the shift from cigarettes to smartphones?'],[],['By GadgetByte -  '],"['April 5, 2015']",2015-04-05 01:09:09+00:00,"['When I gave up smoking four years ago, it struck me how important smoking had been to my experience of travelling: I no longer had any idea how much time to spend staring at a beautiful view or taking in an atmospheric street scene. One minute? An hour? Ten seconds? It used to be measured in cigarettes. The rapid expansion of coffee culture in the English-speaking world in the 21st century—both of the branded, Starbucks variety, and its hipster, Australasian cousin—can partly be understood as plugging this gap. A dose of caffeine takes longer to administer than one of nicotine, but both provide a staging post, either solitary or social, in a day that is otherwise short of routine.  I once asked an old friend, through a thick haze of smoke, what he liked most about a cigarette, to which he replied, “It frames a moment.” In the age of the smartphone, we have developed a more literal way of framing moments: a digital record is made, always with the possibility of being shared. The selfie is the more infamous manifestation of this, putting the taker’s narcissism on full public display. Yet this is simply a more brazen version of the banal tweet or status update about one’s whereabouts or activity.  In the aftermath of smoking, the smartphone has become our handy “moment-framing” tool of choice, even more so than the coffee cup. As with the cigarette, the smartphone feels most needed at precisely those moments when routine is most lacking, like when we’re between other places or waiting for someone to arrive. The strange need to inform one’s friends and followers that one is presently  in an airport  (tweets such as “JFK>LHR”) speaks of a latent desire for framing that might once have been sated by a cigarette. It’s not as if air travel is remotely exotic or exciting any longer, but more that it creates a sense of “between-ness” that prompts the urge for an anchor.        Flickr/VRYSXY69. Some rights reserved.  \xa0  In a superficial sense, the smartphone is quite a good cigarette replacement, and certainly a less carcinogenic one. It offers us something to do with our hands, and a way of feeling legitimately alone in public spaces like cafes. It fits into the pocket. For some people, it’s the first personal item that they reach for after a meal or after sex, just like a cigarette (the challenge with smart phones is to resist looking at them  during  these activities). Adults need objects that travel around with them, confirming their identities from place to place, not unlike children. If I can no longer smoke a ‘fag’ (as we like to say in Britain) as I gaze at the sun setting over a harbor, I can at least snap the moment on my phone, with or without a selfie stick.  But on a deeper psychological and cultural level, the difference between these two framing devices could scarcely be more profound. This touches on the malaise of anxiety that has become the dominant psychiatric disorder of our age. While smoking affirms the limits of time and space around us, smart phones do precisely the opposite. While one allows you to spend a finite chunk of time in a given space, as a break from the flux of work or travel, the other connects you to a more complex and fluid world beyond your immediate situation.  As framing devices go, the smart phone suffers from the inherent problem that it is leaky. It is constantly connecting us to other times, other places, absent people, absent places, some in the future and some in the past. The selfie may seem narcissistic, but it is captured with the possibility of being seen by others who are not present (at least, not yet). If it is an expression of anything, it is one of paranoia: paranoia that human memory is no longer adequate for experiences, that one may be seen by others, that one may  not  be seen by others.  This is a restless condition. Where the cigarette allows us to (in the immortal words of Oasis’s horrifically bombastic 1997 album) be here now, a smart phone allows us to do precisely the opposite. In this psychological sense, it is the very antithesis of a cigarette. The transition from the one object in our pocket to the other speaks of a more general shift in the character of capitalism.  The rise and fall of smoking closely mirrors the rise and fall of another notorious pollutant: industrial manufacturing. Smoking levels and industrial jobs in the United States and United Kingdom both peaked just after the Second World War, when over 80% of adult men were smokers, and close to 40% of employment was in manufacturing. These rates are now at around 18% and 10% respectively, and falling.  Besides both puffing out smoke, factories and cigarettes shared a common economic culture, based around stable, mechanical routines. This is equally true of traditional white collar, professional jobs in the pre-digital age. Smoking, to the extent that it is still tolerated today, reflects some of the values of the mid-20th century workplace. Smoking breaks happen with a certain regularity, lasting the three or four minutes it takes to finish a cigarette. The workplace ‘smoking room’ was traditionally the place where colleagues would have a brief conversation with others, regardless of hierarchy, safe in the knowledge that it could only last a few minutes and would then be largely forgotten about.  It is generally taboo to point out the psychological security provided by smoking. One exception is where mental health patients are concerned. In 2013, Britain’s health regulator, NICE, demanded that hospitals ban patients from smoking outside. Given that over 80% of diagnosed schizophrenics are smokers, this alarmed some mental health experts and charities, who argued that some patients’ lives would clearly be worse without cigarettes. Mightn’t there be other less serious cases, anxiety-sufferers for example, who would also benefit from a more forgiving view of this habit?  Smoking’s decline has gone hand in hand with the decline of predictable working and leisure routines. In place of the rhythm of work, break, work, break, which cigarettes helped to punctuate, we now live in a society that lacks interruptions. This shift was noted in a short but influential essay by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze. In “Postscript on Societies of Control,” Deleuze contrasted what he termed “control societies” of the late 20th century with the “disciplinary societies” that emerged in the 19th century. As Deleuze argued, “In the disciplinary societies one was always starting again (from school to the barracks, from the barracks to the factory), while in the societies of control one is never finished with anything.”  Contemporary society, as Deleuze noted presciently, lacks adequate boundaries between one period in time and another. It lacks ways of “framing a moment.” Hence, in our relentless celebration of the decline of smoking, we are also accelerating the demise of “disciplinary” or “industrial” routines which while inflexible and unhealthy, once provided an amount of psychological security.  For the flexible, enterprising, gym-going success stories of our always-on age, this is a win-win. For those at the higher end of the labor market, physical health and economic productivity are now a single virtue to be pursued at all times. But it turns out that many people cannot cope with this uninterrupted stream of experiences, data and movement. The condition of being “never finished with anything” is at the root of a pervasive disquiet.  It’s in this context that we can understand the rise of “mindfulness” as a tool of managers in the workplace. It has recently been suggested by British politicians that “mindfulness” should be taught to government employees, as a way of dealing with stress and anxiety, which lead to absence from work and costs to the taxpayer. Techniques for aiding concentration, such as meditation or “digital detoxing,” are now central parts of the armory of management and life coaching, even becoming compulsory in some workplaces.  While mindfulness may claim a Buddhist lineage dating back over 2,000 years, its present popularity is primarily explicable in terms of contemporary economic culture and technology. The goal of mindfulness is to dwell entirely in the moment, simply noticing one’s own thoughts, body, and environment. It is a way of punctuating the constant flow, giving the self a brief, circumscribed period when thoughts and feelings can simply be observed, without concern or judgment. It frames a moment in time. Come to think of it, it sounds very like stepping outside for a cigarette.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that “ civilization  is a hopeless race to discover remedies for the evils it produces.” Now that wellbeing gurus exhort us to monitor our rest and relaxation, to ensure that we’re taking an optimal amount of time away from work and screens, the particular evil of post-industrial capitalism is abundantly clear. In the quest for a more flexible, healthy, seamless capitalism, we’ve lost the ability to be in one place at one time, or one conversation at one time. Anxiety is the inevitable result.  But the remedies are simply inversions of the problem. In response to the paranoid condition of hyper-connectivity, we are offered a complete, silent insularity. The digital age is gobbling up the convivial middle ground between connection and disconnection – the sort of middle ground represented by the smoking room. Why must we be trained how to sit motionless, alone with our thoughts? Why not chat idly to one’s colleagues for ten minutes, or go for a walk? One reason why not is that, unless one is a smoker, these exercises do not simply just happen any longer.  It would be perverse to wish for a return to a 1940s society of smokestacks and cigarettes. But it is stupid to think that we can simply train ourselves into a state of calm, against the countervailing forces posed by business, policy, and digital technology. Against the ideals of limitless health and limitless connectivity, we need to defend the right to separate our lives into different times and places, some of activity, others of passivity, some of conversation, others of solitude. We shouldn’t need Buddhism to articulate this. And if it involves the occasional cigarette, so be it.

But, I thought about it for a while and made a conclusion that it’s not a right time to invest on a smartwatch. Here are the top 3\xa0reasons why you should not think of getting it right now:  1.  Pricing and Availability:\xa0         Apart from Samsung, you don’t see any smart watch being sold officially\xa0here in Nepal. There is no Google store or the Apple Store in Nepal, Pebbles are hard to find in the retail stores, Samsung galaxy Gear watch are just not worth it yet, and even if you get good looking smartwatch like the\xa0LG G Watch or the Moto 360, you will need to pay a lot more as it is very rare. So, it’s better to wait until the\xa0price gets\xa0right and is made available officially.  2.  Compatibility issues:\xa0  Most of the Android smartwatch need to have a smartphone that runs on Android Kitkat 4.4.2 or higher. As far as iWatch is concerned, you need an iPhone 5 or better. Then how about Gear?? Opps! you need a Samsung Smartphone first! \xa0Since there are lot of users in Nepal still using Jelly Bean or lower, smartwatch might not just for you yet.  3.  Battery Life   The maximum battery life a smartwatch can give you is around 24 hrs (except Pebbles), which means you need to charge it at the end of everyday. I checked the load shedding schedule of my group and out of seven days in a week, there is a power cut on three days (at night). So, when i come home after work at night, i won’t be able to charge my smartwatch everyday, or even if i do, by waking up late night, it ‘s too annoying to say the least.  So, i suggest you not to rush right now.\xa0The smartwatch\xa0market is just evolving, and I’m sure there will be better offerings in the future. With the competition provided by other companies, smartphone price will get cheaper as well as better.

"['What is Rooting, and What are its advantages?']","['Apps', 'Guides', 'Tech Guides']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['February 28, 2015']",2015-02-28 09:06:38+00:00,"['Android is one of the most popular mobile platforms for smartphones and tablets everywhere. Since its release, Android handsets have constantly been “ Rooted” , a process similar to the jailbreaking of \xa0iOS devices. The main idea behind rooting a device is to simply change how part of the device works to do more than one could before.  “Rooting” is the process in which the restrictions are removed and full access is allowed. Once rooted, the Android phone owner will have more control over many settings, features, and performance of their phone. Basically, “rooting” means to get to the root of the operating system and to have the ability to make comprehensive changes.\xa0This includes things like\xa0unlocking a carrier locked phones, installing a tethering application to act as a router, or disabling a Default manufacturer UI and installing a new one.  How to Root Your Android Device?  In order to gain root access, the user must “root” the device. This might be done using something like  S uperoneclick .\xa0These applications work by exploiting a vulnerability in some Android system application or component so that they may access root. Then, an application, “ Superuser ,” is installed. By having Superuser\xa0installed, whenever an app requests root access, rather than having the request denied, the user is notified that an application wants to root, and has the opportunity to decide to allow or deny that request.        You need to download different rooting zip files for different phones ( proceed with caution ). This procedure is recommended for Advanced users.  For Rookies keep Scrolling.  This Video is for Samsung Galaxy Y.   For the rookie users follow the below link:   Advantages to Root Your Android Device:    Bloatware    Also known as clayware and some other choice euphemisms, bloatware infects the vast majority of Android phones. You’ll recognize Samsung Touchwiz, HTC Sense, Huawei Emotion UI or Xiaomi MIUI\xa0\xa0as the custom UIs and feature packages that those makers throw on top of stock Android. While some of that bloatware are actually useful, most of it offer nothing that you couldn’t arrange on your own with other apps, and it can bog down performance or even block features from your device. Worse yet is that much of the time, Bloatware apps are blocked from uninstalling, unless of course, you root your phone.    Overclocking    When you root your Android, you gain some control over the hardware components, making overclocking and under Volting possible. It’s not uncommon to overclock a 1GHz Android CPU up to 1.6GHz, of course with a greater tendency toward instability. Several root-only apps available in the Android Market handle both overclocking and undervolting, such as SetCPU ($1.99) and Voltage Control (free or $3.36 for the Extreme version).    Performance    Besides mere overclocking, rooted users can gain other performance enhancements through kernel tweaks performed by some of the apps we’ve mentioned here, Custom ROMs, or through your own means, if you know what you’re doing. Such tweaks in combination with overclocking have been known to increase overall performance on a Nexus S by 250 percent.  When you install an app on your phone, it is stored in the phone’s memory. “Rooting” allows you to move installed applications to your SD card, thus freeing up system memory for additional files or apps.  Also, as we’ve previously reported on Maximum Tech, “most Android devices incorporate an EXT3 filesystem with considerable overhead to ensure safe file I/O interaction.

A\xa0 torrent file \xa0is a\xa0computer file\xa0that contains\xa0metadata\xa0about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of\xa0trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called\xa0 swarms .  [ 1 ] .  Torrent files allow you to download virtually any type of file from everyone else that is sharing it. Torrents allow files to be split into many small chunks. These chunks are then downloaded from other users who already have that chunk on their computer. Once all of the pieces are downloaded, the file is reconstructed and is ready to use on your computer.   When you are downloading torrent content you are a  “leecher” . When you are sharing content, you are a  “seeder” .  Read up on copyright law. A lot of what is shared using Torrents is done so illegally. Do not be one of these people. Only share and download material that you have the legal right to share.   Before you start you will need a  Torrent Client  which allows people to share files between peers. Some torrent clients may be µtorrent, Bit torrent, Tixati.        Installing Torrent Client  There are two different ways to use the torrent.  1. Magnetic Link:  This process is a very easy process which just needs a click in the torrent file providers link(which is generally a magnet sign). If the software is properly installed it automatically starts forward the process of downloading the relevant content. This is the easy and short way.But some times you may have to use the other process.  Click the Magnet Icon  2. Download .torrent file:  In this process you download the torrent file from the torrent file provider. Then import the torrent file either by drag and drop procedure or manually adding from the menu or you can open the torrent directly. After the torrent file is imported the download will start.  Download Torrent  There are different website for downloading torrent files. But some are banned in many countries.\xa0Many countries have blocked access to the  The Pirate Bay   website due to copyright issues. You can easily find a torrent website in search engines .  List of Countries blocking piratebay  In May 2010, The Pirate Bay’s Swedish Internet service provider lost an appeal against an order to stop providing service to the site. Although the service provider had already complied with an earlier order in August 2009 and The Pirate Bay was thereafter hosted elsewhere, in June 2010 the ISP chose also to block their customers from accessing The Pirate Bay in its new location. One of the judges in the case later commented that the court’s order didn’t require the ISP to control their customers’ access to the site, but the ISP wanted to avoid any risk.  The Pirate Bay was blocked in Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Georgia from 11 December 2013, due to complaints regarding the pirating of the World War II movie  Stalingrad .  So which countries are flying high for\xa0Torrent downloads?

But this time I was excited to Visit the CAN info tech. I was exited in the sense it was a great time for me to learn and share my knowledge from this info tech to everyone interested. I had been to different Tech exhibition in Finland which included the Slush 2014. It was a great experience for me to be a part of that program.  As per the trend and the swift increase in the standards of technology, a huge number of people have been attracted to technology field in Nepal. Even my father who used a mobile phone used it for phone calls and messages now asked me about how he can keep his data secure in his smartphone and what can he do find his mobile if he loses them and many more question regarding his smartphone.  We the team of Gadget Byte were guessing and  expecting what CAN info tech 2015 \xa0can give the entire tech lovers. Me myself because had not been to CAN for a while was expecting a lot from this event.        It was January 28 th  and the first day of CAN and I was there the event Venue (Bhrikutimandap) at 10 am Sharp. Since I was a participant in this event I had an event ID which let me in swiftly. The ticket Counter was not crowded but there were some people just around the entrance. My eyes went to the stalls which were under construction. The inauguration ceremony had an hour to start and the stalls were not still ready. This already was a letdown for me from the largest info tech event organizers (Computer Association of Nepal). The different stall equipment was lying in the road which even blocked to way for the visitors.   I was unaware when the inauguration ceremony happened because I was excited looking for what this exhibition had brought for the Nepali Tech lovers. Yural and I, we looked at the stalls which helped us make an overview about the event. Then Biswash joined us which made us the complete team and we started our work.  I had an objective in this expo. Learn and share. I wanted to take a lot of knowledge about the latest tech in Nepal. But unfortunately this Info Tech was not that event I could have thought that someone can be excited about. I found it as a business trade fair where every stall had item to sale with heavy discount and offers. To be honest, people who were in their respective stall were looking at each other’s faces when asked about 5 th  generation laptops and some were unaware about what they had in their stall. The visitors were just told he list of specification of the products and the price. And when further asked in detail, was not able to answer. Moving ahead one thing I found interesting was when I saw the New  Windows phone of Colors Mobile .  We were able to talk to the Microsoft representative for windows. The noise from the big huge speakers were really bothering people but it was really out of any ones control unless there has to be rule. The noise from the huge speakers made it really difficult for the people trying to listen to the stall representatives.  Another amazing thing I was able to find there was the  Zen Book by ASUS . These were the technology I always wanted the market to have and the tech lovers to use such devices. Another Smartphone which was being anticipated by our gadget byte team was the Sparkle V  Android one Phone .  Even though it was not there for sale but the booking was open. I was upset with Karbonn Mobile that there was no much promotion done so that people know about the budget smartphone which can make a huge market in this Country where people are craving for a good smartphone.  The   Kivi’s smart watch  was a good addition to the Tech event which showed their market competitiveness and as same as the Android One smartphone this was only available for booking. But there was a bit of promotion they had done which I felt had to be done in huge stage to show case their products in a centre stage.  A trend in Nepal is such a bad one that people don’t look what laptops or smartphones they want, they go into a shop and listen what the sales representative say. I think buyers need to put an effort to learn about what they are buying. This can help people to make a full use of the devices they own.  Finally I have some points that I want Computer Association of Nepal to listen and take action in make order to improve its status like the biggest info tech events like  Mobile World Congress   MWC  or  Consumer Electronics Show CES.   Construction of the stalls should finish before the event starts which can decrease accidental hazards and does not show the event’s Prestige.  Removal of huge speakers in the stalls and try to make a learning environment.  Prefer to make the info tech a place to learn and not a business trade fair. Providing knowledge to people aware people automatically help in increase in business.  A talk stage program which explains all the new release or new technology launched in the event. Scheduling the talk show which can make it more effective.  A stall map placed in various places so that people don’t need to search for the respective stalls. Or the stall map can be made available to every visitor in the ticket counter when people enter the event.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSCN3281.jpg']

Not a IPS screen  2.Samsung GS4  It’s been like 2 years since the announcement of the Samsung galaxy S4, but it is a still a powerful phone especially when its priced at Rs.36,000 here in Nepal. Talking about the specs, We love the  SUPER AMOLED \xa0 full HD screen of GS4. It has a Octa Core processor-1.6GHz quad-core plus 1.2GHz quad-core. TBH, we prefer the Snapdragon SoC rather than Samsung’s in-house Exynos SoC. It also has a 2GB of RAM,13MP camera and 2MP front camera. All of this is powered by 2600mAh battery. Unlike Xperia Z1, it is not water proof and houses a cheap plastic body.   Pros:  -Vivid and over saturated Screen  -Great camera  Cons  -Samsung’s\xa0UI is laggy  -Thin, plastic casing  3. Nexus 5  The LG Nexus 5 features a 1080p 5-inch display, an 8-megapixel camera with\xa0OIS, 2GB of RAM and Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor. All of that combines to make the Nexus 5 on of the top pick for smartphones. Since it is a Google phone manufactured by LG, we get timely updates, for eg. it runs  Android Lollipop  5.0.2 as of now. It is priced at Rs.38,000 for the 16GB version.   Pros  -Latest OS  -Attractive pricing  Cons  -No expandable memory  -Mediocre Battery Life (houses only 2300mAh battery)  4.

The midrange products from HTC are always over-rated but in the end of 2014, HTC announced HTC desire 820 which has some respectable specs and good design and build quality.

(cries) But no worrries…Internet cha ni! So, basically there are a lot of things being showcased in the CES at Las Vegas. But one of them really caught my eye; The Gogoro smartscooter.   WHAT IS IT?         \xa0  Its a smartscooter by the company established by HTC ex-executives. In 2011, Gogoro raised $100 million and another three years it raised another $50 million. All of this actually happened in somewhat ‘Stealth Mode’…seriously no-one even realised! Now they’ve got to utilize all this money and what better way than creating a “better future”: A cleaner Future! That is what envisioned by the founders of Gogoro.  HOW DOES IT WORK?   The Gogoro is a normal electrical scooter with something different, i.e. its charging and discharging methods. Just like the concept in behind LPG cylinders, these scooters have hot-swappable batteries which will charge at the Gogoro’s EV Station. So practically there’s no charging involved on user’s end. Everything happens by default.   All this process and the charging happens easily under a minute. After that you’re are go for another 100 approx kilometers. So the obvious problem for this thing to happen arises: Will Gogoro be able to live up to its billings? I mean…they would need to setup an EV station every 50kms or les say 70-80 kms just in case. Though this is not an impossible thing given the infrastructures they have, its a little too far-fetched! But they are hopeful and oh wish they nail it!  I mean, its so cool! Look at the video above and you’ll see that the badass black-leathered guy does burnouts and side swipe turns. Its awesome. Plus, it has a really cool remote and Sound & Light effects…  Overall, the concept is really cool and i love the design! I don’t think this is so viable in Nepal for obvious reasons. Hence, when are we seeing this in Nepal? No Idea!! (sigh) Hopefully sometime!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fearture.jpg']
