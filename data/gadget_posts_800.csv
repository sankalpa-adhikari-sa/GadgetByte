['LG L Bello Price in Nepal'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['December 23, 2014']",2014-12-23 05:59:22+00:00,"['CG digital,the authorized dealer of LG phones in Nepal, launched (a month ago) the L Bello smartphone in Nepal at a price of Rs. 22,990. The price is listed on the  CG digital website . LG publicizes it’s L Bello as  ‘an affordable yet powerful ’ alternative to the flagship LG G3 as the design of L Bello inherits most of the G3’s design.   LG L Bello Key Specs:   Display:  5.0-inch FWVGA (854x480p) IPS screen with pixel density of 196 ppi  Dimensions:  138.2 x 70.6 x 10.7mm  OS:  Android v4.4.2 KitKat  Chipset : Qualcomm Snapdragon 400  Processor:  1.3GHz quad-core CPU  RAM:  1GB  Storage capacity:  8GB with expandable storage up to 32GB via microSD card.  Camera:  8MP rear camera with auto-focus and LED flash and a Front1.0-megapixel camera  Battery:  2,540 mAh  Network: Dual SIM (2G+3G)   Features:  Touch & shoot, gesture shot camera features, Knock Code security feature    What we have to say about LG L Bello:   LG L Bello is a decent mid-range phone. It has a big 5 inch screen but the resolution is very low for a 5 inch phone costing around Rs.23000. However, the color reproduction and the viewing angles are decent.  On the performance side, the LG L Bello sports a Quad core Snapdragon 400 processor and 1GB of RAM which provide enough power for routine applications. Since the processor only has to drive 854×480 pixels of the screen, the performance of this phone is better than other phones like   MotoG2 ,  Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 , etc. which has 720P screen with the same Snapdragon 400 processor. G Bello’s 8MP camera camera does an overall good job and is better than other mid-range phones.        The battery life of LG L Bello is one of the best seen on a mid-range phone (Except  Gionee’s Marathon M3  which has a huge 5000mAh battery).  The USP of this device is the design. It has a plastic back but it feels much robust and solid. Like LG G2 and G3, it has the side buttons (volume buttons & lock key) on the back of the smartphone.   LG L Bello is a good effort from LG but failed to dominate the mid-range market because of its screen quality. Had the screen been a 720P, it would have been an ideal choice. We would rather suggest you to buy MotoG2/ Grand 2- both phone with 720P screen & priced around 26K.  If you don’t care about the screen size but want a solid design, go with the LG L Bello.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Untitled.png']

There were times when people present were “Oh Stop It, You are kidding, right!?” to “Oh stop giving away so many good phones!” It was a good scene altogether.  Call Mobility’s promise  On the endnote of the show which was at around 10, Pulkit Bhimsaria, the Managing Director of Call Mobility promise their retailers that they will become the most beneficial brand by the end of 2015! The promise didn’t sound overwhelming rather it was a confident speech by the man which left us thinking that Huawei must be into something BIG!!! Even in the earlier presentations, the Chinese Representatives and Country Manager of Huawei Nepal, promised to be Brand focused and Product-optimized brand by the end of 2015. That means nothing but Huawei’s aggressive plan to capture the Nepalese Smartphone market share, which means aggressive marketing and most importantly, new awesome products!

That means a lot to see these brands stepping up and recognizing Nepalese market as a prospect as well.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DSCN3042.jpg']

Honor 6 plus as a beautiful design with metal frame and is 7.5mm thin weighing 165 grams.        Huawei Honor 6 Plus: How The Dual Cameras   Honor 6 plus features unique  symmetrical dual Camera technology . There are two 8MP lenses on the rear side that produces photos with a resolution of up to 13MP. Honor 6 Plus features an Octa-Core Kirin 925 processor with a separate SLR grade ISP: these features combine to produce professional quality photos and eliminate the need of larger sensors on lightweight phones. When taking a photo, both lenses work simultaneously to achieve a rapid focus of the object. This is based on the  stereo triangulation principle , which works just like the human eye. The two lenses can obtain the absolute depth of the focused object in real time. The camera uses a closed-loop motor to achieve a rapid focus in just 0.1 seconds.  The Honor 6 plus’s dual camera design features a  unique 3IE algorithm  system and depth of field ranging from 70mm to infinity. You can adjust settings to achieve a range of depths, from F0.95 to F16. In the night mode, both the lenses capture light. The brand new  v ision  camera technology  allows both the lenses to perform iterative exposures. The unique  multi-frame noise reduction and image synthesis algorithm  greatly reduce image noise and produce more defined details. When capturing a photo, the enhanced HDR mode in the 3IE algorithm system uses dual exposure to capture both the lighter and darker areas of the photo. The data is then processed rapidly to produce an HDR photo that not only offers a higher dynamic range but also eliminates the dark areas often seen on ordinary smartphone photos.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/huawei-logo-100263197-large.jpg']

Ncell plans to launch iPhone 5S in Nepal at a price starting at  NRs. 67,199  for the 16 GB variant. Booking starts from Rs. 8,000 and each iPhone 5S comes with 300MB data every month for 6 months by Ncell. Other details are as below:   \xa0  WORTH OR NOT?  Well, it depends on various things, like Price. On the price point this seems a sweet deal since the Grey market has these phones at a higher price point. For an instance iPhone 6 Plus in Nepal is available at Rs. 1,05,000/- Comparing it with the Ncell iPhone plan, the deal looks good even without considering 1GB/month package. Other considerable point is the after-sales. Ncell has provided no clue as to how will they service their iPhone customers on repairing side. Maybe they’ll handle the repairs from their own service centers which seems quite farfetched. If Ncell has no plans for after-sales support this deal might be a bummer to some.  All in all its an Okay deal and iPhone lovers can infact benefit from this deal. I guess that’s that for now. Let us know if you opt for Ncell iPhone plan in the comments below.

['Top Emerging Nepali Apps Roundup'],['Apps'],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['December 11, 2014']",2014-12-11 05:28:48+00:00,"['Apps have been a way around us since some time now. And in this time they have proved to be playing an integral role in our lives by handling us the power of everything in our hands. Though Nepali apps seemed to play catch-up since some time, we can proudly say that Nepalese Apps are indeed destined toward a brighter horizon. Here, I take a look at some of the emerging Nepali apps I came across and give a brief introduction about them. And yes! Nepal Loadshedding app is the best one of all!!!  So, here we go!  Yellow Nepal:  Yellow Nepal is an app that most of us are familiar by right now. This app helps you find nearby restaurants or even search them as per your mood or your favorite food. The App and Yellow founder, Anish Shrestha said that there is a lot to come in this app and is in at the constant process of development. Well, we hope and pray it is. The User Interface is quite cool and yes, the app works offline as well. There’s a map feature, you can find info about the restaurants right from the app and events and deals. Though this app has a lot to improve, we think it’s a great addition and has a very big potential to grow further.         Play Store (Android)  \xa0  AutoLife Nepal:  Now, there’s a chance that you’ve not heard of this before but this app has a lot to offer when it comes to giving you infos about Autos. Yes, AutoLife is all this app is about and I have to say this app packs a punch. It has all, yes all, the features you’d expect from an app like this! From finding service centers to Accessory parts to Petrol Pumps to ATMs this app promises a lot where I couldn’t but ask myself, Will this app live up to its own promises? There are so many things (yes even a blog!) in this app but this doesn’t hinder the user-experience. And the best part, you could sell or buy used vehicles without an insider commission! YES! Well, that’s a huge promise to make and its only time to find out whether the app lives up to its name or not! If it does, there’s no stopping this app and the best way to find starts with downloading this app from the links below.   \xa0  Play Store (Android)  |  App Store (iOS)  \xa0  SCT Moco:  SCT (SmartChoice Technologies) are one of the leaders in electronic card payment system here in Nepal. And with the introduction of the Moco, well, this thing has huge potentials!  The Moco stands for Mobile Commerce and focuses primarily on on-the-go payment services. But it gets better, it has a better and efficient system for managing your payments. Unlike e-Sewa or other payment networks, SCT Moco is an all-in-one payment gateway. If you’ve ever heard of Coin, well this is the Nepali version of that. You can manage your SCT cards all at same place and use them to pay your Utility bills or Recharge Cards or even use it to shop on other sites. This is what makes it better. And because this app works in unison with the SCT, its like having a payment gateway, altogether! And all you need is an internet connection! (Of course)   \xa0  Play Store (Android)  |  App Store (iOS)  \xa0  Blood Donation  Well, this is an awesome app for emergencies. I put this app in the list of top apps because of the service and user-orientation of the app. This app serves emergencies well and you can do stuffs like finding a donor, finding blood, or even donating one, for the cause! It’s a bold step forward and a big move in helping the people in need and it goes on amplifying the needs and possibilities to what an app can serve us to! Hats down to the developers for that.   \xa0  Play Store (Android)  \xa0  nLocate  nLocate promised to be one-stop app for all the location based search services but couldn’t live up to the hype! But they’re starting again fresh and revamped! They have started a service-based search rather than an institution-based which, frankly, was the most important thing that this app lacked! It also has a revamped user interface and promises to live up and fulfill your search demands now on! (No revamped UI available as of now)  \xa0  Play Store (Android)  |  App Store (iOS)  Have you downloaded any of these apps?  Let us know how you think of these apps in the comments below!

It could take hours to transfer movies and sucked a lot of energy from the battery. But now, there is a technology called “ Wi-Fi Direct ” that helps us to transfer any kind of files between 2 devices using your Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi Direct is arguably present in almost all the smartphones and laptops right now. It is way faster than Bluetooth and consumes very little energy from your battery.  Wi-Fi Direct also doesn’t require wireless access points like Router to connect two devices. So if you are outside your home and you need to share a file, Wi-Fi Direct would be your ideal choice. Wi-Fi Direct devices also use WPA2 encryption, which is the most secure way of encrypting Wi-Fi.          Wi-Fi Direct is supposedly invented to be a standard that allows multiple types of devices supporting the Wi-Fi Direct standard to communicate with each other, this hasn’t really happened just yet. For example, there is no easy way to connect an Android smartphone to a Windows laptop. However, you can easily transfer files between two Android Devices or between two Windows laptop.  For sharing any file using Wi-Fi Direct, go to file manager->long press on that file and click share. Click on Wi-Fi Direct- and select the desired device.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mj1x5x.jpg.png']

Nokia announced the Nokia N1, which is the\xa0\xa0first Nokia-branded Android tablet. The Nokia N1 offers the innovative, predictive Nokia Z Launcher interface, and a carefully crafted industrial design by Nokia with a focus on simplicity.  Comparing Nokia N1\xa0with iPad Mini  Nokia’s N1 is almost an identical \xa0piece to the rear of the iPad mini. The placement of the camera, buttons, and headphone jack a bit in different position that of the iPad mini. Looking at\xa0the bottom of the device \xa0it has the same speaker grills as of the ipad mini and what looks like a Lightning port is actually one of the first implementations of the reversible Type-C USB connector.Nokia’s N1 display is fully laminated, unlike the iPad mini 3, and the N1 is just 6.9mm thick and 318 grams in weight, both thinner and lighter than Apple’s offering.        The only things completely different than the iPad mini look are a home button, chamfered edges, and an Apple logo. There’s even “Natural Aluminum” and “Lava Grey” color schemes, and a cover that looks very much\xa0similar to Apple’s Smart Case. Unlike the majority of Android tablets on the market, the tablet will run a stock version of the latest Android Lollipop software. ( If you want to know if your smartphones will get Android Lollipop update : Click the Link )  Nokia N1 Tablet  The Nokia N1 also takes advantage of Lollipop’s 64-bit support, which is packed in as a\xa02.4GHz quad-core Intel Atom Z3580 processor paired with a 2GB RAM. The tablet included with 32GB storage with no room to expand via microSD.  Taking tips from the iPad Mini, the Nokia N1 packs a 7.9in 2,560×1,536 IPS LCD display which sports a protective layer of Gorilla Glass and Nokia’s zero air gap technology. The Nokia N1 has\xa0a large 5300mAh battery which can made a guess that the battery life will also be a strong feature of this tablet.  Nokia N1 Battery  Nokia’s new tablet will support the older and slower USB 2.0 standard rather than the latest USB 3.1.  Reversible USB connector  Nokia has its\xa0“predictive Nokia Z Launcher” as a default Launcher. Previously, the company had released the limited pre-beta version of the Z Launcher app via the Z Launcher website in June. But now\xa0Nokia Z Launcher has been out for Android 4.1 and Higher Released which has been on  Google Play.(click here to download Nokia Z\xa0launcher).    The Nokia N1 will go on sale in China in or around February 2015, priced at around $250 (before taxes). It will then roll out to some countries in Europe and Russia. No word on whether it’s coming to the US — but given now the Nokia brand is much more recognizable/valuable on that side of the Atlantic, I wouldn’t be a surprise if we also\xa0have to wait a long time.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/N1.jpg']

['Will we have LTE in Nepal any soon?'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['December 6, 2014']",2014-12-06 05:38:18+00:00,"['LTE (Long Term Evolution) is a common phrase these days when it comes to band support from phone manufacturers. As much as you’d like to know, LTE, in simpler words, is a wireless communication standard for mobile devices which is of course faster than the 3G network or UMTS as we know it. LTE in Nepal is not an impossibility, it’s just a matter of time. Also, if you are well aware, you might as well know that NTC has already launched Wi-MAX which is a LTE competitive network for data transfer. So, we have 4G-Wi-MAX as of now but not the 4G network for our SIM cards. Will we have one? Any sooner? Let’s dig deep!  THE NECESSITY:  LTE in Nepal, might not be a necessity as of now but we’ll soon be left scratching our heads when top-tier manufacturers start having LTE in every phones. Even as of now, high-end phones are all packed with LTE. So basically, its like the feature is there but you wont be able to use it simply because our carriers don’t support LTE!  Having an LTE means having wireless speeds upto  300 Mbps  (download) and upto  75 Mbps  (upload). I know that’s too much but “too-much” is what makes LTE a choice abroad. With a perfect combo of modern-era internet usage and portability, LTE is a thing to opt now, if not any sooner!        THE EXAMPLES:  LTE was first brought up by NTT Docomo from Japan in 2004 but its commercialization began in 2005. The first public LTE Service was by Telia Sonera in Oslo (yep! that’s the company behind Ncell!). As per the stats from  Global mobile Suppliers’ Association (GSA)  331 LTE Networks have been commercially launched in 112 countries and the map shows the countries which have LTE.  It further confirms that new operators and countries are thinking of deploying LTE services and the list includes Nepal too.  THE SPECULATION:  So, basically, there’s some ground as to the availability of LTE in Nepal. From insider news, we’ve come to know that NTC will bring 4G \xa0LTE network by 2015. The announcement can be anytime soon in the first quarter to third-quarter. Moreover, Huawei, the leaders in providing and assisting Ncell and NTC with hardware and other technical departments have launched Honor 6 LTE model in Nepal, which could also be a strong hint. Since there is none better to know about the LTE operation than its hardware providers, we think LTE should soon launch in Nepal.  So that’s all for now, and umm yeah, most of you have seen that 4G sign already on your device, right? Well don’t get crazy, HSDPA+ networks (preferably 3.5G) are also quoted “4G” so that’s what being displayed!  For true LTE experience, we have to wait…but how long, not much, i guess!Have anything to add to this story? Leave in the comments below!  Have anything to add to this story?

The IPS panel of the Honor Holly supports multi-touch upto 10 fingers and the touch sensitivity is good as well. Color reproduction is decent, however the screen isn’t as bright like other mid-range and flagship phones.\xa0Honor Holly screen features a OTP single-screen calibration technique for better HD colors, fast 3D game image processing, and smooth HD movies.\xa0Overall, the HD display is really good for a phone in the Rs 14K price point.         2. Good performer  Honor Holly comes with a MediaTek quad-core SoC running at 1.3Ghz, Mali 400MP GPU and 1GB of RAM.The hardware configuration is almost the same as seen on the Honor 3c hence, like the Honor 3c, Holly is also a good performer and gives you a\xa0lag free experience.  Honor Holly sports a 8MP camera similar to Redmi 1S and\xa0Colors Quad 2. The camera also allows you to capture photos in HDR mode where photos come very good. The 8MP snapper can also record videos in 1080p. There is also 2MP front camera for video calling and selfies.  It sports a 2000mAh battery and you can get a day of battery life with moderate usage. For connectivity, it comes with dual SIM card support(\xa03G SIM and a 2G SIM), Wi-Fi, hotspot, Bluetooth and GPS.  3. 16GB of Internal Storage  One of the best features of the device is that it comes with 16GB internal storage and you get close to 13GB in the first boot. You can also expand the storage via Micro SD card in case you need more.   4. Kitkat 4.4.2 out of the Box  Honor Holly runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat and has Huawei’s Emotion UI 2.3 on top of it. Although Lollipop has already rolled out on Nexus and Motorola devices, but Kitkat 4.4.2 is still one of the latest Android operating system.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0  5.

Many of you saw it live, many of you read it later, many of you might still be unknown about it but Apple Event on September 9 th  was in many ways a beginning of a new era for Apple phones and devices. How? Well, we’ve wrapped it up and made it easy for you to decide it for yourself.   Apple event yesterday saw the launch of two new smartphones, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple watch. While on many ways new iterations of iPhone was a normal announcement, the announcement of smartwatch truly made the headline. Even Tim Cook seemed overly excited about it and so were the people at that event. Let’s sum up the devices in a brief look below:        iPhone 6  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FglqN1jd1tM  iPhone 6 was unarguably the most required change in Apple smartphone era. With an increased screen size of 4.7 inches, iPhone 6 now proudly stands tall along its competitors.  Also the design element is changed with iPhone receiving smoothened edges and continuous design.  Here are the key features of iPhone 6:   NFC  4.7-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit widescreen Multi‑Touch display with IPS technology  1334-by-750-pixel resolution at 326 ppi  New 8-megapixel iSight camera with 1.5µ pixels, ƒ/2.2 aperture which contains Five-element lens with Backside illumination sensor  1080p HD video recording (30 fps or 60 fps)  Slo-mo video (120 fps or 240 fps) & Time-lapse video  1.2-megapixel photos (1280 by 960), ƒ/2.2 aperture, 720p HD video recording with Backside illumination sensor  iOS 8  14 hours of talktime (3G) on battery   \xa0  iPhone 6 Plus   iPhone 6 Plus is another marvel which is similar to its smaller brother except some features and a larger screen size! Yes, you heard it right, it has a 5.5 inch display with Full-HD resolution of 1920×1080 at 401 ppi. It follows similar design element though. The features are nearly same except it has Optical Image Stabilization built in which is a really good move. Plus the battery is larger which gives 24 hours of talktime (3G) on battery as per Apple. iPhone 6 Plus seems to take full advantage of the larger display with enhanced Landscape modes in iOS 8. Also one handed operation is made easier in iPhone 6 Plus which brings the whole screen to half the screen size and can be accessed by simply double tapping the Touch ID.   \xa0  \xa0  Apple Watch  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktujsc4ZUTo  YAAY! Might be the first word for Apple fans when apple announced its smartwatch! It is a really good step forward for Apple since it is a product of its own category. It’s an awesome device, with awesome capabilities and very useful features. But on the design area, I was a bit let down. I would any day prefer the watchface of Moto 360 over Apple’s Watch. Apple has got real talented people in the design department for the likes of Jony Ive and a better overhaul can be expected when smartwatches really start rolling in the consumer market. For now, Apple Watch is a piece-to-admire!   Furthermore, The watch has a new “bubbly” interface specially designed for the watch usage. It is packed with sensors which help in tracking your fitness and help make you healthy. All in all, the Apple watch is a real smartwatch which does everything a smartwatch should do and nothing more. It will be up for grabs from early 2015 at $349. Apple Watch will come in three editions namely: Apple Watch, Apple Watch: Sport & Apple Watch: Edition.  \xa0  Wrapping things up, One more thing (as Steve Jobs says) that apple announced yesterday was Apple Pay. It is a  not so  new way of payment through NFC and Touch ID. Apple says, the data will be stored in a separate chip called Secure Element and will feature a dynamic code method which ensures security. The implementation and viability of this technology is yet to be seen. Although Google Wallet has been doing similar things already this step from Apple looks as if it is here to stay! Also, U2 fans can avail U2’s\xa0latest Album: Songs of Innocence for  FREE!\xa0 (Yes, you heard it right!) from the iTunes Store for a limited period of time!  The iPhone 6 will be available for buying from 19th September with the unlocked version starting from $649 whereas iPhone Plus can be bought from $749!  We expect these phones to come Nepal during Dashain with prices at whooping 95,000/- to over Lakh rupees for the bigger iPhone 6 Plus. After Tihar though, the prices should fall down to the respectable levels and be buyable! That’s how things work here, can do nothing about it! (sigh!)  Lastly, I’m really excited about the larger iPhones; iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus which were the much needed overhauls for Apple Smartphones. Apple watch (though I loved the “iWatch” name) seems to be the first step of the smartwatch culture which we’ll obviously encounter in the near future!  Did you watch the event?  Liked what Apple released? Or didn’t? Have your say in the comments below!  Cheers!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2.jpg']

The Price for this Flagship phone Cost\xa0Rs.29,500. Lets check on our review if this phone is punching above its weight.  OVERVIEW  Colors K22  Octa offers a 5 ″(720 x 1280 pixels ~294 ppi pixel density) \xa0IPS LCD display and runs on a 1.7GHz Octa-Core\xa0MediaTek\xa0 processor with 2 GB of RAM.

Juicing up the device is a \xa0rather scrimy\xa02,200 mAh battery. It currently runs on\xa0Android 4.4.2 Kitkat.  PROS   HD Screen  2 GB of RAM  Runs on Kitkat   CONS   Overheating issues  Battery Life is mediocre   Full Review of Colors K22 Octa         DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY  This device looks sleek and attractive. With protective Gorilla Glass shields on the front, this phone displays a striking design with black and white colour combination. Standing only 8 mm thick and weighing just below 120 gms, it is easy to carry in your hands.However, you will get upset with its cheap plastic body.They don’t seem durable and could be vulnerable when it slips from your hand. Unlike previous Colors phone-K1 and K2,which had a class unibody design, the Colors K22 back is removable and you have an access to the user replaceable battery alongside SIM slots and memory card slots.             SCREEN  The Colors K22\xa0has a 5 inch Ture HD IPS\xa0screen with a resolution of 1,280 pixels by 7,20 pixels, making it a 720p HD screen. Display sharpness can be measured in pixels per inch (PPI), and at 294 pixels-per-inch of screen, it’s\xa0sharp,vivid and bright. However, it only supports 5 multi-touch and the touch gets irresponsive.\xa0The front is also prone to attract fingerprints easily. But perhaps most importantly, it heats up quickly and can get uncomfortable\xa0when calling.   USER INTERFACE  The real star of the show is the \xa0operating system – Android 4.4, codenamed ‘Kit Kat’. It’s simpler, brighter and altogether more attractive.There is no 3rd party apps like we usually find in  Samsung  or HTC phones. The system runs like a dream.             PERFORMANCE  As compared to similar Smartphones in the market, Colors K22\xa0lags a bit on the performance front. This device has a MediaTek MT6592 octa-core processor running at 1.7 GHz. There is no lag while doing simple task but\xa0this device can let you face heating issues during heavy gaming.  With 2 GB of RAM, you wont have any memory issues while multitasking. It has 16GB of internal storage with microSD support. You can move apps and games to the internal storage.  BENCHMARK SCORES  The device scores around 14000 in Quadrant Standard, 26800\xa0in Antutu and 58.5FPS in NenaMark2.             CAMERA  Colors K22\xa0sports\xa0a 13MP rear camera which in my opinion\xa0produces great photos during day light.However, the low light imaging is mediocre. You can can capture photos in different modes like HDR and panorama. You can also record videos at 1080P at 30 frames per second.Overall the performance of the rear camera is good but nothing spectacular. With it’s 5 MP front camera, it produces\xa0good quality of\xa0photo\xa0and things will look clear and has decent amount of details when you take photos or broadcast video from front camera.  BATTERY  Battery is the most disappointing aspect of this phone. With a 2250 mAh battery it has to juice up a true Octa Core phone and a 5 inch HD screen ,so\xa0with heavier usage \xa0the battery performance drops fast\xa0and the phone needed a charge within 7-8 hours.Though, you\xa0\xa0will be able to get 10-12 hours of usage on a single charge when using the phone for web browsing, calls and using apps like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.  AUDIO & CALL QUALITY  Colors K22\xa0performs quite good in terms of sound quality and loudness. It has a single speaker on the bottom edge(Wolfson speaker) but\xa0the placement of this speaker is on the back\xa0so sound get blocked when you place device on table while watching a video.  It has pretty average\xa0call quality, lacking top-end clarity of the best phones. Top volume could also be a little higher. However, calls are still perfectly functional and the phone does have a secondary microphone on its top edge to provide active noise cancellation for calls.  CONNECTIVITY  The Colors K22 is a Dual SIM phone. SIM-1 is 3G+ which means it supports\xa0down-link speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s. SIM-2 is 2G. For connectivity, there is\xa0Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, DLNA, Wi-Fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.0. Moreover, there is a\xa0\xa0USB on the go (OTG).  There is no NFC but there is a Hot Knot feature added on this phone .Know more about Hotknot  HERE  Unboxing of the\xa0Colors K22 Octa    Handset  Ear piece  Wall Charger  Data Cable  OTG cable  Flip cover  Screen Guard  Warranty card  Quick Guide   VERDICT  Colors K22 Octa is a good phone but we are not fully convinced with its performance despite having an Octa Core processor and a 2 GB of RAM. It heats of a lot whle playing and could be really annoying if you are a gamer. Moreover, the battery isn’t that great.  You could go for the  Grand 2  or  Xperia M2  for the same price bracket or you can save some money and buy  Huawei Honor 3c \xa0which has got a better screen, as much RAM and a long lasting\xa0battery life.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSCN1405.jpg']

['Huawei Honor 3c Review: Best Value Midranger?'],"['Huawei', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['July 28, 2014']",2014-07-28 09:05:45+00:00,"['Huawei introduced their much-anticipated Honor 3c smartphones last month here in Nepal and that too at a decent price of NPR.24000(The market value is around NPR. 22500). Let’s check on our review if this phone is punching above its weight.  OVERVIEW  Honor 3c offers a 5 ″(720 x 1280 pixels ~294 ppi pixel density) \xa0IPS LCD display and runs on a 1.3 GHz Quad-Core\xa0MediaTek processor with 2 GB of RAM. On-board you get 8 GB of storage but you can\xa0expand it further with microSD card expandable up to 32 GB.  For taking pictures it comes with an 8 MP Sony BSI\xa0camera with assisted LED flash at the back and a front facing 5\xa0MP camera for selfies. Juicing up the device is a \xa0rather generous 2,300 mAh battery. It currently runs on\xa0Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with Emotion UI on top of it.        PROS   Very good HD Screen  2 GB of RAM  Excellent Battery Life   CONS   MediaTek Processor overheating issues  Emotion UI   DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY  Being a midrange phone, the Huawei honor 3c has all plastic body but the quality of plastic doesn’t feel cheap.The plastic has a glossy slippery back but we wished the back had a matt finish. Standing a 9.1 mm thick and weighing just 140gms, the phone doesn’t feel heavy in the hands.  The power and volume keys are made from metal and feel premium.   \xa0On the bottom, we have a micro-USB port and a microphone.   On the backside, we have an 8MP camera with LED flash and a noise cancellation mic on the top. We have the speaker grill on the left side.   \xa0 The back of the honor 3c is removable and the back cover seems to be durable but a flip cover is always recommended.Inside the phone, we have a 2 micro-SIM slots and a microSD slot for memory expansion. Out of the two SIM slots, one is 3G+ i.e HPSDA 2100 and another is 2G.\xa0  SCREEN  Given the price, the Honor 3c’s greatest attribute is the screen. With HD 720p resolution and a 5-inch display, it has quite a respectable pixel density of 294ppi.The Screen is based on IPS technology and hence it has a good color saturation, decent contrast level and very bright and vivid. The touch of the screen is also very responsive and can support up to 10 fingers. Overall, the screen of Honor 3c is one of the best under its price segment. Only cons about the screen are there is no Gorilla Glass protection.  USER INTERFACE  This phone currently runs on Android 4.2.2 Jelly bean with Emotion UI V2.0 on top of it. KitKat update should be rolling out soon as well. The Chinese version of Honor 3c has already got it so it’s just a matter of time for international users.  The Emotion UI is a bit different. You don’t have an App drawer so all apps are placed on the home screen like in iPhone. There are some cool features added in the Emotion UI. For eg., Networked apps is a great app where you can select which connectivity to us: WIFI or DATA.\xa0Power Saving apps allow you to save battery life to some extent.But the best feature of Honor 3c’s software is the “Knock on”. Double tapping the screen wakes up your phone.  Here are some screen shots of Emotion UI :             PERFORMANCE  The Honor 3c is powered by a MediaTek MT6582 Chipset. There are 4 cortex A7 processor clocked at 1.2 GHz. The Quad Core processor is paired with MALI 400MP2 GPU. It has 2GB of RAM, twice as much as seen in other mid-range handset. We have a 8 GB of internal storage that can be expanded upon by inserting a MicroSD card. Many apps and games can be moved from internal storage to MicroSD.   The performance of this device is fast. You won’t feel lag while running multiple application while scrolling through home screen or browsing. Moreover, the additional RAM comes handy while multitasking.   You can play all source of game, but the rendering and detailing won’t be great as high-end devices.You will notice heating issues on the backside while playing high-end games.   The device scores around 6000 in Quadrant Standard, 17000 in Antutu and 54.3 FPS in NenaMark2.     CAMERA  Honor 3c features an 8MP rear camera which in my opinion produces average photo quality. You can capture photos in different modes like HDR and panorama. You can record videos at 1080P at 30 frames per second. The details of the photo aren’t that bad but the color and contrast level are relatively low. The picture quality falls dramatically in low light but thanks to LED flash, it can take some good shots.\xa0  Honor 3c is a selfie lover’s dream with its 5MP front camera that has a wide angle lens to include all your friends 😉\xa0  BATTERY\xa0  With 2300 mAh battery, the Honor 3c holds enough charge to last for a whole day of normal usage. On the benchmark test, it lasted around 16hrs and we often used WIFI, GPS, Bluetooth and played games for a long time.  AUDIO & CALL QUALITY  Huawei Honor 3c features DTS sound and is loud when played on the speaker. While playing games, the sound is nice and pleasant. However, the call quality is not that great. There is some distortion while calling.  CONNECTIVITY  Honor 3c is a Dual SIM phone. SIM-1 is 3G+ which means it supports\xa0downlink speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s. SIM-2 is 2G. For connectivity, there is\xa0Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, DLNA, Wi-Fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.0. However, there is no NFC and USB on the go (OTG).\xa0  INSIDE THE BOX\xa0    Handset  Ear piece  Wall Charger  Data Cable  Flip cover  Screen Guard  Warranty card  Quick Guide    VERDICT\xa0  Huawei Honor 3c offers premium features at a very affordable price. As compared to Samsung or HTC, it has almost double the specs. The only downside to this otherwise excellent phone is the low-cost MediaTek chipset that heats up occasionally. We wished it was Snapdragon 400!']",[]

Now you could win a Nexus 5 handset every week by making a How-to video about any of the Ncell services.  WHAT IS THIS? This is a new Ncell campaign through which the winner will get a Nexus 5 handset plus 1 GB data ( for 3 months ) and a lucky winner gets the Retina iPad mini.        WHAT IS A HOW-TO VIDEO? A how-to video is a video that is made to explain its viewers about using anything or as it’s name says- “How to do stuffs”. Go on YouTube and you’ll find plenty of these.  SO, HOW TO PARTICIPATE? Well it’s pretty easy peasy. All you have to do is make a how-to video explaining how to use Ncell’s services. They will provide topics for each week\xa0 here . Then submit it by uploading video on the same page. You’re now eligible.  ANYTHING ELSE!? Yeah, actually. There are couple of things you’d like to keep in mind to participate: 1. The video must be in Nepali language\xa0 some terms though can be in English. 2. The video must be less than 45 MB and should be less than 150 seconds. You can use various formatting softwares even Windows Movie maker to reduce your video size. 3. Make sure what you’re trying to show is visible in the video. 4. The audio should be clear enough for the viewers to understand,\xa0 of course. 5. Ncell says that you can participate every week, WOW! 6. No offensive languages must be used… \xa0 of course!!!  Well folks, we’re pretty excited how the participation comes up because we think that not only this competition serves as a marketing campaign for Ncell but also would serve as a huge chance for people to be indulge towards self-made videos.  After all, we’re all tired watching Sajin Maharjan aren’t we!? No offense Sajin, we love you!!!  We would have been happier if Ncell was to let users post their videos on YouTube so that other people could also see this. And would also greatly increase people’s YouTube mobilization on these stuffs (other than watching funny videos and Comedy nights with Kapil).  We encourage all of our readers to participate and do let us know your experience… Cheers!!  Details']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NCELL.jpg']

LG G3 will be priced around NPR.70-75K  The full press release follows below.   WITH NEW G3, LG AIMS TO REDEFINE CONCEPT OF SMART AND SIMPLE  New G3 Builds on Legacy of the Acclaimed G Series with “Simple is the New Smart”  LONDON, May 27, 2014 — LG Electronics (LG) today introduced to the world its eagerly anticipated G3 smartphone, the successor to the company’s well-received LG G2. With launch events taking place in six cities worldwide — London, New York, San Francisco, Seoul, Singapore and Istanbul — LG G3 aims to redefine the definition of a global smartphone for global customers.  Developed under the Simple is the New Smart concept, LG G3 is a culmination of consumer research based on LG’s product development philosophy, Learning from You. The LG G3 was empowered with the best of what current technology has to offer, providing consumers with a user experience more ambitious than anything offered before by LG.  “The smartest innovation in a fast evolving smartphone market is creating harmony between advanced technology and a simplified user experience,” said Dr. Jong-seok Park, president and CEO of the LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company. “LG G3 is the result of our effort to actualize that idea into a tangible product. And we are extremely pleased with the result.”  Highlights of the new G3 include:  – 5.5-inch Quad HD display with 538ppi with four times the resolution of HD and almost two times higher resolution than a Full HD display – 13MP OIS+ (Optical Image Stabilizer Plus) camera with a revolutionary Laser Auto Focus that can shoot stunningly sharp images in a fraction of the time required by conventional phone cameras – Polished metallic skin on the rear cover that is lightweight, fingerprint-proof and most of all, beautiful – Floating Arc form factor that feels incredibly comfortable in one hand and incorporates the innovative design heritage of the Rear Key – Redesigned graphic user interface(GUI) consistent with the Simple is the New Smart concept of the G3  True-to-Life Viewing Experience LG’s reputation in the display arena is second to none and the development of the G3’s breathtaking Quad HD display was the result of years of innovation in display technology. With a pixel density of 538ppi, the G3’s Quad HD display sets new viewing standard producing images that are sharper and clearer than traditional smartphone displays. At 5.5-inches, LG G3 boasts a screen ratio of 76.4 percent with thin bezels all around so the phone feels as comfortable in the hand as a smaller traditional smartphone.  The high resolution display on the G3 also required LG engineers to pair it with battery technology that was just as innovative. LG equipped the G3 with a 3,000mAh removable battery and advanced optimization technologies to further maximize battery efficiency. By replacing the metal in the battery cathode with graphite, LG engineers were able to extend the lifespan of the G3’s battery. The result is a battery that can keep up with the Quad HD display’s ultra-high performance without losing steam in the middle of the day.  Simply Captivating The G3’s advanced 13MP OIS+ camera is designed to quickly and easily capture life’s special moments as they occur, not necessarily when you want them to occur. This is made possible with G3’s innovative Laser Auto Focus, the first of its kind in the smartphone industry. This technology enables the G3 to capture the best moment — even in low light — by measuring the distance between the subject and the camera using a laser beam. So no more fuzzy pictures of your son scoring his first football goal and or missed shots because your camera couldn’t decide quickly enough which toddler in the playground to focus on. Combined with the proven and popular OIS+ technology first seen in the G Pro 2, the G3 is sure to impress even the most discerning shutterbugs.  LG also simplified the process of actually capturing those special moments. Rather than having to focus on the subject in preview mode and then pressing the shutter button, with the G3, tapping the subject to focus will simultaneously also trigger the shutter. What’s more, the G3’s 2.1MP front camera incorporates several new enhancements such as a larger image sensor and larger aperture for more light throughput and better-looking selfies. A unique twist has been added to the standard timed selfie mode by incorporating gesture controls — when ready to shoot, simply clench your hand into a fist and the G3 will recognize the gesture and begin the automatic three-second countdown. It couldn’t get any simpler than that.  For video, the G3 offers superior sound quality with instinctive microphones that measure the environment to identify the optimal audio level for the clearest recording. And with the built-in 1W speaker with Boost AMP, users can enjoy videos and music accompanied by richer sounds and clearer tones.  Balanced andSimplified Design Language The Floating Arc design of the G3 with its ergonomic arch and slim side profile provides an extremely comfortable grip for everyday one-handed use. The Rear Key continues to anchor LG’s innovative design language, with a newly designed power key and volume buttons as well as more premium quality materials and finish. LG also refined sophisticated technical features and advancements located on the rear by arranging them in a clean and singular layout consistent with the G3’s well-balanced design language. The stylish metallic skin with matte finish which keeps the G3 looking clean and fingerprint-free will be offered in five vibrant colors: Metallic Black, Silk White, Shine Gold, Moon Violet and Burgundy Red.  To complement the new external design, LG adopted a minimalistic user interface design with flat graphics. The circular motif of the graphic assets in the new UI was derived from the shape and concept of LG’s logo, reflecting its unique visual style and identity.  Simplified UX to Reflect Simple Pleasures In addition to the advanced core technologies, LG took its Learning from You approach to a higher level with new UX features to offer G3 users a unique experience unlike any previous LG smartphone. Highlights include:  – Smart Keyboard: Adaptive technology learns as you type for faster input with less mistakes. Smart Keyboard reduces input errors by up to 75 percent by tracking and analyzing typing habits and intuitively “knowing” what word the user intended to type. The height of the keyboard can also be adjusted to better fit the user’s hands and position of the thumbs. Individual keys can also be customized with frequently used symbols for even faster input. – Smart Notice: Like a personal assistant, Smart Notice provides suggestions and recommendations based on user behavior, phone usage patterns and location to offer user information when it’s needed the most. Smart Notice can remind you of a call you declined earlier and ask if you would like to call that person back. If you have a large number of un used files or apps on the G3 taking up valuable space, Smart Notice will ask if you would like to delete or uninstall them. But what sets Smart Notice apart from other personal assistants is its natural language capabilities. For example, instead of just displaying today’s temperature and weather forecast, Smart Notice will make a recommendation such as, “You may want to take an umbrella today since it will rain this evening.” – Smart Security: Understanding the importance of maintaining and securing confidential data when smartphones are shared, misplaced, lost or stolen, the LG G3 offers a number of enhanced security features such as:  Knock CodeTM enables users to unlock their device with a pattern of taps. Merging security and convenience, users can create a personalized code that can be entered anywhere on the screen. With the G3, users have the option of being able to use KnockON to wake the screen to check the time as well as enter the home screen directly via Knock CodeTM.  Content Lock keeps personal files safe and hidden from view when sharing the G3 with friends. When the G3 is connected to a PC, Content Lock prevents file previews so the data is still safe. The locked files can reside either on the G3’s internal memory or on the microSD card.  Kill Switch gives G3 owners the ability to disable their phones remotely in the event of theft. The Kill Switch also allows content on the G3 to be wiped so personal information won’t be compromised. Kill Switch also includes antivirus scanning and remote wipe and lock, among other essential features.  LG will also be offering a collection of new premium accessories to accompany the LG G3:  – QuickCircleTM Case: Available in five colors, QuickCircleTM Case allows easy access to frequently used functions such as calling, text messaging, music and camera all from the QuickCircle window without opening the cover. In addition to the QuickCircleTM Case, LG will offer a lineup of Slim Guard Cases and premium Slim Hard Cases to protect the G3 in handsome style. – LG Tone InfinimTM (HBS-900): Developed in collaboration with Harman/Kardon, the Bluetooth stereo headset delivers premium audio quality sound in a stylish design. Built with retractable wire management technology and jog buttons for effortless search, Tone Infinim also features Name AlertTM to verbally notify you who is calling before you answer. – Wireless Charger: Compact and foldable, LG’s Wireless Charger is optimized for easy portability. Compatible with Qi’s wireless power charging technology, the Wireless Charger from LG makes staying powered up as convenient as possible.  Starting on May 28 in South Korea, LG G3 will begin rolling out worldwide on over 170 carriers. Additional details will be announced locally at the time of availability.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lg-g3-fan.jpg']

BATTERY LIFE  Micromax Canvas Turbo sports a 2350 mAh battery which for me is not good enough. The battery, which is non-removable, has to juice up the Full HD 5 inch screen and an Octa core processor. So, the battery is not so powerful. It will work for a day with moderate usage but if you play with your device more often like most of the geeks do, it’s not your phone!  2. RUNS ON ANDROID JellyBean  Micromax Canvas Knight was released when Kitkat was already out on many devices. We can’t understand why Micromax didn’t have Kitkat on their flagship smartphone. Looking at the history,Micromax is not famous of providing firmware updates to their device so, we can’t forecast when they will be rolling out kitkat to canvas knight!   3. HEATING ISSUES  Though the specs are quite good for a price that it offers, but we faced some serious heating issues.

Is it worth buying? Is it not? Find it all here about the Ncell Nexus 5 plan as i take you through the plans’ innards.  WHAT IS IT?  Ncell has introduced Nexus 5  (quite late, i’d say)\xa0 in the Nepalese market. Yes, this is the Google Nexus 5 and they have priced it at Rs. 4388/month ( quite expensive, isn’t it? Well, you might want to hold your thoughts!).  HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?  As per Ncell, the Ncell Nexus 5 plan costs Rs. 4388/month for 24 months. Simple Math says:        Rs.4388 x 24 = 1,05,312  Yes, our eyes are popped too..a whooping 1 freaking lacs for a Nexus which is worth INR 28,690 i.e. around Rs. 46,000 NPR. Hmm.  WHAT! WHY SO MUCH?  I know that’s the question running in your minds right now! So let’s make it easier for you. Ncell are not charging this amount just for the phone. They are giving away some benefits alongwith the Ncell Nexus 5 plan. Think of it as a plan, a contract phone like in the U.S. If you buy Nexus 5 now in the U.S. at contract, you’ll have to pay at least $40-$50 per month for two years. Doing the math, that’s no more than Rs. 4388 that Ncell’s plan costs. And since, Gadget freaks have\xa0 always\xa0wanted \xa0a contract phone in Nepal too, Well, here it is.  HMM…A CONTRACT PHONE. SO, WHAT DO I GET?  There are quite some benefits if you buy an Ncell Nexus 5 plan. Lets list them:   10GB data per month  (worth Rs. 3,000 x 24 = Rs.72,000)  Ncell’s Pro Premium plan \xa0(worth Rs. 1000 x 24 = Rs. 24,000)   So, the Total service worth is= 46,000+72,000+24,000 i.e. Rs. 1,42,000 and you will have to pay Rs. 1,05,312. The tables seem turning, don’t it: We actually save Rs. 36688. BAZINGA!   SHOULD I BUY THIS, THEN?  Well, all i can give is choices. The Ncell Nexus 5 plan seems overly priced, yes it does! But if we grab our calculators and really see what’s inside, we’re actually gaining! But i won’t say this is for everybody!  This is for those, who are an active user of mobile internet. Likewise, the current users of Pro Premium plan might also opt for this plan. This is NOT for those users who sometimes use their 3G data to browse and are not much fascinated about the Ncell plans. So, choose your sides before getting the Ncell Nexus 5 plan. Afterall Nexus 5 is a great phone! 😉  Anyways, Kudos to Ncell, from my personal side for at least starting a Contract-phone ( well, almost)\xa0 in Nepal at a price offered abroad. Had Ncell been able to reduce the cost to 2,500 or even 3,000 to make it suitable for country, This would have been a MEGA-HIT!  What do you think? Will you buy?

The 1080×1920 resolution makes sure that the 5-inch screen doesn’t go wasted.  PERFORMANCE  Performance wise this device was never a let down. I used to have a\xa0 very\xa0 minute lag while changing themes or wallpapers but that can be off-put watching the phone behave while multitasking or playing games. I played quite a few games and noticed no lag. While the relationship between Kirin chipset and benchmarking apps are\xa0 not good yet,\xa0 it managed to pull-up a score of 25575 on AnTuTu, which is definitely not jaw-dropping but is considerable. The phone however, seems to reconcile this with Optimization features inbuilt. With my time on this phone, i had an average of 850MB of RAM freely available which is a very good thing.  EMOTION UI 2.3   The phone operates on Android KitKat OS topped up with Huawei’s own Emotion UI. Well, some people might not like the “iPhone style homescreen” of the Emotion UI but that can always be changed with 3rd party launchers. On the other side there are various apps and functions like\xa0 Suspend, NFC tags, Phone Manager, Simple UI, Ultra Power Saving\xa0 (talked later), etc. All in all it does a good job to compliment the beautiful screen nevertheless.  CAMERA   The Huawei Ascend P7 comes with a 13 MP rear camera with BSI and boasts a 8 MP wide-angle front facing shooter. While this might not be a\xa0 game-changer\xa0 this is certainly worth noticing. The rear camera takes fine pictures with tiny granules sometimes wich can be seen on zooming. The front camera though lives upto its billing with brilliant photo and video shooting. It also has wide lens and captures selfie-panorama too. Both the cameras are capable of taking 1080p videos.  BATTERY  While we had not much hands-on time with the phone to completely judge its battery, we feel that the 2500 mAh battery should keep the juice up and running with  average\xa0 usage for a day at least.  GSMArena  has rated it to 53 hours of endurance rating which means  \xa0the Ascend P7 will last two and a little over two days on a full charge with an hour each of calling, browsing and watching video daily. \xa0Plus there’s a new Ultra Power Saving Mode (accessible from the Notification tray) that makes your phone behave like a feature phone cutting off everything and letting you access to only the basic apps like Dialer and Messaging. This feature, we think, should come really handy in those last percentages of battery.  MULTIMEDIA and OTHERS  We were frankly impressed by the earphones\xa0that came with the unit. They are by far one of the best earphones\xa0that come with an smartphone that i’ve ever seen. Also the Speakers do a loud and clear job with production of sound and gives out decent crisp sounds. Multimedia experience, on the other hand, is really good with the brilliant 1080p screen.   VERDICT  This phone, the Huawei Ascend P7 is up with beautiful slim & light design and packs a punch when it comes to display. The decent Camera and good battery make this phone even more desirable. The only talking point now would be the pricing of the Smartphone which we believe will play a key role in its sales here in Nepal. If it matches the price tag of around 50,000, this phone will certainly be a bang for the buck! With such design, good performance and a decent camera we certainly think this phone is a Glass Class!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN1044.jpg']
['Hands on: Touchkon M602 review'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['May 10, 2014']",2014-05-10 12:38:47+00:00,"['Following the success of its preceding \xa0smartphones, Touchkon has been able to establish itself in the Nepalese smartphone space as a player that offers one of the \xa0best value for its customers’ money Touchkon introduced the M602 a couple of weeks ago at ICT electronics and Branding Expo. We had a chance to play with this device for couple of hours .So, let’s check on our article what’s special about the new phone.  Product Features:   Dual Sim with 3G  5 inches IPS LCD screen with 720 x 1280 resolution (294ppi)  Quad Core 1.2 GHz MT6589 Processor  1 GB RAM  8 GB inbuilt memory; Memory Card up to 64GB  13 MP Rear Camera with flash; 8 MP Front Camera  Android, v4.2  Connectivity:, BT 3.0, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Hotspot  Sensor: Gravitation, Proximity, light  2000 mAh battery  MRP Price: Rs.27,199    Touchkon has been successful in imitating the Huawei P6 design. Thankfully, with the M602, things have changed for the better. The front is dominated by the 5-inch 1280x720p display and with IPS panel and OGS technology; display is vibrant and not overly saturated. The aluminum back is classy and feels premium.        The quad-core Mediatek chipset and Android v4.2 Jelly Bean together make it a decent Android smartphone with smooth performance. But with the price tag of Rs.27000, we expect it to have a Snapdragon processor.  M602 scores 17000 in Antutu Benchmark  The 13MP camera does not automatically put this camera at par with the S4 or the Sony Xperia Z. The images looked good on the phone, nothing spectacular. The 8MP front facing camera however, does a decent job.The 2000mAh battery doesn’t look eye pleasing but we need to check the battery performance.  A brief look of the handling of device is shown in the video below:   CUT TO THE CHASE  Touchkon M602\xa0is good, but there is nothing to justify the price tag. With a price of 27000,you can get MotoG 16GB version or Huawei ascend G700. However,the build quality and design is the best under 30K category.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCN0935.jpg']

['BQ S60 Review: A decent performing smartphone under 20K'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['May 3, 2014']",2014-05-03 04:15:05+00:00,"['BQ mobiles are one of leading manufacturer of mobile phone products and offers quality smartphones to the consumers at affordable prices. They been operating in the India market since 2011 and finally the product is now available in Nepal too. BQ S60 is their flagship model and caught our eye at ICT Electronics and Branding expo 2014. So, let’s check on our review if this device is worthy of rivaling other mid end smartphones like Colors HD, Micromax Canvas Beat and  Karbonn titanium S5 plus .  Pros:  1. Very good IPS Screen  2. Quad-core processor at low price        Cons:  1. Average Camera performance  2. Ugly looking User Interface  AT A GLANCE-BQ S60   Released date:\xa0 May, 2013  SIM:\xa0 Dual (mini SIM); 3G enabled  DISPLAY: 5’’IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen; 540 x 960 pixel ;220 ppi  MEMORY:4 GB internal memory;\xa0 micro SD up to 32 GB  RAM: 1 GB RAM  PROCESSOR : Quad-core 1.2 GHz  Camera: Primary:8 MP autofocus camera, single LED flashlight; Secondary: 2 MP  OS: Android OS v4.2 Jelly Bean  Connectivity:\xa0 Wi-Fi a/b/g/n;Wi-Fi hotspot ; GPS; Bluetooth  Battery: Li-Ion 2200 mAh battery(user replaceable)  Price: 17000/-   IN THE BOX   Handset×1, Battery×1, Charger×1, Headset×1, User Manual×1, Data Cable×1, Warranty Card×1   A brief look of the handling of device is shown in the video below:   \xa0  Design & Build  The design is not so prodigious. It’s a bit bulky but with respect to time, you will adopt with the overall dimension of this device. This device is made from plastic like other 20K smartphones, however there is a chrome finish with metallic bezels at side. The volume and power buttons are feeble and feels very cheap.   Display  BQ S60 sports a 5 inch IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 960 *540 with a pixel density of 220ppi. Though the display is qHD resolution, not HD, but the screen is sharp enough and it looks beautiful. The color reproduction from the LCD panel is fairly good and you won’t notice any pixilation while browsing internet or reading e-books.   User Interface  It runs on Android Jellybean 4.2.2 and the interface is highly customized. BQ runs their own UI named as WE which I personally didn’t like. So, I installed a third party launcher (ADW launcher) and the interface is snappy and fast. The OS is handled pretty well by the handset and we didn’t notice any lags in the overall performance even when we run about 5-7 apps at the same time. Moreover,the overall user experience didn’t alter even I installed over 50 apps, which is good to see on a mid-range smartphone.                Hardware  The Titanium S5 Plus has a MediaTek MT6589 quad core processor ticking at 1.2 GHz and a 1 GB RAM to aid multitasking. It has a POWER VR SGX 544 GPU for graphics. It has an internal storage capacity of 4 GB which can be expanded via a microSD card by 32 GB.You can move apps to external MicroSD card so you won’t go low on memory. Overall, for a price of Rs.18000, the hardware specs that you get are decent. The MediaTek Quad core processor will work well for day to day use and while playing mid end games like Temple run 2.However, you will get problems while playing high end games like MC4, NFS, etc. I personally faced \xa0dropped frame rates and overheating issues after playing it for a lengthy period of time, which is however standard on almost all \xa0budget Android smartphones.  Benchmark Scores  For a smartphone Under Rs.20000, It notches fair good scores. With a tally of around 14000 in Antutu, above 4000 in Quadrant and a 54.1 FPS in Nenomark2, the device is top-notch considering its price tag.      Antutu Scores     Quadrant scores     NenaMark V2 scores      Battery  The most highlight of BQ S60 is its battery life. This device is equipped with 2200 mAh battery and the battery life is great! It will work for more than a day if you are a moderate user.  Camera  BQ S60 could have been a stellar If the camera was great! But ironically it isn’t! The flaw of this device lies on the camera, which on paper says it’s a 8MP shooter but in reality it performs like a 5MP. However, I compared the camera performance with its rivals like Karbonn titanium S5 plus, Colors HD, Canvas 2 plus and all of them were on the same level.   Wrap up  Personally, I would buy this smartphone if I was looking for a good battery life, big 5 inch screen with decent pixels and an above average processing speed. However, if I was more in to photography, BQ S60 is simply not my cup of tea.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20131207_105549.jpg']

['MOTO G: Best Budget smartphone Review'],['Motorola'],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['April 11, 2014']",2014-04-11 04:42:02+00:00,"['Hey guys, I bought the Motorola MOTO G from  Flipkart.com  just few days ago. I bought it for a price of Rs.22500.However you can buy from our partner shop -Digital Electronics,NewRoad\xa0at a price of Rs.24500(16GB) here in Nepal. I have been using this device for couple of days now and on this review I will share my thought on why you should buy MOTO G without any second thoughts!  WHERE TO BUY?   Digital Electronics,NewRoad (opposite of Photo Concern) -Rs.24500 for 16GB model ~  1 year warranty included    Pros:   Excellent pricing  Runs Android 4.4.2, the most recent version  Decent specs for the price  Excellent battery life   Cons:   Non-expandable storage  No Full HD\xa0 recording   A brief look of the handling of device is shown in the video below:         Design & Build  MOTO G has a plastic body with a matt finish. The buttons are made of steel which feels premium. The size is just perfect and feels easy to operate with one hand. Despite its plastic design, it’s actually water and dust resistant device. The back panel is removable but the battery is not replaceable. It would have been great if the battery was removable because a traveller may need an extra battery just to keep their handset juiced up.   One cool feature of Moto G is the colorful accessories that we can buy just to customize the looks of your phone. Overall, the design and build quality is top notch, considering the price tag.                Display  The display here is a 4.5’’ IPS LCD screen with a HD resolution (320 ppi) which is spectacular for a sub 25K smartphone. I\xa0didn’t\xa0face any issues with the screen. The touch is very responsive and the color\xa0reproduction, brightness level & viewing angles are also outstanding.  User Interface  The biggest feature of the Moto G smartphone is the pure Google Stock Android Experience and timely update as it is a Google phone. It currently runs on the latest Android 4.4.4 kitkat (Android L to be rolled out soon)  Hardware  This device is powered with Snapdragon 400 chipset with 1.2 GHZ quad core Cortex A7 processor. It has a less powerful Adreno 305 GPU. So, this device will do fairly “OK” in terms of Gaming.  The major disadvantage of Moto G is it doesn’t support memory card expansion and 8 GB model could well not be enough. So, I would prefer you buy a 16 GB model.   Battery  With a 2070 mAh battery that powers 4.5’’ screen and an average processor, the battery life is great. On a normal day, it will last for more than a day.  Camera  The camera might be the weakening point of purchase for many users. It has a 5 MP shooter with LED flash which is indeed better than 8MP camera of Sony Xperia C, Karbonn titanium s5 plus, colors HD,etc.\xa0 5 MP shooter will do just fine, at least for me.  Wrap up  In a price sensitive market like Nepal, the MotoG appears to be quite the deal. The Moto G has a 4.5-inch (1280 x 720 pixels) display at 329 ppi with scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The Moto G is powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 400 (MSM8226) ARM Cortex-A7 processor clocked at 1.2 GHz with Adreno 305 GPU. Most mid-range smartphones in Nepal by Karbonn, Micromax, Colors etc. are using a Mediatek chipset and not a Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core CPU. The Snapdragon processor of Moto G is much better than the MediaTek processor used on those devices. The 2070 mAh lithium-ion battery offers great battery life too. So, the Motorola Moto G would be the best buy for users wanting to buy a smartphone under 25K.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSCN02801.jpg']

['Windows Phone 8.1: All you need to know!'],['Windows'],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['April 4, 2014']",2014-04-04 04:25:51+00:00,"['Microsoft finally unveils the most-awaited, necessary, functional, demanded (and add more…) update to its mobile OS line-up. Yes, the Windows phone 8.1 is official and it is set to drop jaws with the new update!   Microsoft officially unveiled the latest revision of its mobile platform – Windows Phone 8.1 at the Build Conference yesterday. The new release brings a lot of new features and improvements to the OS. Though many features were already leaked through YouTube videos prior to the launch, the event was still unique and unsurprisingly surprising! Okay, Lets take a Quick Tour of best 5 features as well as major changes from the latest iteration of the mobile OS from Microsoft.        1. Cortana  Undoubtedly, Cortana is the most awesome update Windows phone 8.1 has to offer. Its a voice-guided virtual assistant that helps you through almost anything in your smartphone (just like Siri or Google Now).\xa0The Bing-powered Cortana plays an important role in WP 8.1 letting you set reminders, calendar events, call people, give you information about places you have or plan to visit. She also knows sports, gives weather info and basically everything you would expect from a virtual assistant. She’s going to be accessible through the Search key and features advanced voice recognition. This allows you to ask Cortana to search the web as well.  Cortana can help you with anything and everything.  P.S. To watch awesome Cortana videos and demos head  here .  2. Action Center  Action Center is the notification center in Windows phone 8.1  Windows phone finally get’s its own  customizable  Notification tray (no Live tiles aren’t gone) called the Action Center. It can be accessed by pulling out from top and its a one-stop for all your notifications as well as the quick toggles as seen on Android OS.  3. Customizable LockScreen and Start Screen  Windows Phone 8.1 allows applications to take control over the lockscreen and change the theme or alter its functionality altogether. This could open doors to some serious Lockscreen featured apps.  Moreover, the Start Screen is customizable too. You can add photos as the Tiles background which gives a cool parallax effect while scrolling! Pretty Neat! Also you can display a third row of icons (if you want to) on the same screen.   4.\xa0Word Flo Keyboard  Windows phone 8.1 has got a new and cool keyboard option similar to the Swype Keyboard which they call it “Word Flo”. They say it assists you tremendously while typing.  5. Sense Apps  Battery Power Sense is the familiar app that tracks what software uses the phone’s resources most and gives you a handy overview of how your phone’s battery gets drained.\xa0Data and Wi-Fi Sense will give you greater control over how you use your network. Wi-Fi Sense is a cool new addition that gives you the ability to share the internet connectivity of your secured Wi-Fi networks with your Skype, Facebook and Outlook contacts without having to give the password. It also allows you to find and connect to free open Wi-Fi networks automatically.  Miscalleneous changes:  There are many small changes that have been done to maximize the ultimate user experience. Some of them are:  > Store  Store brings new options and refined user experience.  >Volume Control  >Multitasking improvements  > Navigation Bar  Windows phone 8.1 now supports virtual keys aligned in a bar called the Navigation Bar. It certainly expands the horizons for phone manufacturers to “not include” hardware functional keys in the device.   >Enterprise Solutions  The latest instalment of Windows Phone comes with VPN support. Now, you can punch in your VPN settings into the phone and surf the way more securely. WP 8.1 also supports S/MIME, which allows you sign and encrypt your email.  > Camera changes  The camera app is progressively changed in the Windows phone 8.1. There are more on-screen\xa0toggles and customizable options for the toggles. Also the Camera features three modes: Still mode, Burst Mode and Video mode.  Availability  The Windows Phone 8.1 update will be officially released in a few months (that’s as specific as Microsoft got), while new devices running it will start shipping in late April/early May. It’s not specified which WP8 handsets will be treated to the update at this point, but we guess the list will be quite extensive.  Registered developers though, can get their hands-on the OS as early as April 10th.  We will come up with a video of the features as soon as we get our hands on the OS.  So, what do you think of this major OS overhaul from Microsoft? Let us know!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/feat_wp.png']

Coming to Windows 8.1 in a future update, it has the look of the Start Menu Windows users have experienced for years, but adds the Live Tiles that has been the part of Microsoft products quite a while now! There are no details as to when this update shall arrive for now.        Terry Myerson-\xa0Microsoft’s Executive Vice President of Operating Systems,\xa0made the announcement as part of an example of how\xa0universal Windows apps will be able to run in a window\xa0(and\xa0on Xbox), although users craving something familiar will probably just be happy to see their old Start Menu again.  Terry Myerson:\xa0  Finally, I previewed some work we are doing for the next iteration of Windows, which builds on the journey we began with Windows 8 just over a year ago as well as the releases we’ve done since then. In particular, I showed some early thinking on how the user experience in Windows will evolve in a way that will help developers’ apps make their way to users across devices and form factors.  We set out to do this is a thoughtful way – one where we could enable more productivity for customers working in desktop mode, while building smart bridges to the new modern user experience and ensuring customers can get access to all your great apps in the Windows Store no matter where they are in the experience, or which device type they’re on.  As I said today, these are glimpses of our roadmap, with a particular focus on the parts of our roadmap that are most relevant to our developer partners. We’ll continue to invest in these and many other areas to build a great platform and experiences for developers, customers and partners and you’ll hear more from us when this work is closer to being ready to ship out to the world.  So, is it a YAY or NAY to this addition?? Let us know!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/update_8_1.jpg']

Fortified by the success of smartphone market, Panasonic, the global leader in consumer technologies, has recently entered the smartphone category. Panasonic is better known for its world class electronics home appliances and audio systems. We expect Panasonic smartphones to penetrate Nepalese market before ICT2014.   Panasonic P31, the latest offering from the company is canon in-line with the brand’s promise & tag line  “Play Life, Ur Way “. The company had been heavily teasing the P31 in the run-up to the launch, with each teaser focusing on a particular software feature. With Gesture Play, users can draw to unlock the phone and even get to specific apps by using pre-assigned gestures . Pop-I Player lets you watch a video over any other screen, just like Samsung, LG and Micromax phones. A Music Café app helps in library management and adds additional audio tweaks, while Ultimate Saver helps you manage your battery use and can be tweaked to prolong battery life in emergencies.         Panasonic P31 has a 5-inch display with a disappointing FWVGA resolution (480×854 pixels). We would have hoped for at least a qHD display at this size, but hopefully Panasonic has calibrated the display well enough to eliminate pixilation.

['Karbonn Titanium S5 Plus Review'],"['Karbonn', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['March 30, 2014']",2014-03-30 12:24:21+00:00,"['The Karbonn Titanium S5 plus is one of the budget smartphone of early 2014 to get released in Nepal. The successor of the older Titanium S5 is priced at Rs.16500. The improved and upgraded version has premium specifications for a low price. But is it punching above its weight?  Inside the package of Titanium S5 plus  Pros:  1. Value for money  2. Best design seen on a budget smartphone        3. Quad-core processor at low price  Cons:  1. Average Camera performance  2. Overheating issues while playing High End games  A brief look of the handling of device is shown in the video below:   Design & Build  The design of the Karbonn titanium S5 plus is best you can see on a budget smartphone. You have a glossy plastic build, with a chrome finish on the edges. The back cover is removable and you can have access to the Battery. So, you can carry 2 batteries if you are energy hunger nerd. The plastic build is not rigid, so we suggest you to buy flip cover or a back cover for the protection.   Display  Titanium S5 sports a 5 inch IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 960 *540 with a pixel density of 220ppi. Though the display is qHD resolution, not HD, but the screen is sharp enough and it looks beautiful. The color reproduction from the LCD panel is fairly good and you won’t notice any pixelation while browsing internet or reading e-books.   User Interface  It runs on Android Jellybean 4.2.2 and the interface is highly customized. But the interface is snappy and fast. The OS is handled pretty well by the handset and we didn’t notice any lags in the overall performance even when we run about 6-8 apps at the same time. If you don’t like the User interface, you can always switch to third party launches.                Hardware  The Titanium S5 Plus has a MediaTek MT6582 quad core processor ticking at 1.3 GHz and a 1 GB RAM to aid multitasking. It has a MALI 400MP2 GPU for graphics. It has an internal storage capacity of 4 GB which can be expanded via a microSD card by 32 GB.  Benchmark Scores  For a smartphone Under Rs.20000, It notches fair good scores. With a tally of around 17000 in Antutu, above 5000 in Quadrant and a 61.2FPS in Nenomark, the device is top-notch considering its price tag.      Antutu Scores     Quadrant Scores     NenaMark2 Scores   Gaming Performance  The Titanium S5 plus is capable of running casual games like temple run 2, subway surfers, minion rush with ease. The touch response and the sensors work perfectly fine. However, when we play high end games like MC4,DT2, Asphalt 8 Airborne, etc. the Processor and GPU is incapable of handling it with ease and we will notice dropped frame rates and overheating issues after playing it for a lengthy period of time, which is standard on almost all \xa0budget Android smartphones.  Battery  With a MediaTek processor which consumes less power than other high end processors, the 1800mAh battery will last for a day for average users. But it could have been better if the Battery was around 2200mAh.  Camera  The Titanium S5 Plus makes do with an 8MP rear camera with LED flash which is not better than the 5MP unit of the Moto G in terms of performance. It gets a VGA unit up front. The picture details of the rear cameras are not up to the mark. The color and sharpness are also pretty average. The rear snapper is capable of recording FHD videos. However, the videos produce noise during low light. To conclude, the Camera performs mediocre.             Wrap up  For a budget of around Rs. 16,500, we believe the Karbonn Titanium S5 Plus is more than a decent option if you are looking for good performance and sexy looks. The device performs very well bearing in mind the segment it falls in and we would definitely suggest this smartphone. Go for it!']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSCN0216.jpg']

But no more, Nokia Lumia 630 leaks online in a revealing video, showing off many early looks at what the 8.1 update will have to offer. The video and OS, however, are in Chinese, but its easier to the get the idea of off the video.  Check out the video below for a brief walkthrough of the Lumia device.         The focus here isn’t so much on the Lumia 630 as it is on Windows Phone 8.1, what with its virtual keys, Action Center, and many other big changes noted by WPCentral. Some features that can be observed include a new stock photo apps, stock camera layout, new podcast app and an updated store layout, among many other features. Surprisingly, the one major feature that’s not shown in the video is  Microsoft’s rumored Cortana virtual assistant ,\xa0which we’ve already seen plenty of.   Nokia is promising “more Lumia” at an event\xa0next\xa0week on April 2, so chances are good we’ll get a nice glimpse at the 630, and maybe more. Previous specs we’ve seen rumored for the Lumia 630 include a 4.5-inch 800×480 display, quad-core Snapdragon 400 chip and 1GB of RAM. We might also see the device with a 5-megapixel camera, though there doesn’t appear to be a flash (which is kinda odd!)  What do you think of the device? Excited? Let us know!

It is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 (MSM8928) chipset with a Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A7 processor and Adreno 305 GPU.

['Smart Phones | Is BIGGER always better? |'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['March 9, 2014']",2014-03-09 11:51:43+00:00,"['Smartphones are getting smarter, no doubt. But what is seen as the recent trend in the smartphone world is that the screen sizes are getting significantly larger. With addition of a new term “phablet” phones have found a way to sneak the large plates of screens into the devices that were meant for “calling”\xa0 primarily.\xa0 Normally I’m talking about the phones with the screen size of around and over 6 inches!   But is the larger screen good or just a unnecessary show-off?        Thats for you to decide but lets just go through a quick “pros” & “cons” analysis to at least understand the difference of what it takes in making a large screen phone:  PROS:  A. Entertainment:  Definitely, Entertainment options like gaming and multimedia is what makes the large screen smartphone a choice over average sized smartphone. With larger screen there’s a larger space for watching movies, playing games or even browsing internet.  B. Bigger is Better:  Of course, this refers to a simple analogy that bigger things are always better. Bigger phones means a spectrum of larger canvas to work on.  C. Doodling options:   Since phones like the Note III & LG G Pro Lite are getting “stylus” pen, it offers a way to doodle and draw your imagination on the screen. This cannot be imagined on a small screen whatsoever.  CONS:  A. Energy Hungry:  Larger screen phones are energy hungry. It consumes more battery than a normal smartphone, which is obvious. So make sure you opt for a larger pack of battery or have a extra piece just-in-case.  B. Not Pocket-friendly:  A big issue while buying a large-screen phone is that it wont fit onto your pocket. Thus you end of showing your cornered jeans and a troubled time while sitting or taking and keeping your smartphone. Forget one handed operation, you will have a tough time handling it with two hands!  C. Calling from a large device is NOT COOL!  Well, this differs on opinion but i guess the larger mass feels that calling with a large-screen phone looks dumb. I mean, its funny carrying a\xa0 big-ass  device putting it to you ear (which practically blocks your face). Remember!  What do you think?  Do you own a large screen phone? Happy? Facing problems?

The OGS IPS screen is 5 inches with 1280×720 resolutions.This handset runs on Android 4.3, customarily looks like a stock android, with 1GB RAM and 8GB internal storage.

On the Antutu Benchmark test, it scores higher than the MOTO G so the gaming performance and other processing should be better than MOTO G. In some cases, MOTO G looks like a better device and in some cases, Xolo Q1100 wins it.

['Motorola Moto G vs Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 comparison'],"['Motorola', 'Samsung']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['March 1, 2014']",2014-03-01 14:26:06+00:00,"['Motorola Moto G\xa0and Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 both are available in Nepal at the moment. Both this device offers almost same specs. But because of massive marketing policy from Samsung, Grand 2 looks like a better device on papers but I feel the price of Grand 2 is \xa0Overrated. For a price of Grand 2 ,you can get a Moto G(16GB) and still have around 10K to spare.   Technical Specs Comparison:  [table id=4 /]        Screen :  Moto G has a smaller screen with better Technology in IPS LCD.The viewing angle and color saturation are better because of IPS LCD panel.Whereas in Grand 2,it has a much larger 5.2 TFT screen. The Grand 2 has a much better screen than its\xa0precedence Grand 1. If you are looking for a larger screen, Grand 2 is your obvious choice.However, if you have a tiny hands and want to use it comfortably with 1 hand, Moto G would be perfect for you.  Build : Moto G is a dust and water resistant device but its made of Plastic. Samsung is also made of plastic but it does has a faux leather\xa0on the back. Both this device doesnt look premium like the iphone but you have to consider the fact that they are mid-range\xa0smartphones.   User Interface: The biggest feature of the Moto G smartphone is the pure Google Stock Android Experience and timely update as it is a Google phone. It currently runs on the latest Android 4.4.2 kitkat. Grand 2 runs on Android 4.3 Jelly bean with Touch Wiz UI. The kitkat 4.4 will certainly be availalbe but no specific date has been fixed from Samsung.  Hardware Specs: Both this device is powered with Snapdragon 400 chipset with 1.2 GHZ quad core Cortex A7 processor. It has a less powerful Adreno 305 GPU. So, both this device will do fairly “OK” in terms of Gaming. The major disadvantage of Moto G is it doesnt support memory card expansion and 8 GB model could well not be enough. So , I would prefer you buy a 16 GB model.Whereas Grand 2 has a memory card slot that is expandable upto 64 GB.  Camera : Moto G only has a 5MP camera but it captures decent photos. It can \xa0only record 720P video. Grand 2 has a better camera than Moto G with 8MP shooter capable of FHD recording.  Battery:\xa0 Moto G has a 2070 mAh battery and Grand 2 has a larger 2600 mAh battery. But Moto G has a smaller screen and Grand 2 has a bigger screen so the usage is almost same in both scenerio.  VERDICT: If you want a smaller screen that fits perfectly on your hand for one hand operation and a timely \xa0firmware update, MOTO G would be a wise decision. However , you are in a multimedia stuff and want to watch movies on a bigger screen and want a larger backup on your SD card, you should go for a Samsung Grand 2 .

G2 is the flagship smartphone from LG with a huge 5.2-inch IPS LCD display, Qualcomm’s latest and greatest quad-core processor- the Snapdragon 800, 2GB RAM and a 3,000mAH battery. Can the LG G2 stand against fierce competitors like the ubiquitous Samsung Galaxy S4, the amazingly-built HTC One and other high-end powerhouses like the Galaxy Note 3? Let’s check it out on our detailed review.  Pros:  1. Most powerful phone around  2. Brilliant Battery Life        3. Great 13MP camera  Cons:  1. LG UI  2. No Micro SD support  3. Fairly expensive  A brief look of the handling of device is shown in the video below:   Design & Build  The LG G2 is a very well-built device. Though it has a plastic back but it feels much robust and solid. It is the first Android smartphone to take the initiative to put the side buttons (volume buttons & lock key) off the side and place them on the back of the smartphone. After personally using it for a day, I got used to it and it’s actually easier to use the back buttons especially in a large smartphones like the LG G2. The bezels are very thin and the ratio of size Vs. screen is very narrow. Despite the fact that it has a big 5.2 inch display, it is comfortable to use it with a single hand.   Display  The G2 comes with a 5.2-inch full-HD IPS LCD screen that is bright, offers great viewing angles and has amazing contrast levels. It’s perfect for watching videos, playing games or just day-to-day smartphone stuff. The IPS screen isn’t as eye- dashingly bright as the Super AMOLED screen in the Samsung Note3 but it gives true colors reproduction and nice color reproduction.  Sound  The LG G2 features 24bit, 192 kHz Hi-Fi sound, first smartphone to include this technology. The sound quality is better but not the best. The speaker is located on the bottom edge of the device, along with the microphone. Personally I fell this is a bad design concept, as it covers the speaker with your hand while playing games in the landscape mode.  User Interface  LG G2 runs on Android 4.2.2 Jelly bean as for now, but the Kitkat version will be rolling out soon. Personally, I am not a big fan of LG’s UI.I very much prefer stock android. However, the User Interface is not heavy as in Samsung smartphones. It’s snappy and fast.  App Drawer  Software Features  LG G2 comes with a lot of software features but the most i liked was a  Knock on  feature. By just double tapping your screen anywhere will open or close your screen. This feature will come handy when you are working with a big device like in the LG G2. There are other features too Like: Qslide,Guest mode,Audio/Video Zoom,etc.  Hardware  LG G2 sports a Qualcomm’s latest and greatest quad-core processor- “the Snapdragon 800” that is clocked at 2.26 GHz, Adreno 330 GP, 2GB RAM and 32GB of Internal storage, of which 24 GB is available to the user. In terms of connectivity, there is LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi ac, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 and micro-USB 2.0. The LG G2 is strikingly fast. There is no lag while opening apps, multitasking, playing high end games and boot time is insane. It takes about 5-7 seconds for this phone to boot. The LG G2′s boot time is the best I have ever seen.  Battery  We have no complaints about the battery performance of this phone. Equipped with a huge 3,000mAh non-removable Li-Polymer battery, it’s capable of running for a day in heavy usage and for more than a day in light/moderate usage.  Camera  Key Photographic / Video Specifications  • 13MP 1/3-inch CMOS sensor  • F2.4 lens  • Optical Image Stabilization  • 1080p/60fps video recording   LG G2 rear camera is a 13MP camera with Optical Image Stabilization. The camera is armed with backside illumination (BSI) for low-light sensitivity and capturing good shadow detail, and the optical image stabilization eliminates hand shake. What I loved most about this camera was the software, though. You get your regular shots, HDR, panorama, VR panorama (LG’s version of Photosphere), burst shot, time catch Dual Camera mode,etc. The Front facing camera is a 2MP shooter capable of FHF video recording. It performs decent job for video chat or selfies. You can view the full gallery of the Camera Samples\xa0 here.  Gaming Performance:   The G2 is one of the fastest smartphone I have ever used, and we have never noticed even the slightest of lags or dropped frame rates while playing high end games and the highest resolution possible. Here’s a Video on the gaming performance:  LG G2 gaming review  \xa0  Benchmark Scores:  The Bench mark score is the best i hve seen in any smartphones upto date.It scores a whopping above 36000 in Antutu, above 19000 in Antutu and a 59.2 FPS in Nenomark.  Antutu Benchmark  quadrant Benchmark  Nenomark Benchmark  Wrap Up:  So should you buy it ? Definitely Yes!! It’s one of the best smartphones at the moment. It is super responsive; it has an amazing display, excellent battery life and a unique design. For me these are the most important aspects of a smartphone and LG G2 scores excellent in all these aspects.

I consider my self to be an enthusiast – I read Android Magazine, after all – and I am both competent and confident at working with computer on quite technical things, I just don’t feel that I want to root it. U also get a little bit annoyed that whenever anyone points out a problem with android the default reply is: “Root it, Flash a ROM, Fixed.” Why do we allow manufactures and software developers to get away with producing buggy or under performing products just because an elite bunch of users are happy to fix it themselves.\xa0 Nobody expects iPhone user to have to jailbreak just to fix things, anymore than you’d be required to rewire your toaster. I’ve got better things to do than flashing ROM’s and re-installing my apps afterward. I’d rather keep my warranty in tact and let the manufacturers do what they are supposed to do what they are supposed to be good at.  We say:  We see many articles that say that rooting helps the mobile phones good. We agree with you that it isn’t substitute for a properly working phone right after opening the box.

['LG G Pro Lite Review: A phone for Lite Business Users!'],"['LG', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['February 15, 2014']",2014-02-15 12:55:16+00:00,"['LG G Pro Lite is a phone for business users!                  LG is a leading consumer tech manufacturer in the world. A wing of its company- LG mobile has been manufacturing various smartphone to cater the needs of general mass. From average smartphone users to high-end geeks, LG mobiles have been providing gadgets to serve all these categories. Shadowed in the likes of iPhone, Samsung and Nokia, LG phones are trying their best to sustain in this cut-throat competition in the smartphone market.  In Nepalese market though LG’s have had an efficient penetration in the budget range. Distributed by CG Electronics, LG mobiles are offering various range of “L series” “Optimus Series” and the recent “G series” smartphones.  One of these smartphones is the LG G Pro Lite  Dual.  This Dual SIM smartphone fits into pockets of the average mid-range user at its price tag of Rs. 34,199 and is a best match when it comes to a large screen device at its range.        Pros:   A large 5.5-inch display  Wonderful Battery  Stylus pen  Low-light camera   Cons:   Average Gaming performance  LG UI  Lesser internal memory   A brief look of the handling of device is shown in the video below:   \xa0 Design   The LG G Pro Lite Dual has a standard body as seen in the Samsung smartphones. By standard, we’re talking a normal poly-carbonate back with a plastic body and a “metallic” bezel around the smartphone’s body.  The left is accompanied by the Volume rocker buttons and a dedicated customizable shortcut button. On the right there is the Power/Lock Key. Below the device you can find the micro-USB port, Dual Speakers and a microphone, whereas the top is accompanied by 3.5mm headphone jack, a noise-cancelling secondary mic and an infra-red for remote controlling your TVs and DVDs.  The back panel is accessible though, with a casing for a replaceable large 3140mAh battery, two GSM SIM cards and microSD card.  The phone has a regular profile and light in hand to hold.  Display   The LG G Pro Lite Dual has a 5.5-inch IPS display on board with a qHD display. This way the pixel count goes to as much as 200 ppi. Though the pixel density is not that high, I was comfortable with the screen. The only time you could see a pixilation is when you’re reading or browsing the internet, that too in a minimum level.  The viewing angles are good too but the screen is prone to smudges and sunlight glares. The brightness of the device is well-enough to provide lighting in interiors but under direct sunlight you mayn’t be able to read text’s and images.  Software / User Interface  The software behind the LG G Pro Lite Dual is a normal Android Jelly Bean 2.2 with a tweaked LG UI. I’m not a big fan of the UI though I really appreciate the way the settings menu is tabbed for easier navigation.  The features like QSlide offers a way of multitasking which takes advantage of its large 5.5-inch display. Also, the QuickMemo features are well versed with the Stylus pen onboard. This is really good for taking quick notes and doodling if you like to paint on your phone.  The app drawer is normal and the customization features are plenty. I always equipped my device with the “dodol launcher” so, UI looks was never a problem for me. Adding on to that, the Easy Home feature of the LG UI is a good one since it allows you to use your phone as a large-keypad-phone; very good for aged and visually disabled persons.  The stock softwares like Guest Mode allows you to select apps to be run when a third-person uses your phones. A very good addition as the “Kids Corner” found in Windows phone 8 devices.  Plus there are stock softwares like Smart Share, Photos which only add to the productivity this phone has to offer.  Reports are that this phone will be receiving KitKat upgrade really soon, so that’s a plus point!  Hardware  This phone is powered by Mediatek Cortex A9 processor, which handles apps and the OS pretty well. It’s a Dual-core 1 Ghz processor which is better than the Cortex A7 processor found in average mid-range devices. The Graphics is handled by the PowerVR SGX531 GPU which was disappointing in my experience. I got really low scores in the benchmark tests which I’ve posted below. The phone has an AnTuTu score of 8406 which is just “Not too bad” according to AnTuTu. While ranking it with mediocre LG Optimus 2X I got “okay” results. The proecessor does pretty well but the downside is definitely the graphics.  The internal storage is of 8 GB but you will have around 3.5 GB of extra space after you install your essential apps and the space the phone OS will take. So storage freaks are advised to pop-in the microSD card and since apps and games can be installed there, it shouldn’t be a problem.  LG G Pro Lite Dual features a Stylus pen which is pretty basic unlike the one you see in Note 3 but hey, you can’t compare a 70k device with this one, can you? Its good in taking notes but is slightly less responsive.  While the graphics is a downside of this device there’s an A+ side too and that’s its battery. It’s powered by 3140 mAh of battery which will get you a day and a half of normal usage without charging. If you surf regular internet and watch HD videos or play games back-to back this phone should easily give upto 8 hours of life which is really appreciable given its screen size.  Camera   This phone has an 8-megapixel shooter in the back capable of recording good photos and 720p videos. I found no problems in the camera whatsoever though the low-light photos were not that great. But the best part is its “Night-mode” which dramatically balances the exposure at low-light and gives you a perfect photos, even in low-light.  The front is equipped by a 1.3-megapixel shooter which is not a game turner but is good for selfies and instagrammers.  You can view the\xa0 full gallery of the Camera Samples here .  Gaming Performance:  As the graphics of this device is at average, you can’t expect much from Gaming with this boy. Its like this phone was designed with overall performance in mind rather than the regular hard-core gaming.  Having said that, this phone still handles mid-range games like Temple Run and Subway Surfers but has a hard-time playing High-end games like Asphalt or Modern Combat.  WRAP UP:  With an excellent battery, a good camera and a “okay” gaming performance,\xa0 I think this phone is for those who are not much into gaming but would love to Facebook or use other apps or even browse the internet. A hardcore geek would not like this device but a medium-user will have no problems whatsoever with this guy.  So, will you buy this device, or already own one?

Amid reforming its TV arm (and splitting it into a standalone entity by June 2014), it’s going to sell its PC business and VAIO brand to Japan Industrial Partners (JIP), with the final deal set to be done by the end of March 2014. The company has reported a\xa0drop in demand\xa0for its PCs in prior financial statements, and (barring the\xa0VAIO Flip 11A), Sony didn’t really have much to show from its VAIO range at this year’s CES. During the earnings call today, CEO Kaz Hirai said that it was an “agonizing decision”, and that it was “a very Sony brand… It stirred up the PC market.”   The company says it’s no longer designing and developing PC products , while manufacturing and sales will wrap up after the company’s final VAIO range goes on sale globally. It has decided to focus on those post-PC products (yep, smartphones and tablets), meaning that it had to make some big decisions with less successful parts of the business. During Q3 2013, it saw “significant profit improvements” compared to the same period last year. Sony saw year-on-year sales increases from its mobile arm, but still forecasts an annual loss of around $1.1 billion (110 billion yen) for the full year: it had previously projected a 30 billion yen profit.        Sony will cut a total of 5,000 jobs worldwide (1,500 in Japan) by the end of the 2014 fiscal year, while the new PC company has stated that it will hire around 250 to 300 Sony employees, encompassing design, development manufacturing and sales, and will be based in Nagano — where Sony’s current VAIO HQ resides. The company is promising to fulfill all its aftercare warranties. Sony is signed up to invest 5 percent of the new company’s capital to support its launch and smooth over the transition. Restructuring costs across both the TV and PC segments are now set to cost an extra 20 billion yen. Sony is now set to focus on its\xa0high-end sets\xa0and\xa04K screens, and hopes that changes will ensure the TV business returns to profitability within the next financial year.  Well it feels horrible to know that we won’t see any SONY VAIO PC’s anymore! Since, your warranties will still be available even after the split, you have lesser to worry.

['Nokia Lumia BLACK Update rolls out Worldwide!'],['Nokia'],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['January 10, 2014']",2014-01-10 05:07:30+00:00,"['Good news (Nokia’s) Windows Phone owners, Nokia Lumia has announced its latest software upgrade called the “Lumia Black” update!  The update was first rolled out to the users in the USA but now Nokia has made the update available to Lumia owners all over the world. As we were expecting this sort of release soon, its nothing but jubilant to have this release at this point of time. Earlier, Nokia had made it clear that the update would be available to the current Lumia owners. However, Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 already have the Black update installed.  The following is a hands-on and feature-walkthrough video about the Black update:        \xa0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzxSo-pI-YE  \xa0  The Windows Phone 8 upgrade is reaching the\xa0Lumia 925\xa0and\xa01020\xa0first; other devices should get it in the weeks ahead. The fresh software brings common features like app folders, Bluetooth 4.0 LE support, an updated Glance screen and the unified Nokia Camera app. Some improvements depend on beefier hardware, however. You’ll need at least 1GB of RAM to use Beamer transfers or\xa0Refocus\xa0image processing, and only 1020 owners can\xa0shoot RAW photos. Whatever device you’re using, you’ll want to hit that Phone Update option in the near future, you may be in for a pleasant surprise.  HOW TO UPDATE?  The Lumia Black update has begun rolling out now for Lumia 1020 and Lumia 925 smartphones, with other models in the range following in the coming weeks. To check if its available in your device or not,\xa0you can go to Settings -> Phone update and check for yourself. If Lumia Black is ready for your phone, you’ll be able to download and install it straight from that screen.  The latest update will pack the following features:  App Folder .  This brand new feature makes your Lumia experience even more fluid by giving you an option to further personalize and organize your Start screen. With App folders you can group similar apps and settings into one folder, a tile, on your Start screen.  Nokia Glance screen 2.0 .  Helps you keep track of information in real time, making all your most important notifications including: phone, messages, email, outlook, calendar, or any apps that use notifications such as Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp, or games; always visible at a glance on your screen. It saves you time and energy.  Bluetooth LE .  It will now be enabled across the full Windows Phone 8 Lumia range for compatible gadgets like the Adidas MiCoach accessories.  Nokia Refocus .  The Nokia Refocus comes to all Windows Phone 8 Lumia smartphones with 1GB of RAM and upwards.  Nokia Beamer .  No longer restricted to just photos, you can now beam documents, presentations, anything you like, to any HTML5-enabled screen by simply scanning a QR code on the screen. It’s coming to all of the phones with 1GB RAM upwards.  Nokia Storyteller .  This app\xa0debuted on the new Nokia Lumia 1520 and Lumia 2520 late last year. Now the experience comes to other Lumia smartphones. The app arranges your photos for you, by date and by place, making it easier to tell the stories behind your pictures, and give extra context through the close integration of interactive maps.  Nokia Camera .  Combines Nokia Pro Camera and Smart Camera to simplify the photo-taking experience, and ensure you get the perfect shot every time.\xa0The app\xa0has been available for Lumia PureView smartphones since last year, but it’s now coming to the rest of the WP8 Lumia range.  Latest generation of imaging algorithms .  The Lumia Black update further improves the image quality, especially in Lumia 1020. Among others, the improvements include a new oversampling algorithm, making your images more natural looking with reduced noise, while ensuring your photos remain wonderfully sharp.  The Lumia Black update also brings a series of enhancements from Microsoft to Nokia Lumia smartphones. These include safe driving mode – which cuts out unnecessary distractions when you’re on the road; customised ringtones for each contact. You can now also close apps within the in multitasking view and lock the screen rotation if you wish.  “Nokia Lumia Black updates the imaging experiences on your Lumia and makes using the Windows Phone even more fluid. New App Folders and the ability to close apps in multitasker are my personal favourites. I also encourage everyone to try out the Nokia Refocus app that introduces a whole new dimension to photography,” says Samuli Hänninen, vice president of software program management for Nokia’s Smart Devices business.

['Subisu IP TV in Nepal'],[],['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['January 3, 2014']",2014-01-03 14:34:47+00:00,"['Introducing Subisu IP TV in Nepal \xa0\xa0  The hot news from CAN is from the title sponsors SUBISU, who have launched the idea and a demo of “IpTV” in Nepal.  Leading provider of Cablenet and also a major ISP, SUBISU plans to launch this IPTV very soon (around April). This is a very welcoming news to all of us, since the dangles of cables for watching TV will be fargone with this concept. With this service one could easily watch any channel of their choice on the go! And don’t worry, this service will work under any internet provider: ADSL, Broadlink, WORDLink, etc i.e. you don’t have to have Internet services from SUBISU ( but you’ll need to subscribe to IPTV service, of course! )        SUBISU says, YOU WILL NOT NEED A ‘CABLE’ TO WATCH TV!  Internet Protocol television \xa0( IPTV ) is a system through which\xa0television\xa0services are delivered using the\xa0Internet protocol suite\xa0over a\xa0packet-switched network\xa0such as the\xa0Internet, instead of being delivered through traditional\xa0terrestrial,\xa0satellite\xa0signal, and\xa0cable\xa0television formats.  The Internet protocol-based platform offers significant advantages, including the ability to integrate television with other IP-based services like high speed Internet access and VoIP.\xa0In a typical TV or satellite network, using broadcast video technology, all the content constantly flows downstream to each customer, and the customer switches the content at the set-top box. The customer can select from as many choices as the telecoms, cable or satellite company can stuff into the “pipe” flowing into the home. A switched IP network works differently. Content remains in the network, and only the content the customer selects is sent into the customer’s home. That frees up bandwidth, and the customer’s choice is less restricted by the size of the “pipe” into the home. This also implies that the customer’s privacy could be compromised to a greater extent than is possible with traditional TV or satellite networks.  Technical Representiveof SUBISU, Mr. Ravi gave his time to chat with Gadgetbyte today. He said,” This is a concept where anybody who has an internet connection can watch TV on their TVs, Tablets or even Smartphones. All it takes is downloading an app or setting up a Box”. According to him, this service could be availed through two ways:   By downloading an app (On the go)  By setting up a box (For home usage)   These apps could be downloaded from the OS marketplace and anybody could watch TV even over 3G after subscribing to SUBISU’s IPTV Service. But those who want to avail these services at home or don’t have a SMART TV could simply set-up a box and enjoy this service. These channels will be hosted by SUBISU’s local server so one shouldn’t be wary of Speed or buffer limits. He says that the channels will practically be buffer-free!  This is a pretty welcoming news, however we couldn’t get any information over the pricing! SUBISU plans to announce prices at the time of launch but says the prices will be in competitive range.  Want to see this “futuristic” idea yourself? Well, head in to CAN Infotech in the main dome and i don’t think we’ll need to navigate you to SUBISU, you’ll find them on the center stage!']",[]

This device has opened a new chapter, a new direction and an existing world of possibilities. It is a engineering marvel and something that redefines tomorrow.  The Samsung Galaxy Gear comes in six colors including vivid yellow and orange versions. With an aluminum face and a rubber wrist strap which is adjustable, it feels really comfortable much more premium. The Samsung Galaxy Gear has 1.63” super Amoled display with the resolution of 320 X 320 pixel. It has 800 MHz single core processor with 512 MB RAM, 4 GB of internal storage and 315 MaH battery. The strap has very delicately placed 1.9 MP camera and speakers is placed on the clasp used to lock the gear in the wrist.\xa0 On the left side of the watch (gear) there is button which is the home button / S-voice activator (this option is changeable) and followed below the home button there is a microphone.\xa0 Every part of the gear has been beautifully engineered.\xa0 The Galaxy gear is provided with a charging dock which has a micro USB charging port. The gear is connected using the latest Bluetooth technology 4.0. The gear is constructed with gyroscope and accelerometer so that the gear can respond to the gestures and moments of the user.         With the intelligent camera placement in the gear it has made a whole lot easier for the user to capture moments and that just in a swipe touch. The placement of the speaker and microphone is positioned so arithmetically that it is the same as picking a virtual phone into \xa0our ear. Samsung Gear takes around 90 min to fully charge and has the lifespan of 25 hours which is a kind of disappointing. The Bluetooth range is good, the user got around 150 meters before the Gear buzzes like an electronic tag to notify us that the Gear has gone too far from the phone.  Here’s the Video review of the Samsung Galaxy gear :   The Samsung Gear is totally controlled by the Samsung gear manager which is installed in the Samsung Galaxy Note III. At the time of writing this review, the Samsung Galaxy Gear is only compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 but Samsung has promised to add the Samsung Galaxy S4 , Samsung Galaxy S III and Samsung Galaxy Note II (via software update) by the end of October.']",[]

Colors claim that Gionee are their vendors for phones.  With a Full HD screen, Quad core processor, 2 GB RAM& a 13MP camera, Is Colors\xa0K2 the best Android smartphone in its price range(Rs.23500)? We find out in our detailed review.        Don’t forget to checkout the video review below:  Colors K2 Review   Design  The Colors K2 Pearl Black has\xa0a premium unibody design with a polycarbonate build. We were really surprised with its glossy unibody form factor and slim design, not usually seen in mid-range smartphones.  However, there is no access to open the back panel, therefore no access to the battery, which might be disappointing for users who want to use an extra battery in case they need one.  Display  The Colors K2 Pearl Black features a 5-inch full HD screen with a resolution of 1080×1920 pixels. It has a IPS screen based on One Glass Solution (OGS) technology with a Gorilla Glass 3 layer for protection. The screen looks bright and lively, looking exceptionally good and sharp as well. However, color saturation will look to be faded.\xa0Viewing angles looks good. Overall the screen is brilliant.  User Interface  The Colors K2 Pearl Black runs a slightly tweaked version of Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean. Some of us may like Stock android experience, but Colors preferred to add their own customized UI on the top of Android.  There is no Official news for Kitkat 4.4, the latest version of Android. That’s a worrying factor for many customers because they want to live with a dream of using the latest software as soon as possible. Hopefully, Colors will come with the official news on Kitkat 4.4  Hardware  The colors K2 Pearl Black is powered by a 1.5GHz Mediatek MT6589T quad-core processor and a PowerVR SGX 544MP GPU.\xa0It has 2GB RAM with a 32GB of internal storage (23GB user available). There is no microSD card slot, which is in fact a big disappointment for users who want to store Movies and pictures in large magnitude.\xa0The device is powered with 2000mah Battery, which might not be enough considering the fact that it runs a 5 inch Display.  Camera   The colors K2 Pearl Black has a 13-megapixel auto-focus camera with a second generation BSI sensor for low-light imaging. The phone comes with a modified Camera app and allows you to capture photos in HDR and Panorama modes as well.  The camera of the colors K2 Pearl Black takes good photos in day light. But the low light imaging was pretty average. Moreover, with shaky hands it captures Blurry images sometimes.  The 5-megapixel front camera also takes decent shots and is great for video calls.  You can view the  full gallery of the Camera Samples here .  Gaming Performance:  The colors K2 Pearl Black have an above-average gaming performance. It can run mid-end games like Temple Run 2 , Subway Surfers, etc. with ease but you might notice slight lag and dropped frame rates while playing high end games like Mortal Combat 4, Dead Trigger 2,etc.   But considering the price tag you have to forgive this kid.  Check out the gaming review here in this video:  Colors K2 Gaming Review   Pros:   Full HD screen  Better Build quality and design  Price tag   \xa0Cons:   Non-removable Battery  No Micro SD card slot.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/k2.png']

As we all know that the year of the “doomsday” 2013 is finally coming to an end in a matter of few days. With Christmas gone, all the jollity and excitement of the year is coming to an end in few days. But though it was not a year that the world ended, I think this year remarks the doomsday of the smartphones as they got bigger, just got bigger!  Call me crazy but I am not so satisfied with the smartphones that came out this year. Frankly speaking tell me one new innovation: revolutionary and evolutionary thing that happened this year with the smartphones! Scratching you head right, i was too! YES! YES! YES! We have a 6-inch display device, we have cool tablets and of course we don’t need Password to open our phones! But hey, is that too groundbreaking? Not for me! I was expecting things, some serious things by the manufacturers this year but i got disappointed!  You’re right i don’t call the “Blow to Unlock” or some gesturing features in the smartphones revolutionary. With all due respect to the manufacturers and technical people who put much effort to putting these features all together in a smartphone to make them even better or you may say User-friendly, I’d say that none of this is so “ground-breaking”. I don’t see the point how the feature of “pausing a video when you look away” is ground-breaking. I talk and see my friends’ faces while showing them a super-cool video, Oh wait! It just got paused!! BOOOOO!  So, what do you want Bishwash, you might ask? I want things to be innovative. Things that would change the way you interact with smartphones. Change the way smartphones are or were. Change the way that smartphones interact with us. Maybe throw some flexibility, transparency or even some wearables. Except Google glass nothing was so extraordinary in the gadgets world this year. And I’d like to take this moment and appreciate Google Glass because I don’t know if it will be useful but it’s certainly exciting and innovative to use something like glass in a different way. That’s what I want to see.        Hopefully my wishes will come true on 2014 or maybe I should have wished before Christmas (haha)! But hey, I was wishing all this year for something that would break my heart and I’d say, “Man, that’s something!”  It should happen because I’m practically bored with smartphones just getting bigger and having minor upgrades in their hardware.  Let me know what you think!  Cheers!']",[]

But nevertheless, it has been doing an excellent job with Smartphones and Phablets, yeah I’m talking about Note 3. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 is the latest iteration by Samsung in the tablet market.  Recently we had a chance to see this boy the Galaxy Tab 3.7.0 SM-T111. Though Apple fanatics will not even consider looking into this line-up, I have some different opinion.  Yes, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 may not be as \xa0good as an iPad mini Retina but might be worth a shot. Featuring 1 GB RAM and up to 32 GB of storage (with microSD support), this is certainly not a bad buy for starters.        You can go through the glimpses about what this smartphone has to offer below:-  KEY FEATURES of Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 :   Size:\xa0110.9 x 187.9 x 99mm, 300g  SIM: Micro-SIM (3G)  Display:\xa016M colours 7″ TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen of 1024 x 600(WSVGA)  OS:\xa0Android 4.2 Jelly Bean  CPU:\xa01.2 GHz,\xa0Vivante GC1000\xa0graphics accelerator, 1GB of RAM  Camera:\xa02 MP Autofocus rear camera (720p video recording)  Memory:\xa08 GB internal memory, microSD card slot  Battery:\xa03600mAh (Up to 7 hours of video playback)  Market price: Rs.27000/-   Here’s our video review of the gadget, make sure you check it out!:   DESIGN:  The tablet is well designed, a rigid feel nonetheless with a trademark Samsung back plastic. With galaxy note receiving a face-lift, I was not that surprised with the design of the tablet and hence mark it just fine for the build. On the right, you could see the Volume rocker and Lock buttons, which is indeed made of the metal that surrounds the body of the tablet as a ribbon. Below there is the micro USB charger and two stereo speakers and the top is equipped with a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack.  USER INTERFACE:  With Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, there’re not much OS features to talk about however the tablet feels quite snappy and just about does the job it is intended to. The call and messaging apps are pretty basic but quite snappy.  CAMERA:  The camera is the minimal agenda in the tablet manufacturer, at least, this tablet proves that. With just 2 MP okay shooting camera in the rear and a no shooter on the front nothing big can be expected. You won’t be able to Skype your friends!  BATTERY & STORAGE:  With 3600 mAh of Battery, Power shouldn’t be a problem. Samsung says that you can get 7 hours of video playback which is not that WOO factor given that normal seven inches give you 8-9 hrs with an ease.  On the storage, you have an 8GB internal space with up to 32GB of expansion possibility.  WRAPPING UP:  Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 is good tablet anyways and perfect for starters, so don’t expect a big thing out of this and don’t be disappointed as well. The best part would be the expandable storage and the functionality of the tablet and on the downside, I’d quote the camera and the build.It would be better if you wait for few days before Samsung Tab 4 and Tab pro series arrives in Nepal  Also, although I am waiting eagerly for Samsung Galaxy S5\xa0which is set to be launched on April 11,2014 here in Nepal.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tab.png']

However, unlike superior Super AMOLED technology, Samsung has opted for a cheaper TFT panel here. It is also a 720P 16:9 display, hence it results in a mere 280ppi. That being said, it is still a superior display as compared to its predecessor.  On the performance front, it runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC. It is the latest mid-range chipset with quad-core Cortex A7 cores and Adreno 305 GPU. Paired that with 1.5GB of RAM, it should run most of the mid-tier games with ease. However, the Snapdragon 400 chipset is found on even cheaper devices, so maybe they could have gone with a better 600 series SoC.         There’s 8GB of eMMC storage and I personally think Samsung could have provided a bigger 16GB storage here. However, the microSD card slot is still present here.\xa0Similarly, there is an 8MP primary shooter and a 1.9MP selfie camera here. Since Samsung usually ships with good optics, we can expect the performance of the camera to be good for the price.  Design-wise, we are looking at fake leather-like plastic back, but it does feel unique as compared to boring mid-range phones of 2013. The front houses a button that works as a button like any other Samsung phone.  It runs on the latest Android 4.3 Jellybean with Touch wiz UI layered on top. Given the software update history, it should get the recently announced 4.4 Kitkat very soon. Finally, it has a 2600mAh battery which is user-replaceable.

If you remember, the phone was launched by Hollywood superstar  Hugh Jackman . But now here at CAN-infotech 2015, the price has reduced to  Rs.15000  which makes this phone worth every penny.

They have added a metallic cover which looks solid than a standard plastic cover. With a dimension of 5.05 x 2.80 x 0.34 inch, it feels much balanced and more compact than their preceding series.         Display  Finally, we get to see a Full HD display from Micromax. With a resolution of 1920 x 1080 bringing in a wonderful 441ppi pixel density, the screen looks pleasing but Micromax still has to improve their color saturation and brightness levels .It has pretty good viewing angles. We were also a bit disappointed that they didn’t have a gorilla class protection.  Hardware:  Powered by 1.5GHz Quad core processor from MediaTek Cortex-A7 (MTK 6589T) and a GPU of SGX544 is better but not the best. When it comes to playing games, it can play casual games with ease but when it comes to high-end games Like MC5, Riptide2,Real Racing 3 etc. we can see some lag and dropped frame rates.  It has a 2GB of RAM which is admirable. It has a 16GB of internal memory but there is no external SD which is, in fact, disappointing.  Camera:  The rear camera is 13 MP with autofocus supported which can record 1080p video at 30 fps. It has 5 MP front camera mostly used for HD video chat. The day light performance of the camera is very good and low light performance is also quite decent.  Software:  The Micromax canvas turbo offers a jellybean 4.2.1 out of the box, which is almost stock android. There isn’t much customization like in Samsung mobiles. The interface is clean, snappy and fast.  Pros:   Better Build quality and design  Full HD display  Cost Effective   Cons:   Average Gaming Performance  2000mah battery might not be enough compared to its 5-inch display.  No Micro SD card slot.']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/micromax-canvas-turbo.png']

['Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Review: The Best Phablet Out There'],"['Reviews', 'Samsung']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['November 20, 2013']",2013-11-20 15:40:04+00:00,"['Samsung ‘s latest flagship, the Galaxy Note 3, is finally here in Nepal. The latest phablet launched by Samsung couple of months ago is the most expensive Android smartphones you can buy in Nepal. With a price tag of Rs. 86,900, this phone is a beast in terms of specs, Design, and s-pen. But, is it worth all the money? We review to find out.  [Note: I used the Note 3 for 2 months as my daily driver]  Design         The Galaxy Note 3 is much larger than what we have seen in GS4 or HTC one. It’s slightly bigger than Note 2 but the overall dimension is quite same. I hate Samsung’s plastic housings that make the phones feel cheap compared to devices like the HTC One and\xa0iPhone but The\xa0 Galaxy Note 3 \xa0 has a back covered with leather, which adds a bit of protection. I hope to see more innovation from Samsung when it comes to design because at the moment Sony & HTC are winning!  Display   The screen display on the Galaxy Note 3 is spectacular. With a super AMOLED screen, it’s ridiculously bright, the contrast is outstanding and the clarity is terrific as seen in Samsung Galaxy S4. With a bigger screen, carrying the Note 3 is like carrying a beautiful Samsung HDTV in your pocket.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Samsung Galaxy Note 3  Hardware  The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is powered by Samsung’s Exynos 5 Octa 5420 processor which is basically a set of two quad-core processors in big.LITTLE architecture — a 1.9GHz  Cortex A15  quad-core processor and a 1.3GHz  Cortex A7  quad-core processor that work together to optimize power and performance. It has 3GB RAM onboard, and a Mali T628 MP6 chip for processing graphics. Our review unit had 32GB of expandable built-in storage, out of which 24GB was available for our use. The performance is the biggest asset with the phone. It can handle multitasking with easy and gaming is a delight.  The Galaxy Note 3 features a 13-megapixel rear camera that takes excellent shots in daylight and good artificial light, a little better than the one seen in the Galaxy S4. Low-light shots are an area of weakness. Pictures come out distorted and noisy if it’s too dark. The phone can’t match the low-light performance of the HTC One or Nokia Lumia series. The Galaxy Note 3’s 2-megapixel front camera does a decent job when it comes to video chats.  Software  The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, the latest iteration of the OS (at the time of launching) and Touch Wiz Nature UX, Samsung’s own UI that includes custom apps in addition to a skinned interface.  S pen  The S Pen is the primary reason for the success of the Note line of smartphones. The special stylus brings added functionality to Samsung’s devices, allowing users to quickly take onscreen notes, draw pictures, and much more. Samsung added, even more, functionality to its S Pen stylus in the Galaxy Note 3.  Verdict:  If you are looking for a huge screen with a great camera, excellent battery life, and Spen functionality, this is your smartphone. Though it will cost you a high amount of money but look at the specs, you won’t regret it.  GADGETBYTE RATING: 4.5/5']",['https://oss.gadgetbytenepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/note.png']
"['Iphone 5S vs 5C, 5 things you should know!']","['Apple', 'Reviews']",['By Yural Maskey -  '],"['November 18, 2013']",2013-11-18 04:08:54+00:00,"['Yeah, apple announced two new smartphones at once. Though its been a while of these announcements but the Nepalese market is still taking these smartphones fresh, so we decided to enlist some points the intended buyers must know before buying this device.  Here we go!         The Outside  Both of the designs follow the rigid build structure from apple. I was very much disappointed that apple didn’t cut-off its pricing even though it totally cut-off its design in the iPhone 5C. Yeah, it might be unapolo-whatever plastic but hey, its still a plastic and costs as much a plastic back costs which was not $550 definitely. Regardless of overpricing, the device is sturdy feels good in you hands and leaves some smudges although you won’t notice much of it. The best part to some people is that its colorful now and that might attract youngsters  Talking of the iPhone 5S, it follows the unibody-metal hierarchy of the apple design and really does well to prove its point. I was surprised by the lightness and sturdyness of the device. Its back it scratch-free, smudge-free and of course, apology-free! Like its younger brother it is not available in much of colors,but the latest additions are Silver, Space-Grey and a Gold model.  The Inside  Both of them come equipped with ios7. Although people have mixed reactions regarding the new ios, i personally love it! I believe apple needed a design overhaul and yet they’ve managed to not-let-go the beauty of apple design inside a subtle and clean design which equally complements its retina display. One thing to note is that the iPhone 5S comes with a fingerprint sensor instead of the traditional home button which is a cool addition by apple. One can just put in their thumb or whichever finger to set up the touch id and log in or even purchase with just your fingerprint! That is both secure and viable means of personalization and security until apple doesn’t store our info in their iCloud database, which  they said they won’t!  The Power  The Iphone 5C has the same processor to that of the iPhone 5, dual core A6 chipset, which is ok for normal operations but will show a big difference when compared with the 5S.  On the other hand 5S has the brand new 64bit \xa0A7 processor with a M7 co-processor that deals with motion. With the new chipset architecture, apple becomes the leader in equipping 64x tech to the mobile computing. All these things make it a performance beast, no doubt.  The storage options on both the devices can be selected when buying.  The Camera  The new iSight camera on iPhone\xa05s\xa0features a state-of-the-art 8MP sensor with bigger pixels, a larger ƒ/2.2 aperture, True Tone flash. Now a true-tone flash is a method of using two separate flashlights with a timing that will adjust according to the lighting environments and give you the perfect picture with flash! The differences are quite notable as you can see in the demo image. Moreover, 5S has the new Slo-mo ability that lets you capture videos in higher frames so that you can have the “slow-motion” effect later, cool, huh!?  Moreover, the camera is back-illuminated with a larger sensor to allow low-light capabilities.  But we the 5C, all these abilities is what you can just talk off. The camera in 5C is same as to that of 5 with no improvements. So, nothing new for the brother.  The price  There is a difference of $100 between two devices with iPhone 5S at $650 and iPhone 5C at $550. Although in Nepal the prices for both are Rs. 95,000 for 5S and Rs. 68,000-70,000 for 5C according to Digital Electronics.  WRAP UP  Although both of these devices are good, i’d rather opt for spending $100 more and buying an iPhone 5S than the 5C. Had the price of 5C been around $350-$400 it would have given tough competition to the lumia lineups and samsung phones but nevertheless, apple devices are premiumly priced and although there’s no reason for spending the same amount on plastic to that on metal, if you want to buy an iPhone with colors, you are most welcomed!  I guess there’s no competition with 5S and 5C, 5S wins the race obviously. But 5C isn’t that bad either, you can easily save yourself some bucks and get the Apple experience!
